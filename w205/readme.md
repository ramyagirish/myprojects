In this project, I developed a complete web-based application that could create accounts for users, store the log of their daily dietary intake and health information such as weight and height in a backend data base system (maintained in PostgreSQL) and displayed the history of this information using bar charts. In short a health tracker. The project mainly demonstrated the capability of the application to handle the Big Data challenges of Volume, Velocity and Variety. 

A short demonstration could be found on Youtube:
