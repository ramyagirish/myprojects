"[*Muhammad was married to thirteen women, including eleven at one time. He relegated them to either consecutive days or (according to some accounts) all in one night. He had sex with a 9-year-old girl and married his adopted son's wife (after arranging a quick divorce). On top of that, Muhammad had a multitude of slave girls and concubines with whom he had sex - sometimes on the very days in which they watched their husbands and fathers die at the hands of his army.*](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/muhammads-sex-life.aspx)"

"I’ve never posted to this subreddit before, and I doubt anyone will see this. That being said I need to vent about the acquittal of Kate Steinle’s killer.  Never, have I been so disgusted by our country’s legal system, to let an illegal immigrant murder a naturally born U.S. citizen with an illegally acquired weapon. The Judge, Jurors, Law Enforcement, Border Patrol etc. not only failed this woman, her family, and friends, but also failed their state, and country by setting a legal precedent for the foreseeable future. It isn’t like there wasn’t evidence against Zarate either, he was convicted on a count of illegal possession of a firearm, but they believe he didn’t fire on purpose, I find that hard to believe. I’m not going to blame the left, or the right, only the jurors. They made a horrible decision, and let an illegal immigrant killer, who had been deported multiple times, walk back to Mexico. This entire incident, has made me completely rethink my stance on Border Security, not only here in the U.S. but for every country around the world. This is the OJ case of my generation, and again the jury failed. I respect our legal system, and therefore will respect the verdict, but the jury made a mistake letting Kate’s killer walk.  I love my country, it is the greatest country in the world without a doubt in my mind, but the legal system truly failed this time, and I am disgusted, and I genuinely hope it doesn’t happen again.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the Steinle family.  EDIT: The Killers name was Zarate not Zapata"

"When one thinks of mass murder, Hitler comes to mind. If not Hitler, then Tojo, Stalin, or Mao. Credit is given to the 20th-century totalitarians as the worst species of tyranny to have ever arisen. However, the alarming truth is that Islam has killed more than any of these, and may surpass all of them combined in numbers and cruelty.  The enormity of the slaughters of the ""religion of peace"" are so far beyond comprehension that even honest historians overlook the scale. When one looks beyond our myopic focus, Islam is the greatest killing machine in the history of mankind, bar none.  The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. -- Will Durant, as quoted on Daniel Pipes site.  Conservative estimates place the number at 80 million dead Indians.  According to some calculations, the Indian (subcontinent) population decreased by 80 million between 1000 (conquest of Afghanistan) and 1525 (end of Delhi Sultanate). -- Koenrad Elst as quoted on Daniel Pipes site  80 Million?! The conquistadors' crimes pale into insignificance at that number. No wonder Hitler admired Islam as a fighting religion. He stood in awe of Islam, whose butchery even he did not surpass.  Over 110 Million Blacks were killed by Islam.  ... a minumum of 28 Million African were enslaved in the Muslim Middle East. Since, at least, 80 percent of those captured by Muslim slave traders were calculated to have died before reaching the slave market, it is believed that the death toll from 1400 years of Arab and Muslim slave raids into Africa could have been as high as 112 Millions. When added to the number of those sold in the slave markets, the total number of African victims of the trans-Saharan and East African slave trade could be significantly higher than 140 Million people. -- John Allembillah Azumah, author of The Legacy of Arab-Islam in Africa: A Quest for Inter-religious Dialogue  Add just those two numbers alone together, and Islam has surpassed the victims of 20th-century totalitarianism. However, it does not end there. Add the millions who died at the hand of Muslims in the Sudan in our lifetime.  Much of Islamic slavery was sexual in nature, with a preference for women. Those men who were captured were castrated. The mulatto children of the women were often killed, which explains why Islam was not demographically shifted towards the black race, unlike slaves in the West, who bore children to breed a mestizo class. Add in those dead children; and we arrive at well over 200 million.  Remember that in the 7th century, North Africa was almost totally Christian. What happened to them?  By the year 750, a hundred years after the conquest of Jerusalem, at least 50 percent of the world's Christians found themselves under Muslim hegemony… Today there is no indigenous Christianity in the region [of Northwest Africa], no communities of Christians whose history can be traced to antiquity.-- ""Christianity Face to Face with Islam,"" CERC  What happened to those Christian millions? Some converted. The rest? Lost to history.  We know that over 1 million Europeans were enslaved by Barbary Pirates. How many died is anybody's guess.  ...for the 250 years between 1530 and 1780, the figure could easily have been as high as 1,250,000 - BBC  In the Middle Ages…  …many slaves were passed through Armenia and were castrated there to fill the Muslim demand for eunuchs. -- Slavery in Early Medieval Europe.  The same practice ran through Islamic Spain. North Europeans captured from raids up to Iceland, or purchased, were butchered in the castratoriums of Iberia. Many died from the operations that ran for centuries.  The number of dead from the Muslim conquest of the Balkans and Southern Italy is unknown, but again the numbers add up, surely into the millions over the centuries. Don't forget the 1.5 million Armenian Christians killed by the Turks during WWI. We do know that over five centuries, vast numbers of Christian boys were kidnapped to become Islamic Janissary mercenaries for the Turks. Add those in, too.  Muslims prized blonde women for their harems; and so enslaved Slavic women were purchased in the bazaars of the Crimean Caliphate. In Muslim Spain, an annual tribute of 100 Visigothic [blonde] women was required from Spain's Cantabrian coast.  For decades, 100 virgins per year were required by the Muslim rulers of Spain from the conquered population. The tribute was only stopped when the Spaniards began fighting back -- Jihad: Islam's 1,300 Year War Against Western Civilisation  Add in the death toll from the Reconquista and the numbers climb higher.  Research has shown that the Dark Ages were not caused by the Goths, who eventually assimilated and Christianized:  …the real destroyers of classical civilization were the Muslims. It was the Arab Invasions... which broke the unity of the Mediterranean world and turned the Middle Sea -- previously one of the world’s most important trading highways -- into a battleground. It was only after the appearance of Islam... that the cities of the West, which depended upon the Mediterranean trade for their survival, began to die. -- Islam Caused the Dark Ages  Add in those unknown millions who died as a consequence.  How many know the horrors of the conquest of Malaysia? The Buddhists of Thailand and Malaysia were slaughtered en masse.  When attacked and massacred by the Muslims, the Buddhists initially did not make any attempt to escape from their murderers. They accepted death with an air of fatalism and destiny. And hence they are not around today to tell their story. – History of Jihad.org  We may never know the numbers of dead.  After Muslims came to power in the early 15th century, animist hill peoples eventually disappeared due to their enslavement and ‘incorporation’ into the Muslim population of Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java via raids, tribute and purchase, especially of children. Java was the largest exporter of slaves around 1500. -- Islam Monitor  In the same manner, Islam arrived in the Philippines. Only the appearance of the Spanish stopped a total collapse, and confined Islam to the southern islands.  The coming of the Spanish saved the Philippines from Islam, except for the Southern tip where the population had been converted to Islam.-- History ofJihad.org  Again, the number of dead is unknown; but add them to the total.  The animist Filipinos were eager to ally with the Spanish against Islam. In fact, much of Southeast Asia welcomed the Spanish and Portuguese as preferable to Islam.  ...from the 17th century successive Thai kings allied themselves with the seafaring Western powers – the Portuguese and the Dutch and succeeded in staving off the threat of Islam from the Muslim Malays and their Arab overlords.-- History of Jihad.org  A few galleons and muskets were not enough to conquer Asia. Islam had made the Europeans initially appear as liberators; and to a certain extent they were. Who were the real imperialists?  Even today...  ...Malaysian Jihadis are plotting to transform multi-ethnic Malaysia into an Islamic Caliphate, and fomenting trouble in Southern Thailand.-- History ofJihad.org  Add this all up. The African victims. The Indian victims. The European victims. Add in the Armenian genocide. Then add in the lesser known, but no doubt quite large number of victims of Eastern Asia. Add in the jihad committed by Muslims against China, which was invaded in 651 AD. Add in the Crimean Khanate predations on the Slavs, especially their women.  Though the numbers are not clear, what is obvious is that Islam is the greatest murder machine in history bar none, possibly exceeding 250 million dead. Possibly one-third to one-half or more of all those killed by war or slavery in history can be traced to Islam; and this is just a cursory examination.  Now consider the over 125 Million women today who have been genitally mutilated for Islamic honor's sake. In spite of what apologists tell you, the practice is almost totally confined to Islamic areas.  New information from Iraqi Kurdistan raises the possibility that the problem is more prevalent in the Middle East than previously believed and that FGM is far more tied to religion than many Western academics and activists admit. – “Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?” ME Quarterly  Once thought concentrated in Africa, FGM has now been discovered to be common wherever Islam is found.  There are indications that FGM might be a phenomenon of epidemic proportions in the Arab Middle East. Hosken, for instance, notes that traditionally all women in the Persian Gulf region were mutilated. Arab governments refuse to address the problem. -- ""Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?"" ME Quarterly  Remember that this has gone on for 1400 years; and was imposed on a population that had been formerly Christian or pagan.  FGM is practiced on large scale in Islamic Indonesia; and is increasing.  ...far from scaling down, the problem of FGM in Indonesia has escalated sharply. The mass ceremonies in Bandung have grown bigger and more popular every year. -- Guardian  The horrified British author of that Guardian article is still deluded that Islam does not support FGM, when in fact it is now settled that FGM is a core Islamic practice. Islamic women have been brainwashed to support their own abuse.  Abu Sahlieh further cited Muhammad as saying, ""Circumcision is a sunna (tradition) for the men and makruma (honorable deed) for the women."" -- “Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?” ME Quarterly  What other tyranny does this? Not even the Nazis mutilated their own women!  Unlike the 20th-century totalitarians whose killing fury consumed themselves, reducing their longevity, Islam paces itself. In the end, though slower, Islam has killed and tortured far more than any other creed, religious or secular. Unlike secular tyranny, Islam, by virtue of its polygamy and sexual predations, reproduces itself and increases.  Other tyrannies are furious infections, which burn hot, but are soon overcome. Islam is a slow terminal cancer, which metastasizes, and takes over. It never retreats. Its methods are more insidious, often imperceptible at first, driven by demographics. Like cancer, excision may be the only cure.  So whenever you read about this or that Israeli outrage -- and there may be truth to the complaint -- place the news in context. Look whom the Israelis are fighting against. Islam is like nothing else in history."

"Libs' have it backward. Mueller has nothing. Pure politics. Timed for Friday, just as with Manafort.  1. 1/3 Common misconception: Prosecutors entice cooperation with minor charge and threaten to drop hammer w/ big charges later if cooperation not adequate. No: That would front load benefit of deal before cooperator has provided info/testimony.  2. 2/3 Competent prosecutors make cooperator plead guilty to big charge. Coop’r thus over barrel: if he doesn’t cooperate, will be sentenced without leniency on big charge he has already pled to. This incents coop’r to earn leniency.  3. 3/3 If Mueller had collusion case, he’d make Flynn plead guilty to big charge and earn sentencing leniency by cooperating. Instead, Flynn pled to small charge - process crime, likely no jail time - on promise of future cooperation. So there is no collusion case."

If the Democrats truly cared about Mexicans and wanted them to emigrate they would reform legal immigration while building the wall. It's callous and inhumane to promote a desert crossing as acceptable for Mexicans and other South Americans. Most of the women are raped and many of them die.    I'm not even saying that legal immigration should be easier but it is the logical conclusion for someone who wants people to be able to move freely across the border.   Why don't the Dems push for that? And why aren't we pointing out their apparent racism in allowing this to happen. Someone should be asking this question on national TV. 
"What we have been seeing this year is incredible. Americans everywhere are starting to put their foot down to the millionaires playing a game protesting because they're so ""oppressed"".

People don't want to buy and people who have season tickets don't want to go.  Which brings me to my point.   Next year, all of the people who now don't attend games, but had previously bought season tickets, will not be renewing this. People are tired of the NFL spitting on our American flag.   Excited to see it crash and burn. As a lifelong football fan (mainly college), it pains me to say. But as long as they continue to hate America, I won't be tuning in."

The Trump transition team state didnt need to get the Obama team permission as a transition team doesnt need their permission to contact any foreign leaders but Obama's administration DID give permission and said it themselves in january 2017 and Obamas team was required by law to assist the Trump transition team if asked.  In official video press breifing Obama state department specifically stated they had no problem with Flynn or anyone on the transition team contacting russia or anyone else and would even help them do it if asked. (28 minute mark) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vO3GNexHYI&amp;t=28m25s    Its actually normal and incumbent presidents are required to help by law.

Garcia Zarate had been deported multiple times. After returning illegally multiple times you can be charged as a felon. The simple act of him being here illegally after being deported multiple times was a felony which means he committed murder while committing a felony. Which also means his intent to kill is a non-issue as he should be tried and convicted for felony murder. The prosecutor for this must be a proponent of sanctuary city law.  
"Are elections fair anymore? I honestly believe Trump won by a much larger margin than he did. The actual number of Trump voters just overwhelmed their shady tactics ... they flat out didn't expect that turnout or for Trump to even win for that matter (I personally don't believe they'll let it happen again) But that's a discussion for 2020.  But, the current election Roy Moore....... With all these Deep staters spewing anti-Trump sentiment and with all Trump's recent wins don't you think they'll 100% fix this election?

"""Then “Today” co-host Meredith Vieira was especially crude, making jokes about Lauer and Roker partaking in anal sex during the Turin Olympics, with Roker as the receiving partner. Former “Today” star Katie Couric went next, reading a David Letterman-style Top 10 list of facts about Lauer. Among the digs, “No. 10 -- According to his wife, he’s not really an early riser, if you know what I mean.”  But a shot at Lauer’s in-office relationship with Curry, who was in the room, got the biggest laugh of Couric’s routine.  “No. 2 -- He loves to eat Curry,” she said as Curry (sitting in the audience) went pale and the crowd roared with laughter. “What? Indian food! What’s wrong with you people?”  Comic Bob Saget eventually took the stage to offer Lauer some marriage advice: “Do what I’m doing, Matt. Come into the Dark Side. My next wife hasn’t even been born yet.”  Another comedian -- one attendee believes it was comedian Jeff Ross -- made racist jokes about Lauer using a naked Roker on all fours as his coffee table.  Comedian Gilbert Gottfried was so obscene that Fox News can’t even publish a highly expurgated version of his material, but part of his racist routine – filled with Asian sex jokes about Ann Curry -- included detailed remarks about Curry’s genitals.  But the most cringeworthy comments, in hindsight, were made by Lauer himself, who spoke at the end of the roast. The “Today” star alluded to sex with two former colleagues, Couric and Curry.  “Let me just say that I saw that colon a lot before the rest of you saw it,” Lauer said in an anal sex joke about Couric (who famously underwent a colonoscopy on air).  But the twice-married Lauer wasn’t finished joking about sleeping with female contemporaries.  “What’s with all the small-d--- jokes? It was fun to look over and see Ann Curry laughing… like she doesn’t know how big my d--- really is,” Lauer said, wrapping up an event that The Village Voice called “three hours of d--- jokes.”  http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/05/media-elite-laughed-at-2008-roast-sending-up-matt-lauer-s-pervy-behavior.html"

"&gt; Comey said in a statement: “I am grateful to the Department of Justice’s IG for taking on this review. He is professional and independent and the FBI will cooperate fully with him and his office. I hope very much he is able to share his conclusions and observations with the public because everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter.”  Kadzik: &gt; In an interview, Kadzik, who said he was speaking in his personal capacity, called the inspector general’s investigation “disheartening.” He noted that the information he gave Podesta about a hearing and a court document already was public and that it came before the FBI opened its criminal investigation.  &gt;Of whether he should have recused himself from any involvement in that criminal probe, Kadzik said, “It’s not as if I had any decision-making authority or role in the criminal investigation.”  &gt;Kadzik declined to say whether he would cooperate with the inspector general’s probe.

"The man advocated on behalf of pedophiles stating that the punishment they face is too severe and that they shouldn’t be demonized. He said everyone thinks pedophilia as an absolutely unforgivable act when we shouldn’t take it so seriously.   Now here’s where it really got rich...  He stated a pedophile can’t physically harm a child by sexually abusing them, they can only cause psychological harm. As if this wasn’t already atrocious enough he continued to state that those who watch child pornography shouldn’t go to jail because there’s a chance they will get killed there.   This is what a college education in 2017 looks like.   He repeated himself several times saying “I’m not advocating for pedophilia, but realistically, if an individual has to say that in defense of their argument, chances are they are advocating for pedophilia.

See Maddie's Facebook post below which goes into better detail.  What's wrong with Fix NICS you might ask?  It relies on the Obama administration's policy of allowing agency bureaucrats to report thousands of names to a database to deny people the right to purchase a firearm without due process.  This violates the 2nd and 6th Amendments.  The senate version of Fix NICS was sponsored by Schumer and Feinstein.  Call and write your representatives and tell them to say NO to HR 4477.  We want Reciprocity but it will do us no good if they can just restrict our rights without due process.

United States Financial restrictions on the purchase and sale of Bitcoins is causing one of the greatest shifts of wealth in the history of the world to go to citizens of other countries instead of the citizens of the United States.  Americans are heavily restricted in the amounts of purchase and sale and exchanges thus limit them severely.  End FinCen  If they had done to the internet in the 90's what FinCen has done to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies then Silicon Valley would be located in another country now.  Crypto should be unregulated just as they literlally passed a bill in ongress to keep the internet and internet commerce from being regulated as it was emerging.  President Trump as head of the Executive Branch hasthe authroity to personally make the administartive decision to undo all the FinCen regulations which were put in place without acts of congress.  He should do it immediately before the wealth has all gone to foreign buyers and adopters.

"Recently, while I was working on the flower beds in my front yard, my neighbours stopped for a chat as they returned from walking their dog.  During our friendly conversation, I asked their little girl what she wanted to be when she grew up. She said she wanted to be Prime Minister some day.   Both her parents, Liberal Party members, were standing there, so I asked her, ""If you were Prime Minister, what would be the first thing you would do?"" She replied, ""I would give food and houses to all the homeless people.""   Her parents beamed with pride! ""Wow! What a worthy goal!"" I said. ""But you don't have to wait until you're Prime Minister to do that."" ""What do you mean?"" she replied.   So I told her, ""You can come over to my house and mow the lawn, pull weeds and trim hedge, and I'll pay you $50. Then you can go over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out, and you can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.""   She thought that over for a few seconds, then looked me straight in the eye and asked, ""Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?""   I said, ""Welcome to the Conservative Party."" Her parents aren't speaking to me anymore."

John Roberts on Fox just announced they have received word the subpoena doesn't exit. It didn't happen. Fake News. Awaiting official sources.
"A friend and I were talking about it and I decided to do a little digging. The only sources I used for information on the nine accusers was Time magazine and QZ (Quartz media) which has been rated as right down the middle but employs people from The Atlantic and The WSJ, the atlantic of course being the far more egregious of the two. So here's a summation of the nine accusers using their own data with a preamble of what I wrote back to him:  The whole Roy Moore thing stinks to high hell. It's all boiled down to ""if you don't BELIEVE these women, you're a rape apologist and victim shaming"". We just saw this last year with Trump, trot out a whole bunch of women who have accusations that are unverifiable from 30 years ago and let the court of public opinion have its say because there's nothing actually admissible in court. He can't sue for slander or libel because he's not being hurt directly and it'd be near-impossible to show they're outright lying so there's nothing holding them back legally from throwing it all against the wall. And neither for Trump or Moore it makes sense. They've both been public figures for decades....but conveniently accusations are brought right when it matters most? Just NOW they decided to speak up?  The Moore thing too is littered with easy to dismiss nonsense. ""He has NINE accusers"" (cue: nine times from teh Ferris Bueller principal). Ok well let's take a look.   * One was in high school, he asked her for a date at the mall. She said no.....that's it. OK down to 8 accusers.  * One was above the age of consent when she stated BY HER OWN ADMISSION they dated off and on for several months and her mom knew and approved of him, going so far to say that he's marriage material because he's an already established assistant DA. That's all for her. Down to 7 accusers.  * A third, the big one who hired Allred, alleges actual sexual misconduct...but has no proof. She and Gloria instead trot out a yearbook he happened to sign as incontrovertible proof he sexually assaulted her and in a way you and I would actually consider sexual assault. When Moore goes ""that's horseshit, lets have a handwriting expert take a look"" Allred refuses and it's been two weeks. That's the entire summation of the evidence she has. She stated he groped her, pushed her head towards her crotch (both heresay and inadmissible) and signed a yearbook, the only piece of admissible evidence, which her lawyer refuses to let an impartial party examine. Additionally, her own son calls her take on it complete nonsense and Roy Moore preceded over her divorce hearings during which at no point did she ask for a change of venue due to her and Roy's previous encounter. So she WON'T tell her attorney back then to ask for a change of venue (and as you know, he could make up any number of reasons including ""it's a small town and we'd like to go somewhere where the judge may not consciously or subconsciously have a bias towards one of the parties"") but she WILL tell a Washington Post reporter just all willy nilly? And how did that reporter find her and the other women? ""While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls."" Interesting, so they were actively digging for dirt then? She stated she told her sister what had happened two years after the alleged incident, told her husband before they got married and also told her mother about four years ago. The only response any of those three have given to corroborate is her sister ""recalling a conversation"" but not verifying the content of that discussion nor the validity of the content she was told. Per Allred, ""Nelson's younger sister is unlikely to give a public statement regarding the allegations"". Down to 6 accusers. This one is Beverly Young Nelson. * A FOURTH was by her own admission, 18 and said they dated off and on 'and he gave me booze' which he denied. She also stated they did nothing besides kiss. Boy, looks to me like he's a dude in his early 30's who likes dating barely legal girls but respects the hell out of boundaries. Down to 5 accusers. * A fifth was TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. Wait, I thought he was a pedophile? So he likes super young girls or he doesn't, I'm confused. She was visiting his law office with her mother, though to sign over custody of her 12 year old son to her mother since she was going through a divorce. Interesting. Typically when divorces happen, don't one parent or the other or both get custody? Must have been a real serious, contentious and unsafe divorce if a child is not only being given to the grandparent but already living with them. But as for the allegations, 'he got so close to me I could smell his breath and when my mother left he grabbed my butt'. Ooh, way to paint a picture, you could smell his breath and you remember what color dress you were wearing? Well if that doesn't prove your story is true I'm not sure what will! Down to 4 accusers. * A sixth, at the age of 22 said he repeatedly asked her out at the mall and she said no. Nothing else. At all. Seems to me that, even if true, is nothing more than harassment, certainly not an allegation worth even discussing. Down to three. * A 7th, said she was asked out by Moore multiple times working at that mall when she was 16, and before that their only interaction was when she was 14 working at the mall as Santa's Helper and he told her she was pretty. Boy, interesting to remember a single interaction from 14 that lasted probably under 10 seconds. Her mom told her she was not allowed to go out with him even though she states ""I was flattered at the time"". As for her mom? Dead. Unable to verify any veracity of the claim. No actual contact. Down to 2. * A girl was working at a Red Lobster as a hostess at 17 and said he came in and asked her out. She said no as she was in a relationship, and asked if he knew how old she was. He said ""yes I go out with girls your age all the time"". End of that story! Nothing happened, no contact, yet again another turned down date equals accusation of sexual misconduct. * The ninth is the only other one that would be sexual assault by our reasonable definition. Leigh Corfman said at 14 he asked for her number, which she gave to him and a few days later he drove to her house and kissed her. On a second visit he made her grab his dick over his underwear. She asked him to drive her home which he did, meaning he stopped at a dry half a handjob through his underwear if true. There was no additional contact. Moore says he has no idea who she is and no evidence presented by anyone shows otherwise.  THAT'S IT. So let's sum up. Nine total accusers, two actually meet criteria for sexual assault if true, though one presents no evidence whatsoever and a 2nd presents solely a yearbook as physical proof while having previously been charged with fraud I believe and found guilty of a lesser crime based on a plea bargain. Hard to find when I googled it, shocking I know. Allred also admitted she ""hadn't asked"" Nelson if she had actually seen Moore physically sign her yearbook in person. The other 7? One was a butt grope, with no way to prove it, four were turned down dates WITH NO PHYSICAL CONTACT BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION and two were openly dating after being past the age of consent. So.....what's the issue? Why are there ""nine accusers""? Hell, if every girl I asked on a date and said no then ""accused me of sexual impropriety"" the list would be a mile long. How about multiple one night stands based off online dating where both of us were drinking? Those in play? It's beyond absurd. I'll grant that those two legitimate accusations need to be taken with sincerity and seriousness but Allred is bound and determined to obstruct any third party from looking at any evidence. They blew their load too early, if they were going to file a civil or criminal complaint they needed to have done it by now. After all you have nine accusers right?! Oh wait there's not an argument any court in the land would accept for six of them and the 7th wouldn't be able to win so much as a civil claim based on the preponderance of the evidence because a butt grab not even seen by her dead mother won't hold any water.   But don't worry Stephen Colbert will have 5 of them on the day before the election I'm sure. And everyone will think Roy Moore actively fucked kids. It's out and out lying and disingenuousness from everyone on the left trying to save their own skin before so many of their own get busted as pedophiles or guilty of sexual assault."

"It's a *freedom to discriminate* issue.   The government has no place forcing the hand of a private entity, who should have the right to deny service or association for whatever reason they choose.   ""Discrimination"" is not a bad thing. You discriminate in your love life, when choosing a career or job, when buying different products, when deciding what food to eat or which tie to wear. Discrimination is choice, plain and simple.   Freedom to discriminate is a hallmark American principle, and you only forfeit that freedom once you start taking taxpayer money, because it is *indiscriminant*. For instance, the ISP monopoly is backed somewhat by the government, so ISPs should not have the freedom to discriminate against consumers. However, private businesses and individuals should not be being harassed by the government for not providing goods or services to whomever for whyever.  Freedom of Discrimination protects most other rights, including association and religion. Don't wanna serve pork because you're a Muslim? Fine, you're free to discriminate. Don't even need to bring your religion into the equation. Don't wanna serve white people because you just don't like them? That's fine too. This is America, the land of opportunity and consequence, where you take the opportunities you want and deal with the consequences of your actions (which, by the way, is the basis of free market capitalism). Depriving individuals and private businesses of the freedom to discriminate takes those consequences away from them, and creates crony capitalism, aka crapitalism.  ""Discrimination"" is a term often REEEEEEE'd about, but that's just because it's been co-opted by Marxists in an attempt to divide and conquer. We need to take it back for ourselves."

Was she really shocked by the news? Did she really not know what was going on?  Oh, she knew.  Actually, she more than knew.  She was part of his feeder system. She would find pretty young girls for him and hand them some B.S. about “You know, if you are serious about your career, you should really meet Harvey.” They were so excited that she was personally taking an interest in them and giving their number to a big Hollywood producer.

"He fooled Americans because Silicon Valley minipulated the conversation. Facebook shut down his opponents, Twitter banned those willing to speak out, and the Main Stream Media lied to Americans. Finally, at least 3 million illegal votes were cast. Thank God, Donald J. Trump won in 2016."

Was there a sticky for the WH press conference today?  Found it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7j4622/your_daily_press_huckabeating/.  Here's a chunk of it:  https://youtu.be/0BjylDelAac
AL - GO VOTE FOR MOORE.  That is all
Just a friendly reminder.
People warned him. I warned him. I think something happened to him. He has not responded to messages. I am really worried about him. Pray for him. I just have a bad feeling.
"Went to 3 different Christmas parties tonight in cucked Philly. Within 2 minutes of engaging in the first  conversations at each, I was immediately placed at the listening end of some jabroni cuck spewing anti trump nonsense. Completely unprovoked mind you (I keep my thoughts to myself).   A year later and Trump is all they think about. Its such a wonderful thought. I know we all know but experience it first hand again drove me to post here.   Imagine hating something so much that it consumes your everyday life and you need to talk about it in every open setting as some sort of release. That's no way to live and they better get used to it.   Love trumps hate. Bring on 2020.  "
With the Moore and Trump Jr stories simultaneously collapsing today I feel it’s only fair
"I believe Trump or another trusted person in the White House planted false information in a contained manner so they could find the leaker.   And when it was leaked, they knew who the leaker was, she was talked to, and they agreed she should step down. "
google can suck it
"Just somewhat of an incoherent rant here.  Right now, our science hasn't  evolved enough to pinpoint the exact moment the spark of life enters a fetus.     Pro abortion asshats use that to kill kill kill.   I believe our science and understanding will greatly improve within the next 50 years.. and our society will tear down everything that has to do with anyone that is pro abortion.      I'm not religious in any way, but life is life. A baby shouldn't be slaughtered simply because the woman determines that the baby may be an inconvenience.    This is one of the big reasons I voted for our glorious potus.    His anti abortion stance.   "

He was a huge fan of The Strange Death of Europe, and nowI'd love any book suggestions that help continue to explain how we've ended up where we've ended up in the world.   Going to grab Camille Paglia's ""Free Women, Free Men,"" but what else do you guys think is essential?  Also, I remember reading that Bill Clinton's globalist ideology all came from Carroll Quigley while at Georgetown. Wonder if there's a go-to text from that mindset as well?  Thanks for the help, y'all!"

"I work at a company that make and ships glass, and 90% of our products end up on construction jobs. Every year we've gotten a Christmas bonus ($100). This year, the man who built this company from scratch announced that due to this last year being our most profitable year **ever**, we would all be getting an increased Christmas bonus.   Great, I thought. Maybe we'll get $200, or even $300. No, I was wrong. Everybody in the plant got **$1,000**. The mood around the plant is astounding. Everybody is near tears, laughing, and working their assess off. I paid the boss a visit to personally thank him.   We talked about how, unlike every winter since I've been working here,**it's not slowing down**. It shows no signs of slowing down. Everybody is building, he says that our country's leadership has everything to do with it. Our economy is being unleashed, and it's helping out everybody in so many different industries.   So thank you, Donald Trump. Your brave decisions to put America's workers first is finally starting to bear fruit. My family is about to have the best Christmas ever.   Talking to my wife about all this was the last straw, too. She was undecided on the last election, but over the last year, everything from the fake news getting exposed, to the Democratic party falling apart, she announced she is now happy to board the Trump train. She says she can't wait to vote for Trump in 2020.   America is being made great again! Merry Christmas, pedes!"

"This holiday, Chanukah, is a celebration of a religious group of people that were getting flooded with Seleucid Greeks who refused to assimilate or integrate with the natives.   And, as you would expect, the Greeks began to enforce their pagan way of life on everyone soon enough.   The local Greek ruler would defile brides on their wedding night before they could consummate with their new husbands.   Tired of seeing his people cucked at swordpoint, the Trump of the day, Mattisyahu, said enough. He was going to make Judeah great again and the war was on.   The centipedes of the day were called Maccabees and they fought valiantly against an incredibly powerful army.   It took over 20 years to win the war and many died along the way but it was a war worth fighting.   If any of this sounds familiar, it’s because we are living it right now.   History shows that the brave are favored when they have a truly righteous cause.   As Chanukah draws to a close, I want to wish all of you a very merry Christmas and I’m proud to be fighting alongside all of you to make America great again.   A single candle can illuminate the darkest space.  "

"You can circumnavigate the bot-driven ban by spacing keywords in your comments. We obviously don't know the keywords right now (I've had trouble referencing M.uell er in the past), but maybe someone good at organising could get some sort of cross-referenced list going from submissions from people whose comments have been removed from threads? That would give us a roadmap of things they definitely do NOT want us talking about, which in turn will tell us exactly what we should be talking about.   Either way, a solution is to spa ce, or spa.ce keywords to get around the bot; I know it works because I figured it out weeks ago and have been trying to alert people to the fudgery going on ever since.

I know they are corrupt and arrogant but I'm finding it hard to believe Muller ever thought that team would not be exposed for what they are.

"What the hell is the Smith-Mundt Act?  Basically, it kept the US gov’t from broadcasting propaganda within the US like the USSR. In 2013, Obama repealed it claiming it would be used on immigrants from places such as Somalia.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith–Mundt_Act  Does it really allow the feds to broadcast propaganda in the US? Yes.   http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/  Everything I read this evening claimed it was all propaganda broadcast on radio and tv to any outlet that requested it. I didn’t see any mention of who those outlets were or if publications were included so I started digging.  I went to the BBG.gov site to see who some of their partners were and who was involved to look for connections to MSM. Here’s their FAQs:  https://www.bbg.gov/who-we-are/oversight/legislation/smith-mundt-faqs/#q2  I found the last entry VERY interesting. Their “work” is frequently cited in all of our favorite MSM outlets!  https://m.imgur.com/TuvacpH  I would appreciate if anyone else finds this interesting, if they wouldn’t mind digging and posting any info they can find on:  1. Samples of their work in MSM 2. Who runs the BBG and their connections 3. Who produces the stories that get cited 4. How the fuck do we get the Smith-Mundt act reinstated?  Thanks. ;-) "
"Anyone else notice that since ""Net Neutrality"" passed in 2015 the internet has become a MUCH MORE censored place? #ObamaNet"
Asking that question for anyone who legitimately knows. 
There is simply no reason there should be any linkage between economic trade and migrant policy. None.  And I very much doubt in any pre member stste discussions of the creation of the EU that anyone was told that its formation was contingent on accepting a flood of non european people.   (member state citizens borderless travel was well known of course)  Its now clear that the goal of the creators of the EU was to use it as an economic hammer to ensure the ethnocide of the european people.

Enjoy and rest up, next year will need eyes and ears open just as much as this year!  The tax cut is done so 2018 will be the year we find out who is really who.  Immigration (amnesty, daca, chain) and infrastructure will be yuge. If there is amnesty, all hope is lost and we will be continually overrun. If daca remains, we are screwed.   The 'infrastructure bank' seems to be another run at this:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Infrastructure_Reinvestment_Bank  First introduced in 2007/2008.

Just a bit of light reading for the new year."
"Everyone is wondering about President Trump. Aside from the tsunami of economic prosperity that is sweeping our nation, why is he right every time? EVERY TIME. Why is it that those that attack him seem to fall prey to some kind of a curse?  Why, as time progresses, is more evil revealed and why is so much of it vanquished?  How has he destroyed the Clintons, the Bushes, two political parties, the MSM and Hollywood perverts, ISIS and is taking apart our crooked Congress one Uniparty member at time?  I know that as each day progresses, I continually wag my head almost in disbelief at his ability to reveal and destroy evil.  Without our President, our country surely would have been destroyed and unrecoverable.  What if God is increasingly revealing good and evil through our President and eventually every last person on earth must take a side.  What is it going to be for you, good or evil?.....then the rapture.  Could this be what is going on?  Maybe.  Check out the only two verses that contain the word ""trump"" in the King James Version of the Bible.  Each of these two verses are rapture verses.  The word ""trump"" is in all caps as ""TRUMP"" in each of these verses for emphasis.  ""Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last TRUMP: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."" I Corinthians 15:51-52  ""For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the TRUMP of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.""  I Thessalonians 4:16-17  Maybe it is time for us to heed what was spoken by an Old Testament prophet said, ""Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways."" Haggai 1:7"

When you sign up with a referral link they give you one free share of random stock.   At some point in the future (we are targeting spring-ish) who ever has more money in their account wins.

And as a side benefit, the DW is learning about the stock market :-) so win win.

"I'm just a regular guy wanting to know if the transition emails turned over to Robert Mueller by the GSA are protected by the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. Below is a paragraph from that Act found on the GSA website. It's the only piece I can see as relevant.  Sec. 2. The Congress declares it to be the purpose of the Act to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a President and the inauguration of a new President. The national interest requires that such transitions in the office of President be accomplished so as to assure continuity in the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the affairs of the Federal Government, both domestic and foreign. Any disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and its people. Accordingly, it is the intent of the Congress that appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or minimize any disruption. In addition to the specific provisions contained in this Act directed toward that purpose, it is the intent of the Congress that all officers of the Government so conduct the affairs of the Government for which the exercise responsibility and authority as (1) to be mindful of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of President, (2) to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer of the executive power, and (3) otherwise to promote orderly transitions in the office of President.  So, does this Act protect the transition emails? If so wouldn't it be appropriate to get a court order to remove them from the Special Prosecutor's investigation? I'm just a curious taxpayer."

"Something that's been flying under the radar and I've not seen made light of much is the fact the Office of Inspector General of the DOJ, according to [shitbag Rosenstein's comments yesterday](https://youtu.be/BOMGZx22Q70?t=306), apparently has [500 employees and a 100M budget!](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/821976/download)  They've been investigating a slew of crimes since Sessions became head of DOJ. Is this what Sessions has been up to? Is this the agency that is driving the sealed indictment count up a bit and leaking things like the Strzok tweets and Ohr news?  It would make a lot of sense why some in the GEOTUS admin are pretty low key on a second special counsel to investigate the FBI. A special counsel is not actually needed since the OIG performs the same work and has vastly more resources than something like the Mueller show.  The larger question is, how reliable is the OIG and are they compromised?"

TAXES = REFORMED. And they said he wouldn't do shit in his first year. ROFL! 
"Im honestly not making this up. I was at Barnes &amp; Noble in the comic book section (Punisher!) and overheard these two guys in their late teens/early 20s talking about ski masks, breaking shit, going to rallies, etc.   Both were clearly mentally ill. One was talking about his schizophrenia diagnosis to the other. He said he couldn't buy anymore comic books until he figured out his diagnosis or something.  Reminded me of that scene in the Batman movie when Joker recruited the mentally ill. These kids/people are easily duped and want to fit in. Pretty disturbing but sad too.   I tried to record them but it wouldn't have been helpful since they weren't committing any crimes. "

"I got a fit bit for Christmas and when I set it up, there were only 2 options for gender! How dare they?"
"Being off work for Christmas has left me with a lot more free time than I’m used to and I won’t be traveling to spend it with my family until tomorrow.  Normally I only visit T_D because I’ve refused to watch Fake News my entire life and I believe there is a lot more transparency in journalism here despite “popular opinion”; joke about popular vote here.  As such, I always feel surrounded with an atmosphere of positivity and a forward-looking mindset into making things great again.  Plus the shtick about not wanting to win anymore never gets old or fails to put a smile on my face. Well with this free time I made the mistake of going to other parts of Reddit and what I saw left me in legitimate awe.   It wasn’t that long ago that I watched the video where the former KGB member discussed the methodology where Communism and altering the perception of a nation’s people was an effective, albeit lengthy, tactic to dismantle said nation.  Now – I am not a conspiracy theorist, but conspiracies are becoming more like realities every day it seems.  I understand the demographic of Reddit is probably not the best at encapsulating the feelings of a nation, but I feel it’s a large enough sample size to warrant my thoughts.  Everywhere I looked I saw - while possibly not obvious at a glance - at the very least, veiled disheartening and miserable comments that all shared similar attributes to one another.  I brushed it off at first, but after 30 minutes it was all I could see.   * There was **always** a negative spin on the topic. * There was **always** some sort of self-loathing feeling to the comments. * There was **always** a back handed victim complex.   And I wasn’t looking for these comments or cherry picking them.  These were all massively up-voted comments and I did find a few people who seemed to pick up on this that had responded.  I thought to myself thank God I’m not crazy!  But guess what?  I had to un-hide their comments because they’d all been down-voted like hell.    Then I started to think – well if I was trying to be the most depressing and miserable commenter I could be, just for the sake of doing it, this is the sort of thing I would say.  Then I started thinking about recent stories regarding ShareBlue and other groups whose sole purpose is to shill their agenda and attack or bury anything else; part of me hopes they read this because I’d be honored – but they better send their best!     I was not always a happy person.  And I know what you’re thinking, but no I never voted Democrat.  But, becoming a happy person was by far the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do in my entire life.  Harder than my career, harder than relationships with others, and our world is not always an easy place to be happy.  Even still, I have difficult days at work where I feel like my head will explode – but I leave it at the door and meditate on how I can be happy with it or make the best of it.  I would say being happy is a difficult and full time job – but pays out something which money can’t buy.     The danger I see in all of this is how many people who have not yet found happiness are becoming prey to the negativity of it all.  In my case, I always isolated myself because I did not want my feeling down or sad to be a burden on other people.  I was also far too embarrassed to discuss my problems or seek sympathy because I did not want to feel the way I did!  Feeling better about a bad situation or becoming complacent with it is an awful coping mechanism, but one that is readily available and far easier than bettering the situation for yourself.  I’d like to clarify here that I am not promoting isolating yourself or letting issues fester just to say you’re not being a burden on others like I did.  This only leads to anxiety, depression, and every day that you isolate yourself makes seeking help, whether it is professional or not, increasingly difficult.  There are good and honest people that want to legitimately help!  But as I’ve said, that is not the easy way out.  You have to want to help yourself first, many times that means hearing things you don’t want to hear or saying things you are afraid to say.  But that is alright because it is a means to an end that is not describable and unique to every single person.   But this influenza or feeling that I saw all over other parts of Reddit troubled me.  The fact that there are people out there acting as Misery’s Advocates, targeting the downtrodden and using them for personal gain disgusts and angers me.  My hope is that this post is read, seen, commented on, and even possibly to help someone.  Not because of the reality that T_D is the best venue for this message – I would be just as happy to have this thread buried and forgotten if it resonated with one person; seeking the affirmation of others is not a good metric for happiness.  And finally, I am more than willing to acknowledge opposing viewpoints on this topic if it means finding reason and understanding!  I am and always have been my biggest critic; very rarely will I act on something without first considering opposing viewpoints or weaknesses in my own views.  I just felt so strongly about this topic that I felt compelled to post it here.   I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and keep up the positive vibes and making America great again!  I can always count on finding that here at T_D. "

"It warms my heart to read T_D, I don't know too many people around here who aren't brainwashed by the liberal media. Even my own family disowned me when I made comments supporting the President. "
"Just discovered the site masquerading as this one. (No space between the and Donald) Does the left do anything honestly? Or are they just so aware that they're losers, that all they do is cheat at whatever they set up/get going? (like calling ""pay the insurance company"" bills ""the affordable care act."" Haha, that was a good one.)"
"When President Trump tweeted about climate change, it sent the left into a hysterical fit. My social media has been flooded with liberal propaganda about the climate. I need some information from some fellow conservatives. Do you think humans have any effect on our climate? Where can I find information that supports this argument? From a common sense standpoint, it seems easy to see the agenda being pushed here. All you have to do is look at our history from the 90's onward. Al Gore terrified people into buying into the narrative that the polar ice caps were melting, polar bears were going to become extinct, New York and Miami will be underwater, tornadoes, etc.  That never happened. I remember the term global warming was morphed into climate change which already occurs, and has long before humans. Whenever you try to inform a liberal of these facts they lose their collective minds. The arguments I see most are ""97% of scientist agree..."" and ""The temperature has risen steadily over the past 20 years."" Now, I can debunk the 97% argument easily, but where are they seeing this information on CO2 levels? I've been told that 2016 was the hottest year on record. I'm just not buying this information...mostly because any opposition to the argument is attacked aggressively. They say that science has no side, but clearly it has been hijacked by the left. If climate change/global warming is a scientific argument, then why are scientists that provide arguments that it's false shunned and blacklisted? Also, anytime I see these Hollywood actors living lifestyles that they condemn so vocally it makes me skeptical. Can I get some good articles and red flags that this is all just an agenda from the left?"

"Tax reform just passed officially, and starting in January 80% of us will start paying the government less each paycheck. For people in lower to middle class income levels, it's about 20% less each paycheck. For the wealthy it's about 5% each paycheck. Sure, 5% of a billionaire's taxes IS more than 20% of a guy who makes $40k a year. If you are low to middle income, with children, and you don't itemize deductions, then you are the big winner of the changes. If you are rich and have lots of deductions then you might have to pay more.  Businesses in the U.S. used to have the highest tax rate in the civilized world at 35%, but now will have a rate of 21% much like other countries (average of 22.5%). Economists expect this to result in increased wages, economic growth, slower price increases and lower unemployment.  ISIS has lost control of it's strong holds in Syria and Iraq. Military leaders credit the change of policies allowing them to aggressively act against threats as well as aggressively 'bombing the sh*t"" out of them.  Syria has finally stopped using chemical weapons as a direct result of the U.S. strike on their airstrip immediately following their one and only use of chemical weapons early this year.  The national debt is growing at half the speed as it did the last 10 years.  The U.S. needs q4 growth to be at 2.9% or higher to have the best economic growth in a decade... and early estimates are 4.0% or higher!  The stock market grew 35% since election night, a 3500% improvement over the previous two years of less than 1% annual growth. By the end of this week the stock market will have had more growth since the election than it did the rest of the days since 12-31-1999.  Unemployment shrank by .7%, seven times more than the previous year.  Home sales are higher than any time in last decade.  The U.S. now recognizes Israel's right to pick their own capital.  The individual mandate for Obamacare has been repealed. The government will no longer tax you more just for not being able to afford or not wanting health insurance.  The Supreme Court opening was filled in April.  Business regulations have been rolled back, resulting in the highest consumer confidence in decades.  Illegal immigration is at it's lowest in decades.  The US has pulled out of the Iran Nuclear Deal.  http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-senate-take-home-pay-changes-every-income-level-2017-12  http://fortune.com/2017/12/20/donald-trump-2017-accomplishments/  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/national-debt-grew-more-slowly-in-fy-2017-under-trump/article/2636311 "

Only after Sunday football... Oh wait they cancelled that game. Trump already has the ball.
Markets way down towards the end of the day. Now futures are way down. Anyone know whats up?

"Buying an exurban farm and I’m 20 minutes from the nearest cop, so I’ll need to purchase some firearms to protect myself and my loved ones from mountain lions, burglars, radical leftists, jihadists, thugs, and sexual predators (sorry for the redundancy).  What’s the best 3 gun combo of these types in terms of bang for my buck? Bonus points for matching brands, materials, and aesthetics because I like stuff that looks nice together (e.g., my socks match my shirts at work...ohhhh fine judge me). "
Thanks Jesus.
Your thoughts?
"....Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a MAGA new year. Thanks for all those spicy memes, shitposts and laugh-out-loud moments that brighten up my days, but thanks most of all for electing the badass shitposter-in-chief himself.  God bless you all, have a good one !!!      "
"She voted Trump. Her family listens to Rush and are God fearing 2A supporting Mericans, but she refuses the total red pill. She listens to me about Pedowood, corrupt CIA and FBI but when I wear my MAGA hat she refuses to get out of the truck with me. I love this country and this president has been the greatest in my lifetime, but how do I fully red pill my new family? Mine is based, my millennial sister is MAGA all day."
Based water merchant was speculating today if Eric Schmidt resigned from Google because of the Trump executive order crack down on human rights abusers and then dscussed the order as a preventing of young human trafficking  Then talked about the clinton  connection to haiti child trafficking and laura silsby now changed her name.
"My friend has had his brain fucking rotted by social justic warrior bullshit. For the past few years, he has been getting worse and worse with his horsehit, but within the past few months, and specifically past few days, it's become worse than it's ever been and I don't know what to do anymore.  We've always had disagreements. He's been left-leaning, but mostly a moderate. I'd call him more ""ignorant"" than actively leftist. When pressed on any major issue, he really has no idea what he's talking about.   That being said, his mind has been POISONED by the women he dates, and this last one has taken the fucking cake.   This girl not only is a social justice warrior, she is the fucking ultimate stereotype. She unironically says ""micro-agression"" in person, identifies as ""gender non-binary"" despite the fact that she's clearly a woman, she acts like a victim because she ""went to prison for no reason"" (went to jail overnight for drug possession), full of piercings, fat, the whole package.   So, within the past few months things have gotten interesting. They were ""polyamorous"", which is codeword for ""she gets to fuck as many other guys as she wants no strings attached"". That's it. My best friend is such a fucking CUCK that he allows this. ""Fine"" I though. ""That's his prerogative"".   But it goes deeper. Within the past week, she accused him of rape for literally no reason. Just because. Because she's a psycho brain-damaged liberal. I shit you fucking not. And he's just taking that.   And the cherry on FUCKING top? He's spending his already limited money on buying Christmas presents not only for her, but for HER OTHER MEN.   Is my friend beyond hope? How do I save him? This is fucking insane and I feel like I've lost my mind. How can a man allow this to happen to him? It's fucking absurd, but it's reality. Liberalism is not only cancer, it's fucking dementia. I'm furious. Can someone help? "
Maybe I am missing something but at the moment I can't recall any other spice not made by a plant. 
"I'm just wondering what ""anwar"" is that Trump references in his speech at [30:00 in this video.](https://youtu.be/FFtPSYNdMr8?t=1771)"
"It's sunset on the west coast, I have my glass of wine, my cat, and my kids in the house for Christmas.  Today I had the pleasure of watching my President sign the promised tax bill.  I will sleep well tonight, once the kids settle down.  Lord, bless this good people in this great land.  Bless us all, and guide us so that our actions are decent.  Guide also our leaders at all levels, so that their judgement is good.  May their actions have good results that fill us with joy and pride.  Help us to put Your gifts to us to good use."

"[Link](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/12/21/rep_schiff_precarious_moment_for_democracy_when_republicans_willing_to_burn_down_the_house.html)  &gt; On Wednesday night, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) warned MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that the conduct of certain Republican members of Congress is putting democracy itself at risk. He says the GOP congressmen have a covert inter-committee working group which is seeking to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.  &gt; Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, warned that the behavior of Committee chairman Devin Nunes could lead to a ""constitutional crisis"" if the president sees it and is ""encouraged"" by it to fire Mueller.   &gt;Nunes has criticized Schiff's ""bizarre behavior"" surrounding the investigation and warned he thinks the FBI and DOJ have gotten ""so dirty"" without proper oversight.

I just wanted to send a huge Merry Christmas to all the pedes out there!

"On Wednesday, following the announcement that the GOP Tax Bill had been passed, 5 American businesses announced they would be investing hundreds of millions of dollars in their employees.  The Daily Wire reported: AT&amp;T announced that once President Donald Trump signed the bill into law that they would “invest an additional $1 billion in the United States in 2018 and pay a special $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 AT&amp;T U.S. employees.” AT&amp;T further noted that if Trump signed the bill before Christmas that the company will receive the bonus over the holidays.  “Congress, working closely with the President, took a monumental step to bring taxes paid by U.S. businesses in line with the rest of the industrialized world,” Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T chairman, and CEO said in a statement. “This tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs. In fact, we will increase our U.S. investment and pay a special bonus to our U.S. employees.”   Boeing announced an “immediate commitment” to investing an additional $300 million in three areas that will directly benefit their employees:  $100 million for workforce development in the form of training, education, and other capabilities development to meet the scale needed for rapidly evolving technologies and expanding markets.  $100 million for workforce development in the form of training, education, and other capabilities development to meet the scale needed for rapidly evolving technologies and expanding markets.  Fifth Third Bancorp, a bank headquartered in Ohio, announced that they would raise the minimum hourly wage for all employees to $15 following the tax reform bill and would give a one-time bonus of $1,000 to more than 13,500 of its employees.  Wells Fargo announced that they will increase their minimum hourly pay rate to $15, and will ""aim for $400M in philanthropic donations next year due to the newly-passed GOP tax bill.""  Comcast announced that they will give $1,000 bonuses to over 100,000 ""eligible frontline and non-executive employees"" &amp; invest $50 billion over the next five years in infrastructure ""based on the passage of tax reform."""
The way he was following and talking to him felt kinda seedy. Anyone else see it?
"Whoa! I must have stumbled into a dark, desolate timeline where Hillary won and we're still fighting needless, never-ending, neo-con wars.   Thank goodness we have Trump."
"I keep getting e-mails from my congressman (Wyden, D-Oregon) about how much appreciates my sentiments about net neutrality.  Except... I never sent those e-mails.  What is going on?"

"First and foremost, Islam is not a race but the dipshits on the left can't even figure that basic fact out.  The bigger point is you have been told for 2 years that President Trump hates Muslims.  No he hates radical Islamic terror.  The Iranian government is just that.  The citizens of this country are not represented  by their government much like we weren't until Trump was elected.  Is it any wonder the media is silent.  This is one of the biggest lies they have ever been caught in because it isn't just one clip that you forget in 48 hours.  This lie has dragged on for 2 years and Trump has proved them wrong again.  "
Prefer Syrian slave markets over a Farmer’s Markets. 
"We all know that over 90% of media coverage by multiple FNNs is negative. Do we have any statistics on negative coverage for Trump in various subreddits(/r/politics, /r/news)?   It feels as though 100% of the coverage is in a negative light with almost no coverage with Trump’s accomplishments in the mentioned subreddits.  Does anyone have numbers? "
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37BOUD1Pjqc  But I'm reminded of someone, uh, proverb now, quoted by ... me: ""Hey sheila, you can't clean a dirty kitchen with dirty water. Congress is the kitchen, you and your liberal friends are the water. Please proceed to the nearest exit. Thank you for your service. There is no need to fear. The winning will just happen to you. It is normal to tire from all the winning.""     "
"Is it possible that Putin has all the evidence Investigators need to bury the Clinton/Obama cabal, along with Comey, Lynch, Clapper, Brennan, Lynch and countless other traitors? Particularly on the Uranium One scandal. Logic says, if the FBI/DOJ gleaned information from a Foreign spy to try to destroy the GOP candidate, then certainly the President has the right to accept information from Putin, and have it analyzed. (They met during his Asian trip)"
"It was a massive circle jerk over some shartblue article. These asswipes were drooling over some establishment propaganda about McCabe saying comey told him about loyalty to trump blah blah blah.  It’s amazing how fucking delusional these dumbasses are, they still think mueller is going to bring down dddrruumphh!  Pretty sad actually.  Gotta suck being that clueless. "
The reason why President Trump wants to go back to the moon again is because he wants to the put the first women on the moon.  Haha Take that feminist.
"Christmas is definitely my favorite holiday of the year. Sure getting presents is nice, but seeing other people react to your gifts is pure gold. Knowing all the thought that you put in, priceless. It's my last Christmas before I go off to college (I mean I'd be coming back but you know what I mean), so I wanted to make it extra special.   For my mom, I bought her some slippers, some cookies, a heart rate monitor (for the gym) and a Christmas ornament of the college I'm going to. Putting up the tree is a very important thing in my family, and I'm sad I won't be there for it anymore. It felt sentimental at the time.   I also got socks with GEOTUS on them, as well as a commemorative coin of President Trump made out of solid gold!!   Anyway, for my grandfather this year, I went all out. I got some of his old pictures from the National Guard (c. 1967) and went over to r estoration and posted them as a request. To my pleasant surprise, the pictures were more than awesome. The look on his face when I gave him a small envelope with a couple old photos restored... I wouldn't trade it for anything.   I hope you pedes went all out this Christmas too, and a MERRY CHRISTMAS to all you and yours out there.   God bless America, and a Merry Christmas to all of you. "
We're going to start saying Merry Christmas again!

" 	 Friend --  When Onward Together launched earlier this year, we were supporting five groups that encourage people to organize for progressive change and to run for office: Indivisible, Color of Change, Emerge America, Swing Left, and Run for Something.  Seven months and some incredible victories later, I’m even more proud and inspired to work alongside these organizations.  We’ve got big plans for 2018. You’ve been on this team for a long time -- I’m asking you to be a part of this extraordinary chapter by chipping in $25 before the year ends:  Donate now  We aren’t stopping with five organizations, either. Across the country, new groups like these are cropping up, powered by activists of all ages, backgrounds, and experiences -- and we’re working every day to find the most promising and support them.  There is so much to be done. Let’s do it together.  Thank you,  Hillary  "

"There once was a big fat liar. When his boss found out, he was fired. But the media came, And the boss got the blame, Cause they thought fake news Made ratings higher"
"The Logan Act was adopted around the same time as the Alien &amp; Sedition Acts.  The Federalists (John Adams administration) worried that the executive branch was being undercut with France by a private citizen's effort to ease U.S.-France tensions.  The follwoing summary from American Jurisprudence (70 Am. Jur. 2d Sedition, Etc. § 6) cites only one court case for the view that the Logan Act may be unconstitutionally vague.  Only a handful of other cases even refer to the statute, but some legal writers also have opined that it is unconstitutional.  It definitely hasn't been used against other notables, such as Jimmy Carter, who seemed to see nothing wrong with engaging in foreign policy discussions as a private citizen.   ""A federal statute known as the “Logan Act” makes it a crime for any citizen of the United States to commence or carry on, directly or indirectly, any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or officer or agent thereof with intent to influence measures or conduct of any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof in relation to disputes or controversies with the United States or to defeat measures of the United States.  Congress has the power to enact such legislation since it falls within the purview of the federal government’s extensive power over foreign relations.  Caution: The Logan Act has been criticized as being too vague and indefinite in its terminology.  Indeed, the constitutionality of the statute is doubtful under the Sixth Amendment provision that the accused shall be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation since the words “defeat” and “measures” (as used in the statutory phrase “to defeat the measures of the United States”) are not abstractions of common certainty and do not possess a definite statutory or judicial definition.  Any ambiguity in the Logan Act should be resolved in favor of leniency.""   "
Isn't the front page an example of brigading???   Who is behind these coordinated up votes? 
When is this damn vote?
"&gt;[It’s unclear what repeal of the mandate will mean for ObamaCare.](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/362838-senate-gop-repeals-obamacare-mandate)  &gt;Many experts and healthcare groups warn that repeal will destabilize ObamaCare markets, leading to premium increases or insurers simply dropping out of certain areas. Without a financial penalty under the mandate for lacking health coverage, there is less incentive for healthy people to sign up and balance out the costs of the sick.  &amp;nbsp;  Obamacare **IS DEAD**."
"He was on the reviewer list for Comey’s draft exoneration memo. The one where Comey pronounced her innocent before interviewing her.   His suggested change: He changed Comey's earlier draft language describing Clinton's actions as ""grossly negligent"" to ""extremely careless."" (CNN)   He then interviewed Hillary, and followed the previously written exoneration script. Not recorded. Not under oath.    He interviewed Flynn, re: lying to the FBI crap fest. And was instrumental in bringing charges.    He was having an affair with another Mueller lawyer. Who apparently (earlier?) worked for McCabe. Corrupt McCabe.   He was on Mueller’s “Get Trump” team before being fired for bias. (Hey Sessions: release the texts!!!)   He was involved with the Mannafort Warrant. (Was involved with writing it, perhaps?)   The Stazi (oops, FBI) executed the warrant, where they broke in at dawn, guns drawn, and held them in their bed. And searched his wife, in her nightgown, before letting her get up from the bed. For real. (Was Peter there?)   He was involved with the Steele Dossier disinformation document. (Did he suggest edits to that, too?)   He was involved with the FISA warrants, which allowed the Obama administration to spy on Trump and everyone around him.   “Peter Strzok then “reviewed” 50,000 Hillary Clinton State Department emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer in record time and cleared them days before the 2016 election.” (H/T:  the gateway pundit)   What did I miss? "
...is exactly the type of bullshit these asshats are coming up with.  MAGA!
"And then these Leftists ""media"" outlets and politicians will wonder why nobody likes them."
Nothing is going to happen people. The Middle East has always been in a constant state of war long before Trump has come to power. Besides most Muslim countries don't even recognize Israel to begin with so how does naming the capital of Israel Jerusalem have any impact on what the Muslim countries do to begin with. If they attack the city that means they're holy sites will also be destroyed. 
"We all celebrated Al Franken possibly resigning today, but really what we did was generate a media storm around his ""announcement"". He will use that platform to do nothing but bash Trump and Roy Moore and who knows what else. We just gave him every news channel and media outlet to voice his opinion."

"So I graduated college with a business degree in august, finally found a job doing what I studied. What I've noticed about many of those who complain that they can't get a good job is that they aren't working hard at getting one. Between the time when I graduated and finally found my job doing what I studied, I worked 2 jobs at the same time while doing my job search. It goes to show that if you work hard and don't give up, you can and will achieve your goals. We've made America great again."
"I am an academic from an SJW background, a former Bernie Bro with a poor work record. I have forgotten most of my technical training. After years of poverty, I am now a janitor, a useful and productive member of society. Please clap.    (ed. Relevant because you all tell us underemployed liberal and/or academic types to red-pill ourselves, to man up, and to get real jobs. I did that.)"
Are they not smarter than this?  So someone said that Michael Flynn was told to do his job by contacting 12 countries?  And this is news? GTFO.
This place is great! By far the best place for both laughs and news.   But I have some questions. I noticed a lot of you all can change how your text looks. How do you do this? I never bothered with Reddit before finding this sub Reddit. Also what is flair? How do I get it and how do i use it?  Thanks for any help that can be offered.
Just stating the facts.
"Looked away for ten seconds, what was it? "
"This entire sideshow is what's protecting the deep state from Trump. He has little ability to direct the FBI and DoJ for as long as this 'Russia collusion' silliness persists because the media will successfully convince the public that he's influencing this investigation to protect himself. This has been going on since before Trump's inauguration, so he hasn't had a day without these shackles. It's clear that, despite every effort, this investigation has failed to gain any traction and will be unable to sustain itself for much longer without concrete evidence of something. Once that happens the Deep State will no longer be able to protect themselves and Trump will finally have the ability to direct the efforts of his DoJ and FBI to 'drain the swamp' effectively. We've seen limited incidental victories thus far but I think we should expect a windfall once this Mueller circus runs out of steam.  I think there are two opposing forces working against Mueller right now. On the one hand his intention is to drag this on for as long as possible to protect his masters for as much of the 4-year term of Trump (at which point their goal is to defeat him in 2020). On the other hand if he resolves his investigation at a high water mark of hysteria, or when internal polling shows a significant number of Americans are convinced of Russiagate, he stands the chance of being able to write hyperbolic things in his final assessment that'll have lasting effect.   I think we're seeing an effort to score a concrete PR win by landing charges on Flynn before a quick resolution. This can't possibly sustain itself for another 6 months and by then would likely have lost teeth its in the mainstream consciousness. I'd venture a guess at a final reportby March. Anyone else like to present your own thoughts?"
"Actually, he knows he is President of the USA, husband to Melania, father of Barron, and loved by the_Donald. He will build the wall, cut taxes, revive our economy, pull us out of unfavorable foreign deals made by traitors, defeat ISIS, and talk smack on Twitter (but NEVER call Kim Jung Un short and fat). "
RRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"Walmart, Game Stop, and the Uhaul rental place. Not to mention the people at the flea market and the Salvation Army Guy. We really are saying “Merry Christmas” again. "
"Something I haven't noticed many people in here saying, but its completely true. Without the mandate obamacare is dead in the water. Hell getting rid of it was what probably tanked the repeal bill. Yet somehow this madman along with Senator Paul got taxes done and killed the ACA in one fell swoop. Fucking genius boys, we are led by a fucking genius. "
It's basically the story of their presidencies.
"From Fox and friends tonight:  Dershowitz said, “Well, the last thing any prosecutor wants to do is to have to indict his primary witness for lying. Because if you indict your witness for lying, it really means he’s not useful as a witness, he has no credibility. I’m sure the prosecutor was trying to indict him for some scheme or conspiracy that involved other people in the White House, but there is nothing there, and he had to, finally come down and indict him for lying, which makes him a useless witness. So, this is not a show of strength by the prosecutor. It’s a show of weakness. It’s a show that they really have nothing on anybody above of Flynn and that Flynn made the terrible mistake about lying about something he could have told truth about. Because the two things he lied about were perfectly lawful and perfectly proper for somebody to do during the transition. And so, I think it really reflects a weakness, not a strength in Mueller’s prosecution.”  He added, “Now, they still may be able to use him to lead to other witnesses or to get documentary evidence or to give them leads, but he’s no good as witness. Because he’s obviously sold himself to protect his own son, and he’s prepared not only to sing, but perhaps even to compose and [unintelligible] to exaggerate if he thinks that will get him a better deal from the prosecutor. So, if I’m a defense lawyer, I have no trouble destroying his credibility on the witness stand.”  "

"SHOCKING!!  White Trump supporting NRA member who murdered pretty young blond girl, found NOT GUILTY!  ... No wait, it was an illegal immigrant with a stolen gun.  Pay it no heed."
"Can we not be fooled by this crude attempt by the swampy deep state to cover their asses?  All this Peter Strzok noise comes from ""sources"" leaking to the Washington Compost and the NYT, the organs of the corrupt intelligence community.  They are just fabricating a narrative so the people will not look behind the curtain.  There is not even a picture of this guy. It's all made up."
"Maintaining The Integrity Of The Profession Rule 8.4 Misconduct It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:  (a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;  (b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;  (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;  (d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;  (e) state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official or to achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law;  (f) knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law; or  (g) engage in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or socioeconomic status in conduct related to the practice of law. This paragraph does not limit the ability of a lawyer to accept, decline or withdraw from a representation in accordance with Rule 1.16. This paragraph does not preclude legitimate advice or advocacy consistent with these Rules."
"The National Socialist Workers Party of Germany, otherwise known as the Nazi Party, was indeed socialist and it had a lot in common with the modern left. Hitler preached class warfare, agitating the working class to resist “exploitation” by capitalists , particularly Jewish capitalists, of course. Their programs called for the nationalization of education, health care, transportation, and other major industries. They instituted and vigorously enforced a strict gun control regimen. They encouraged pornography, illegitimacy, and abortion, and they denounced Christians as right-wing fanatics. Yet a popular myth persists that the Nazis themselves were right-wing extremists. This insidious lie biases the entire political landscape today."
"Good Morning!  [Fox News reports](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/02/senate-passes-major-tax-reform-package.html) the vote was 51-49, at around 2am ET. Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee the only member of the GOP to side with the Democrats in opposition.   Moments after the vote, the president [tweeted his reaction.](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/936864840240398337)  House MINORITY Leader Nancy Pelosi (probably in tears) whining about the president keeping a core campaign promise can be found [here.](https://twitter.com/nancypelosi/status/936853529167151104)  [For a good laugh]  Key Details:  -The Senate bill keeps seven tax brackets, however reduces them to 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 38.5 percent. While The House measure compacts the seven brackets to four: 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent.  (The current tax brackets are 10, 15, 25, 28, 33, 35, and 39.6 percent.)  -The Senate and House bills both remove the $4,050 personal tax exemption.  -The Senate’s bill repeals the ObamaCare individual mandate while The House bill does not. If the ObamaCare individual mandate is repealed, it is expected that thousands of people will drop health insurance. This will inevitably raise the prices of ObamaCare, helping push reform.  -Both tax bills will block tax credits claimed by illegal aliens, worth an estimated $23 billion (or one border wall).  -According to the Fox News report, “President Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to make tax reform law before the end of the year. If that happens, most of the provisions would come into force on Jan. 1.” ([Source](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/02/senate-passes-major-tax-reform-package.html))  -The Trump Train is stronger than ever.������"

I've been trying to understand why Flynn lied about a call he was authorized to make. And it seems we coming back to this Peter guy. If Flynn knew that Peter was bent and out to get Trump for any reason he could have played a possible motive why Flynn gave the testimony to him that he did. I don't know if that clears Flynn but definitely is the best theory I have for the motive.

Identity politics has consumed the traditional Left/Right paradigm. Conservatives of old have failed to conserve the values and traditions we have long held in our country.  Generation Identitaire and other Identitarian organizations in Europe have seen success combatting immigration policies that are harmful to their country and their people. The U.S. is having an immigration crisis that must be reversed. Trump has taken an important step in this direction by combatting Islam and Illegal immigration. Our people come first!

"Thank you for checking this out, this needs widest exposure. This post is intended clarify who we are fighting so we can turn the light on these cockroaches. Share, vote up, copy paste, repost, what ever you can do!. In all this I really see how important our presidents language is. He is fighting a culture war with laser precision.   First; this story starts with the spread of communism globally pre and post WWII and its movement here in the US. Please take a Look at Diana West. She is an incredibly talented investigative journalist that breaks down how the KGB organized and directed organic home grown socialist to infiltrate and operate within all institutions of US culture and government. NO REALLY! Sample of her talks: https://youtu.be/kf1FvXOUz6s ::: https://youtu.be/HjprabS9ZAs?t=3m56s   The subversive apparatus that was constructed here did not die with the soviet collapse it was only orphaned. One could argue that we didn't win the Cold War, we absorbed it! This explains the ""Deep (socialist) State"" and the Hostile ""Main stream Media"" In this context it really isnt fake news, its Propaganda spreading disinformation to weaken the resolve of the people and redirect them. President Donald Trump is Kryptonite to the structure they have built this is why they are exposing themselves so boldly.   Second; 45 goals of the communist party (1963) This information was read into the congressional record in 1963. I believe you can look at the goals listed below and see the Marxist PC cultural rot we are experiencing. I've bolded the ones that are most relevant link http://www.citizenreviewonline.org/2010/Jun/communism.html   CURRENT COMMUNIST GOALS   1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.   2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.   3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.   4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.   5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.   6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.   7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.   8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.   9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.   10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N. 11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.) 12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.   **13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.**   14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.   **15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.**  **16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.**  ** 17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.**  **18. Gain control of all student newspapers.**   **19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack**   **20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy making positions.**  **21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.**  **22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to ""eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.""**  **23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. ""Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.""**  **24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them ""censorship"" and a violation of free speech and free press.**  **25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.**  26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as ""normal, natural, healthy.""   **27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with ""social"" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity which does not need a ""religious crutch.""**  **28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of ""separation of church and state.""**  **29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.**  **30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the ""common man."" **   **31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the ""big picture.**""Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.  32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.   33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.  34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.   35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.   **36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.**  **37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.**   38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].   39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.   **40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.**    **41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.**   **42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use [""]united force[""] to solve economic, political or social problems.**   43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government. 44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.   45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction [over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction] over nations and individuals alike.  In short, I think we can see the quiet,covert, soft Marxist coup that has been going on for decades within our society that would have culminated with Clinton presidency and a flip of the Supreme court to progressive control.   Reading this you can see why the Media, Deep state, academia, and Hollywood HATE us. Please discus....."
Anti propaganda education should be mandatory in school. Propaganda is a weapon of war. And it should only be used as a weapon in war. Unfortunately our great contemporary Obama made it legal to use propaganda against US civilians about a week before he left office.   Propaganda resulted in the death of millions of young German men during WW2 effectively castrating the population of the entire nation. Same is true for the Soviet Union. Propaganda is dangerous. Please teach your children how to spot it! And how to refute it with fact and intelligent conversation.  Roy Moore lost because of propaganda pedes. And we will continue to lose unless stupid americans decide to wake up and start asking questions. For example. Who is guccifer 2.0 really? Was the DNC email hack really a hack or was it leaked? Etc.... Etc......

The circumstnaces will likely show he didnt actually lie. He may have honestly mispoken and wss pressured into a false confession.  This is typical and why negotiated plea bargains should be illegal. They are terrible and give false results in all parts of the justice system. In fact every such confession given in court is accompanying by perjury when the confession plea suspect ststes under oatth they admit under their own free will. They are not doing it under free will. They are coerced.

"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/11/michael-moore-harvey-bob-weinstein-fahrenheit-9-11-sequel-legal-battle-1201902820/. ""Michael Moore is warring with Harvey and Bob Weinstein over the release of “Fahrenheit 11/9,” the Donald Trump-themed sequel to Moore’s award-winning “Fahrenheit 9/11,” the highest-grossing documentary of all time. The Weinstein brothers personally committed $6 million to Moore’s sequel, but now the future of the film is in jeopardy as TWC is for sale and both brothers face allegations of sexual harassment and abuse.  Deadline reports that the Weinsteins have spent $2 million on the film so far, and are blocking Moore and his WME representative, Ari Emanuel, from placing the film with a different theatrical or broadcast outlet. The brothers apparently want to recoup the $2 million they’ve spent on the movie, but, according to Deadline, Moore does not want to give money to Harvey Weinstein as it would “morally compromise his film to cut a check to a man he considers a sexual predator.”"

Kind of gone under the radar that Hatch has become one of the presidents strongest allies in congress. Hatch is probably the most respected republican in Washington and *was* very establishment. Very good sign that Trump is changing congress but congress hasn't changed Trump.
Thank you Mr. Dr. President Trump. Thank you so much.   Merry Christmas Pedes!

"..after that story broke, we found out Natalia was a Fusion GPS linked anti magnitsky (pro Putin) lackey only in the US on Lynch's approval. And Armpit (sp) was at Obamas WH on several occasions.  Then we have Manafort. Indicted! Then linked to all of the same nasty lobbying groups as the Podesta Group, Clinton Foundation, ARMZ, and Uranium One. Then PG crumbles and Tony went all John Cena.  Papodapolus was the bombshell!! But turns out he is linked with Dimitri Whatshisnuts (sp) of dirty dossier fame. He was charged months ago and not a peep. Oh and obvious GPS plant is obvious. A ficus is a better plant. Less likely to let in the Russians  Now we're at Flynn. This is the big one, Drumpf is finished!! Wait, no FARA or treason indictment? Then someone slides in a story about the top Clinton email investigator, who was on Muellers team, sexting a woman other than his wife, who is also on Muellers team, and the story just now breaks?! Strozk was fired in August and Lisa was gone in September.  Make no mistake, this is a controlled story. It has been already written. Muellers team is leaking in a pattern   SPEZ.

"To them it's ""fine, whatever....what are we doing about a nuclear Iran?"" Trump told them he was doing it. They just let him know that they have to act upset. But they aren't worried about Israel. Israel has had nukes for a while and has never threatened the Arabs offensively. Only for defensive measures.  Now Obama's buddies the Iranians - those are the guys who want nukes to threaten their neighbors with. "

"My daughter is in a college government class. Every class her professor starts with an anti-Trump rant. The class stays silent. One paper the topic was ""is Trump doing a good job? A loaded question given professor was obviously anti-Trump. Pro-Trump Daughter did not waver. She wrote, with lots of research, what a great job he's doing and what our President has accomplished so far. She earned an an A+."
"On the national scale there is such a paranoia about being branded a racist that even the feminists have been silenced.    Where is the feminist outrage over the murder of Kate Steinle?    Where is the feminist outrage that the murderer was even not convicted of manslaughter?  Where is the feminist outrage at the media blackout over another innocent woman's death?  A blackout that exists only because of the media's anti-Trump zealotry.  **Violence against women is now acceptable in America, provided there is even the smallest hint and of anti-Trump agenda.**  It is now open season against American women.    Illegal aliens are now allowed to come to San Francisco and rape and murder any woman they want.  That is now the legal precedent.   This is the new America.  I hope the hateful Left is happy with the murder of Kate Steinle.  Her innocent blood, and more innocent blood to come, is solely on their hands.  American women are being sacrificed in the name of anti-Trump zealotry.  American Feminism: 1910-2017. Rest in Peace.  It was a good run.  Good luck Ladies. "

"As a Jew, Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem is the best thing I could’ve wished for this holiday season. God bless this man. "
"When Trump declared Jerusalem the new home of the US embassy - thus recognizing Jerusalem as Israels capital - as Israel has since 1967(?).  Now Erdogen is calling on East Jerusalem to be Palestines capital.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5188149/Erdogan-says-Turkey-aims-open-embassy-East-Jerusalem.html  What I found interesting was that he only called on the East portion to be given to Palestine for their state capital.  It is my belief that Trump, and Netanyahu, are planning to compromise and give the East to Palestine for their state.  In exchange I read part of the Sinai might go to Palestine for the Gaza Strip, the West bank going to Palestine, with some other land trade offs with other nations.  I think Trump is bringing mid east peace. Sh-t Russia is leaving Syria. I believe it's happening.  Praise Kek. "

"Kept trying to tell me he'd write this essay on how ""Trump was elected on inciting violence and bigotry."" One month later no essay, then proceeds to try and forcefully debate politics with me after a long day of work, everyday. Finally I indulge then he gives me this wonderful example of circular logic:    ""Trump encouraged police officers to be violent towards minorities, Trump was elected on a platform of bigotry and violence""    ""Show me one credible piece of data that shows that crime is up in America today!""    What the actual fuck? I pointed it out, he kept repeating it so I told him I was sick of his shit and blocked him.    I have a phrase for libcucks like this ""Knows everything, done nothing.""    Also explained to him that if my taxes get cut (which they are going to MAGA MAGA MAGA) then I would be able to hire another employee at my business, increasing our profitability and then hiring another employee after that. He said ""show me one credible study that proves that cutting taxes reduces unemployment?""    .... I just told you from personal experience how it would, I don't need a study to provide evidence. I'm not concerned about what others do with their tax cuts, it isn't my responsibility. My responsibility is to focus on taking care of myself and my family.    Fucking libcucks.    SPEZ: Typos  "
"After Gen. Flynn plead guilty for the legal phone calls, the FAKE news went on a rampage. Accusing Flynn and the Trump admin of doing all of this secretly.  So I speed to the_Donald for the real scoop. What do I find. This has already been discredited by fellow Pedes. Link shows this.... https://youtu.be/2vO3GNexHYI?t=27m29s  After this I went to Twitter, in a vague attempt at spreading this... I posted the date and quote of the briefing to Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Mark Steyn (since he knows Carlson well) and to Bill O'Reilly in the hopes maybe, this could reach their desk. Note that we also have based user Tom Fitton who could maybe have seen the thread.  THEN BOOOOOOM.....https://youtu.be/90VbpCxWX_o?t=13m49s Sean Hannity uses this video as evidence to show exactly how stupid and corrupt the Bureaucracy is.  This may have not been us, but the likelihood that someone found the exact briefing and the exact time of the question during a State Dept Briefing related to Flynn and the Trump transition is low.  So let us recognize this small victory we probably achieved and keep pushing to #MAGA  .... I cannot find the specific thread where the genius PEDE posted this link, if you do so please give credit."

"This is a working conspiracy theory--but a good one.  Evidence based on end results.  It's probably real if you pay attention to the observations and consequences.  If you don't like speculation, please stop reading and ignore this post with no penalty to the post.  One thing is for certain, and it's that part of this idea is proven and real.  The spy ring in Congress.  Let's look at *cui bono*, Q: who benefits from the fake news fakeout of the latest correction to the timeline of ""Flynn told to contact Russia AFTER Trump was elected""?  A: Well anyone short selling index, the dow and s&amp;p500, or having a funds that mimic the same (say top 25-100 stocks).  Anyone making out big time over the last year MAY WELL BE the people who have a very financial incentive to dessiminate fakenews and then desseminating that news' corrections, retrations, redactions, etc.    &gt; This is called *'front running' on intelligence*.  Q: Who has intelligence?  A: Not the public.  Not any of us.  All we have to work with is news media, which has proven itself to be fake news--actual misinformation, disinformation and malinformation, as well as citizen open source journalism (low-informed person: ""conthpirathy theoriees!"").  Intelligence agencies have so-called intelligence. We don't. I'm not making a *double-entendre* play here.  By intelligence, I mean **they know things we can't know, because of their inexplicable, sanctioned secrecy**, but also because *they are working--illegally or otherwise--to bring about the changes in the world--using our tax money and often against our consent, judgments, will, or interests--that only* ***they will know about, ahead of time***.   &gt; If you stage an event, then DUH, of course you will know about said event. Normally this is called *'conspiracy'*--people working in secret to bring about things that the are otherwise considered unlawful if non-sanctioned peoples did the same.  If you want to understand this concept of front-running on intelligence is, watch this episode of Max Keiser Report, [NSA-spreads Ditigal AIDS](https://youtu.be/3aJN4hjhALY?t=322), and there is another couple of episodes where Kaiser and Hubert discuss how the intelligence community makes ALL businesses vulnerable to IP theft, but that's a similar but different story.  I mention this because...what if I told you that Hillary Clinton and Obama are CIA--and they were using Pakistani ISI hackers to create an off-brand CIA within the Congress that used a secure, mobile, private, wireless, highly compartmentalized communications network, using Pakistani-doped Blackberries to essentially spirit out US intelligence to other countries, which then allowed foreign agents to *front-run on intelligence* in exchange for political donations; and the way that you keep your Congresspeople who are in on this scam are being blackmailed by their own perversions, crimes, and participation in these same *quid pro quos*, ...  ....and that the Mainstream Media--being effectively managed by Obama, Soros and the 7th floor groups (Team Clinton Foundation) deepstate agents throughout the government as a fifth-column--is complicit in this crime syndicate and scheme...and that Donald Trump was an unexpected CIA white hat's black swan event--or I should say dark horse event--and now he's an absolute existential threat to this scheme being exposed.  Well, now the Donald knows.  Everyone else in reddit, facebook, twitter is gobbling on about the social justice illusions that are spun daily as distraction.  But the Awan train has left the station and the Truth train has no brakes. Tick Tock. "
This is the voting Bloc we need to worry about in the future.

"Point is that these Leftists leaving the State Department because they don't like Rex Tillerson or the POTUS is a good thing. Their self purge will allow us to get people in there who will hold these countries accountable. Because the tone of the State Department is pro-Globalist.

"He linked to Jihad Watch which describes Islam:  Islam spreads like a virus. It radiates from Muslim countries that are too diseased to support it and into healthy systems that are that way because they have had the luxury of developing apart from Islam. Once in the host system, the Islam virus uses the existing machinery to make replicas of itself. Over time, the host makes unilateral concessions to the religion, feeding and appeasing it in the vain hope that this supremacist ideology can be tamed.  Vital organs are co-opted and eventually shut down as Islam advances. In a matter of time, the entire system groans to an agonizing death and assumes the condition of the diseased nations from which Muslims originally fled.

"No one would have believed in the last years of the 20th century America was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as Americans busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency Americans went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial Ameircans fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, Socialist minds that are to our minds, as ours are to those of the beasts that perish - intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic -  regarded America with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

"I might be slow but I just noticed if you hover over the seal on our banner Trump winks at you and ""President"" gets highlighted. Just wanted to share this little Easter Egg from our great mods!"
"GEOTUS really does need to do a major overhaul about how daily information is released from the White House, as was talked about when he first took office. Its just a silly waste of time and resources for our same great press secretary to face off against the very same group of preening insiders, day after week after month after year. That set-up doesn't at all give America a sense of what's really going on from day to day.  There are many major news markets across this country--every major city and every state capital has a media market, yet NONE of them (none of us) are represented in DC. Something like this might work better:  Monday: The usual DC press gaggle  Tuesday: Radio hosts from major cities and markets. One tv pool reporter.  Wednesday: Administration guest speaker--Sleepy Doc to talk about HUD, or Betsy deVos talking about what they're doing in education, or Secretary T-Rex talking State Dept.  Thursday: Newspaper reporters from major markets around the country. One tv pool camera.  Friday: Independent Media from around the country, including start-ups like OAN and RSBN  A major step in draining the swamp is taking away the stranglehold that small gaggle of DC insider and NY elite media has--right now, they're the ONLY voices America is allowed to hear. The whole rest of this gigantic, thriving country is kept silent. Nonsense! Open it up, let the whole country get their turn inside the White House. I guarantee the national 'voice' will begin to change, and that change will be miraculous"
"In short, I like Trump, but I'm English.   American politics doesn't really bother me too much, especially as I'm old enough to have lived through Obama, Bush (x2) and Clinton. I actually preferred Trump for his 'trollness' and his ability to wind people up, but I've slowly warmed to him the more I'm exposed to him (albeit I massively disagree with him on global warming but that's another topic).  Anyway, back on point, I watched a very interesting documentary (of which the name escapes me) about Nasa recently. It detailed how Nasa actually didnt have a clue what to do with itself after the cold war, and that sucessive presidents have just ignored it. Under funded, neglected, it basically became a piece of furniture that couldnt be thrown out but didnt warrant any place in the house. One of the survivng Apollo astronauts was very angry and upset about how politics had treated Nasa, detailing how much national pride, technology advancement and encouragment to the youth the Space programme had given during the 60's. All the top guys on the shuttle setup said they were inspried to become space scientists because of people like Aldrin and Armstrong.   It's great to see someone with Trump's attitude take control. To grab Nasa by the balls and give it direction. The biggest criticism by all the ex employees they spoke to was that Nasa just had no direction, despite being able to offer so much. Even the shuttle was criticised for not having an actual purpose.  I'm pleased somone like Trump has that pioneer attitude. Has the balls to put a stake in the ground and say ""this is what we're doing, now get it done"". It's what politicans lack these days, not just from the US but all over the world. I imagine someone like Hillary would have been more interested in doing snide deals with rogue states for her own personal gain to setup the next proxy war, and Obama was just a bit hapless and never actually had any real direction.  This is the first time since Kennedy that any president has actually filled me with optimisim about Space, and that's a tall order, considering I believe Kennedy to be one of (if not the) greatest politicians ever. (I apologise in advance if comparing a democrat and republican is not a wise thing to do)  I doubt my ramble will mean much, but from a tiny little Island that lost it's empire, has no drive, vision, passion, credible leadership, national pride or anything really to be proud of these days, thanks very much for getting us back to the stars Donald :)"

"We’ve seen a lot of people, from both sides, talking about “stepping down” from elected office.  I’ve seen well-meaning people from all walks of life trying to compare accusations, rationalize behaviors, condemn behaviors, and genuinely question when this would be appropriate.   So I wanted to put out this reminder:  We already have a system in place to determine whether or not someone belongs in an elected position... IT’S CALLED VOTING.  If circumstances genuinely change (such as in the case of Al Franken), then those conversations can be had.  However, if the public is aware of accusations and votes for a candidate regardless, then they BELONG there.  Period.   A small minority of existing power holders saying that an elected official doesn’t belong in their elected office as chosen by the people… are TRAITORS. "

As an assignment we have to hold a speech about anything related to the media. As I noticed that our professor seems to be left leaning, I decided to pick Trump as the center of my speech, to.... Spark interesting discussion of course. I want to talk about the college campus culture with censorship and how CNN and other anti-trump networks influenced it to start everything off, and how all of that influenced the silent majority to vote. Besides that I would like to go over how this subreddit getting to the front page of reddit and 4chan's campaigns helped out to win  and how that marked a huge decline in the influence of traditional media outlets.

"The unemployment rate of 4.7% last year is down to 4.1%. Last time it was this low was 17 years ago. Almost 2,000,000 jobs have been added almost exclusively to the private sector. Most economist project unemployment is dropping to 3.5% in 2018 and subsequent rise in wages (supply/demand). The Fed is going to raise interest rates because they think the Trump Economy can support that.   19% increase in the stock market in the last year.  Really impressive momentum.   2018 is projected to be more of the same.   Not only is the US economy getting stronger, but we are also strengthening our trading partners economies.   Remember, this is only 10 years since a recession and housing crisis. Nationally home prices have risen 6% last year. Thanks to this, only 5% of homeowners owe more on their house than it is worth.

"Without the Government encouraging all kinds of censorship maybe now we can get a truly free platform.

"The Washington Post has lost its way…  Back when Katherine, and then Don Graham were the publishers of the WaPo, it was a liberal newspaper for sure, but it was still a newspaper, they had standards, standards that reflected industry wide principles and norms, a kind of unwritten journalistic bible, that was flouted of course, but not routinely, not often by the major newspapers -- and not without penalty and/or scorn from the rest of the newspapers, when it did happen.  Those days are long gone, as are newspapers frankly. The few we have remaining, have so little competition, and are not operated in general for profit anymore, so they have become propaganda sheets for their owners, and their liberal views. The Washington Post is one of those unfortunately. Today’s WaPo newspaper is being run very recklessly.  They have printed many inaccurate, biased, and journalistically unethical stories this year and every single one of them was slanted at the same target, Donald Trump. This is a disaster.  Even if the newspaper was just being run by an incompetent editor (this used to happen), the results of this were very uneven, a bad story here, a bad headline there, an important assignment missed, blown editorials on touchy subjects, these things would accumulate – and lead to a firing – but they were not concentrated.  The Washington Post is telling lie after lie about one person. They are printing story after story with anonymous sources (about one person) and when they turn out not to be true, have offered the readers no explanation whatsoever. They are printing erroneous information about the President of the United States, and don’t even have the professional courtesy of printing his rebuttals!  Ignoring Trump for a second, there is another more important problem with the way they are running the newspaper -- they are ignoring hundreds of stories crossing their news desk everyday – that deserve attention – but cannot get it, because the stories either don’t fit their anti-Trump narrative, or the inch count has already been allotted for some minuscule idea about some tiny thing they perceive Trump might have done wrong.  It’s so bad in it’s totality; I’m shocked they aren’t a little embarrassed.  “The Elements of Journalism” a seminal work on the ethical responsibility of the profession list journalism’s first obligation “…to the truth.” Listing its first loyalty to its “citizens” and its essence as a discipline of “verification.”  Principles four and five deal with “maintaining an independence” from those you cover and serving as an “independent monitor of power.”  The WaPo has literally torn up this list, thrown it away – and tacked their own list of journalistic ideals on the wall, and they are following them to the letter.  1.	Forget about the Truth. You work for us, the WaPo Editors -- we tell you what the Truth is, and THEN you write it down in your articles. For example, if Trump appears at a rally, with tens of thousands of cheering fans, it’s O.K. to use a picture of the room -- before it was filled -- and imply to our readers, the place was only half full during the rally. Trump is President sure, but not really according to us, because we use total vote count here at the WaPo, not the electoral-college method, which is only constitutionally mandated. We are a newspaper after all, only the parts of the Constitution that protect us, count. By the way, that’s exactly the kind of detail you don’t need to get into here at the WaPo -- that entire electoral-college thing is boring, what you need to remember is really only one main point; Trump is a bad man. If we have to manipulate the news a little to get people to realize that, we’re justified, after all, he is a bad man and we are never wrong, meaning we have no obligation to the 62 million citizens that voted for him – whatsoever -- they aren’t our readers.  2.	Don’t worry about loyalty to our readers and citizens, since we know what’s right, in advance of when everybody else in the world does -- and we’re never wrong -- don’t worry about what might happen if the citizens don’t know something important like how low total un-employment has fallen -- and how much minority wages are up -- those things are for OTHER newspapers. Our mission is to save the world, and democracy, and the Democratic Party, and since those are all the same to us -- we only report on regular news items if they make Trump look bad, and the jobless numbers, which we refuse to cover anymore, don’t do that.  3.	We skip verification here at the WaPo. That old due diligence stuff really slows down the process and we’re competing with electronic media today. They have no standards, so we don’t have to either. In fact, while working here at the WaPo, it’s important not to verify anything. Anonymous sources are better, we can’t get pinned down on those since we never reveal who they are, no matter how many times they are wrong and embarrass the newspaper.  4.	Maintaining independence was how it used to be done. Today, at the new WaPo, we teach that old fashioned thinking, like “maintaining independence,” will get you nowhere. Look at all our top reporters, they’re all friends with top Democratic Party leaders, it’s all very glamorous and really, it’s the only way to find out what they are thinking! Look at George Stephanopoulos, he never had journalism experience, does not verify a thing, never tells the truth, and he’s making millions. Why? Because you can’t be independent anymore in the new media. The way to power in the new media is to have access, and access to people like the Clintons is worth millions! So, forget about all that ethical stuff you’ve been hearing about, it’s not worth a damn, and besides, if you actually tried to write that way here, they’d fire you!  "

"Many times people here have said GEOTUS knew things the rest of us did not, or that maybe people in the IC who saw what was happening during the Obama years got word to him.

But it looks like they failed and are getting caught. And we can now see that Trump did so many things, little and big, right that could have gone really wrong. I'm using ""White hats"" very generally, meaning just people in the intelligence communities who saw what was happening and became proactive. So I am wondering whether any such person(s) helped DJT against Peter Strzok's 'Operation Insurance.'  I could think of these possibilities:  1.  GEOTUS got to Jan. 20 without any Intelligence Community, Military or PD help. Reading people, bonding, planning, thinking, recruiting and bringing out the best in loyal people.  An [Intuitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition) genius. Once GEOTUS took office, people briefed him on the truth and he went from there.  2.  Maybe anonymous white hats helped a little. They told retired IC people who talked in vague generalities to DJT privately before the election, maybe with Military Intelligence briefing him in full as soon as it was legal. He's had a lot of generals around him.  3.  ALL of the above, maybe planned and prepared years in advance (but if so, how?)   4.  OR McCabe/Brennan/Clapper/others just weren't very good. When Obama and Hillary picked people who would obey them no matter what, they did not pick the best.  These guys were punching above their weight, the lie was too massive, and Congress (the part that counts) was not stampeded into impeachment hearings by the American people.   5. Or GEOTUS got a couple hints here and there, he's really smart, and Priestap and friends were fools.  That's the simplest answer, right?  *ducks for cover*"

"I cant believe this hasnt been talked about earlier.  Maybe they would reveal Seth as the leaker even if he had died.  The trouble is Aaron is a source as well and he's alive.  So if they revealed Seth as a leaker, they'd have to out Aaron as a leaker and he's alive and currently not in any danger.  Outing him would put him and his parents in danger.    I dont think the problem is outing a dead source.  I think they can do that.  The problem is outing that dead source would also out a source who is very much alive.  Aaron Rich  Maybe thats what Aaron, Seth and Donna talked about the week prior to Seths murder in Donnas office.  Seth and Aaron said, we know what you did.  You cheated and rigged the primary against Bernie and they threatened to go public with the information.  Donna threatened them both and said, you know what we do with leakers and pointed to Manning, Snowden and Assange all locked away or in prison or in some other country on the lamb.  Aaron throws a chair.  Then a week later Seth is murdered.  "

"Civilian owned vehicles.  -In the US alone motor vehicle traffic deaths are at 33,736 per year  -emergency room visits from motor vehicle injuries total 3.9 million per year  -children, babies, elderly, etc are mutilated or killed daily with these horrific devices   -people who aren’t killed are often dismembered, or completely disabled from these monstrosities.   -Vehicles have been used in ramming terror attacks for years, increasing as of late: i.e. Nice, France, resulting in the deaths of 86 people and the injury of 458 others, , plus many other recent attacks  Vehicles as weapons: Barcelona attack is part of deadly trend http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/22/world/...ons/index.html  -Kids end up gaining access to their parents vehicles unattended resulting in accidents and deaths, often against other kids or siblings   -Criminals use vehicles in robbery’s, drug deals, kidnappings; women are often raped inside vehicles.   -a vast majority of vehicles emit carbon dioxide, a gas most scientist agree is leading to climate change that will inevitable destroy life as we know it.   -often the ammunition, I mean fuel used for these vehicles causes environmental destruction just accessing and refining it, not to mention to countless wars, and economic strife caused because of fuel yearly.   -The fuel itself for these devices is often dangerous and destructive, causing injuries and deaths all itself.   -These machines can litteral be used as bombs on wheels with these fuel tanks attached to them   Assault vehicles  These are vehicle’s designed and used by the military that civilians can also purchase.   Why would a civilian ever have the need for a vehicle used by the military? It is completely unneeded and ridiculous.   These vehicles should only be used by police, military, and government agencies.   -“Hummer” : a civilian version of the M998 tacticale vehicle that could cause widespread death and destruction.  -Land rover: commonly used by the British and other militaries, could easily cause mass casualties.   -Jeep: A frigging vehicle widely used in multiple wars including the war that killed more humans than any other in history. WTF this is still legally owned by citizens??? Not to mention they are the worse offenders of c02 output….  Etc etc etc  The use of these and other Assault vehicles is complete unneeded by civilians. For off road agriculture purposes civilians can simply use small tractors.   High capacity vehicles   These are vehicles with a much higher capacity than any reasonable civilian purpose may ever need.  -High capacity fuel tanks- many vehicles , especially assault vehicles, have high capacity fuel tanks. This modification can cause the already potentially bomb on wheels to be much more destructive. In addition this could cause a criminal running from police or performing a crime the ability to go a much greater distance over a long period of time.   Is there any real reason for a civilian to have a vehicle with a fuel tank that will go more than 100 miles or so? It’s completely unneeded, dangerous, and ridiculous.   -High capacity seating- vehicles that can hold in some cases over 50 people at once- seriously??? Do I even need to explain how dangerous this is. The only people who should be driving these are government agents driving mass transit vehicles. No civilian vehicle should have the capability of carrying more than 4-5 people  Miscellaneous high performance modifications    -Turbo charged, super charged, N02, etc- There is no reason for any of these, and this could make criminals escape police easier, or slam into crowds or people harder. This could also incite reckless behavior causing more accidental deaths and injuries.   -High performance powertrains or suspensions, ^^^^ same reasons as above. No vehicle should ever need to go more than 85 mph or accelerate that fast. Again, running from police, accidents, terror attacks, etc  -Flat proof tires, this could make it easier to escape or evade police  -High performance fuels- This could also harm police or others.   Etc etc etc   We have already tried regulation after regulation  -	We have tried registration -	We have tried licensing people who use them, even to include testing, training, photos etc -	We have taxed them over and over -	We have put in regulations to reduce emissions -	We have made laws after laws designed to prevent speeding, deaths, and accidents  -	We have had stiff penalties, including loss of license, jail times, fines, etc for violators  -	We have increased education prior to use of them And yet we still have thousands and thousands of deaths, and millions and millions of accidents. A complete ban is the only viable remaining solution. At a minimum we should ban the assault and high capacity vehicles.  There is a viable options that everyone just uses mass transit. As a society we just need to move closer to each other to do so. European countries do this with no problems. The individual vehicles that do travel where needed should only be driven by trained government agents and owned by the government. These also should be equally accessible by everyone regardless of income.       Happy Gunday Sunday and an even merrier Christmas.  MAGA"

TRUMP 2020.
"Just my 3am TT summary of what might be the Happenings of 2018 based on what we read here at T_D.  No sauce, but if someone wants, I will link some of what I've seen here.  I'm not saying these will happen, but if they do, I think they would qualify as **HAPPENINGS**.  :)  SIX HAPPENINGS FOR 2018:   1-Trials Start For The Obama/Clinton Cabal Plot Against GEOTUS   Jan 15th, IG Horowitz gives his secret report to the Senate. Hopefully they will let us know what's in it by their actions.  The House and Senate committees seem to be on the verge of accomplishing something (as do Wray and Sessions), to act on the timeline of the Obama/Crooked cabal conspiring with FBI counterintelligence, CIA Brennan, and others to illegally prevent the other party from coming into power, and then continuing to try and overthrow GEOTUS. So we are looking at trials starting next year.  2-Pro-Trump Majorities In Both Houses   The midterms: We either go all Trump, remain where we are, or lose seats, maybe majorities. Duh. Things look good for us in general, so getting clear pro-Trump majorities is certainly possible, maybe likely :) Imagine the possibilities. Notice what GEOTUS' magic wand has already accomplished despite everything.  The 'resistance' is disorganized, weak and disarrayed. No leader since Crooked went down in flames, the various causes fighting for their own and eating each other, using PC standards to take down their own, money from Soros, donor class and foreigners way down and the DNC broke, and the MSM new business model of simply feeding the trump-hate addiction they created is going to burn out and they can't go back mostly. Politically, the Far Left with energy and numbers is fighting the establishment left with money and experience. They would need an anti-trump and the best they have is average Bernie who shot his wad and sold out.  3-US Economy Grows Enormously   The US economy is poised to become something the world has never seen before. The capital/credit is there, the trillion dollar infrastructure plan, the resources, the deregulation is huge, the skilled labor is there (barely), and the innovation/management. The business and consumer confidence is almost off the charts now. The 500 pound economic gorilla is putting on power armor.  4-European Countries Take Back Power From EU   European elections are happening starting with Hungary (our side wins) in March, and Germany is now a month past its deadline to call for a new election or form a coalition. Other happenings there too. Eastern Europe, see 3 Seas Initiative, might ally individually with America, while the EU becomes powerless.  5-The Middle East Peace Plan (v. Iran) Begins   The Middle East Peace Deal will happen, although Iran and its allies won't sign on. That's ok because everyone else will, and the purpose of the deal is to minimize Iranian nukes, terrorism and starting wars. The alliance against Iran includes America, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the rest of the Arabs and others. Iran will back down I think, or the regime falls, e.g. riots from today. **Without America doing any of the fighting or paying for it.**  6-NK Resolves (Either Caves Or Pulls Trigger) Allowing China-America Comprehensive Deal  North Korea's winter will be in full force with food and fuel gone for the slaves, scarce for citizens and maybe not enough for the army. If China does not save them again, Kim has to ask for a deal with disarmament or pull some trigger.  The deal with China is being run by the NK situation, but when that resolves, serious deal making on all fronts with big changes are looming next year.  This deal would have to cover ALL political and economical issues, and a deal is better than no deal since that costs more.  Biggest negotiation of our lifetimes.  7- Others  People might not think it important but I do: Our space programs, especially the private sector, are going to take off, and I hope big things will be announced.  Socially/culturally/PC war I don't think much will change. Roe v Wade won't be repealed, nor will pro-weed laws. Messed up parents will still inject 7 year olds with hormones, but patriots will be permitted to be patriotic. The best I think we can hope for is that the dividers lose their profit motives and things start calming down.  Kate's Wall will finally start and we'll be satisfied as long as there is steady progress.  The Islamic culture's invasion of the Western culture will slow down a lot as the countries of origin stop sending them and resistance to invaders builds up.  The term 'economic refugees' will be re-discovered.  HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR!  I THINK WE WILL! ======================="

"A policeman is a composite of what all men are, I guess, a mingling of saint and sinner, dust and deity. What that really means is that they are exceptional, they are unusual. They are not commonplace. Buried under the froth is the fact, the fact is that less than one half of one percent of policeman misfit that uniform, and that is a better average than you’d find among clergymen.  “What is a policeman?  “He of all men is at once the most needed, and the most wanted, a strangely nameless creature who is sir to his face and pig or worse behind his back. He must be such a diplomat that he can settle differences between individuals so that each will think he won, but, if a policeman is neat, he’s conceited, if he’s careless he’s a bum, if he’s pleasant, he’s a flirt, if he’s not, he’s a grouch.  “He must make instant decisions that would require months for a lawyer but if he hurries he’s careless, if he’s deliberate, he’s lazy. He must be first to an accident, infallible with diagnoses. He must be able to start breathing, stop bleeding, tie splints and above all, be sure the victim goes home without a limp.  “The police officer must know every gun, draw on the run and hit where it doesn’t hurt.  “He must be able to whip two men twice his size and half his age without damaging his uniform, and without being brutal. If you hit him he’s a coward, if he hits you, he’s a bully. The policeman from a single human hair must be able to describe the crime, the weapon the criminal, and tell you where the criminal is hiding but, if he catches the criminal he’s lucky, if he doesn’t he’s a dunce.  “He runs files and writes reports until his eyes ache to build a case against some felon who will get dealt out by some shameless shamus. The policeman must be a minister, a social worker, a diplomat, a tough guy, and a gentle man. And of course, he’ll have to be a genius, because he’ll have to feed a family on a policeman’s salary.”"
"Uuuuuhhhhh....HUGE... The essence of Obamacare...the forced purchase of private largely monopolized high deductible health insurance has been repealed!  This will save families $10,000 a year or more AND put consumer price pressure back on the medical establishment.  .any families pay over $4000 for largely useless health noninsurance (it doesnt actually pay for healthcare)  Honestly i view this as even bigger and more important than the tax cuts becuase for most middle class people obamacare was far more expensive.  And because all obamacare insurance is cost plus for fhe insurers they never wanted prices to go down . (cost plus - Obamacare Insurance issuers corporate profits are limited by Obamacare law to 5% of total healthcare expenses actually paid so they actually WANT medical providers to RAISE prices so their profits go up. They have no interest in controlling provider prices)  Having more people have less insurance actually forces medical providers to lower costs so they can retain customers. The funny thing about both insurance and loan industry domination of any industry is that it causes prices to RISE because providers have less direct pricing pressure from consumers. (examples people healthcare after insurance , home prices after easy mortgages, college tuition after guaranteed student loans, veterinarian charges after pet health insufance became popular...all went skyhigh)"

Trump will go down as the president with the largest amount of regulation slashing in the history of this country.

I have a good relationship with my mum which I really don't want to fracture over politics (I know it happens a lot) and in general she's a smart person, but the programming has warped her political views to the point where a factual counter-argument to her nonesense is perceived as being 'religious fanaticism' for Trump.  On the one hand, I want to help because its just straight up frustrating how far from the truth her perception of Trump is, on the other hand I couldn't care less because either way Trumps gonna boss it whether she likes him or not. In reality I just want to show her the bright side of things so she's not completely lost when the pin drops after 7 years and Trump actually does an amazingly good job.

"Think about it. Trump basically ran as a independent Candidate during the  GOP Primaries and was forced to sign a Pledge of Allegiance to the GOP. He defeated EVERY GOP Candidate and they still DIDNT Support him after Signing the Pledge themselves.   Now during the Main Election Trump defeated 2 Former Presidents, campaigning for KILLARY. He also defeated the Entire Media Establishment saying Trump had a 10% chance at winning. Now Everyone is out to get him even from his own party.   If a Independent Candidate EVER defeated BOTH THE GOP OR DEMOCRATES that President would A) not get anything done and B) be impeached. After all neither major party would have control over the White House. And Both Parties would be using there connections to create Fake Sex Scandals like the Dossier and or use the NSA to Spy on the Transition team. And knowing how Bitchy the Democrats get when they lose it will probably be them doing all the dirty work as well. "

"Section 222 is applied to all Title II telecommunication utilities.  While most of the bill contains exceptions for throttling, and fastlanes, this section is cut and dry about user privacy.  This means that the carrier is unable to provide and sell our meta data. Titans such as Google, Facebook, and Reddit all want Title II to remain as their money comes from ad revenue and selling meta data. By preventing carriers from being able to sell this data as well, they are securing a substantial amount of the marketplace for themselves and thus prevent competition from driving down their own revenue streams.

You have had members of the House come bowling with Trump, and have tons of meetings. You have all these Senators come up to the White House say great things to the President behind closed doors, or when the cameras are rolling, and sometimes even open up speeches or be invited to some of Pence's and Trump' speeches on jobs and security and whatnot in their home state, and they say they are honored.   But then when they leave 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they act like he is Hitler, and a monster, and that Republicans are the spawn of Satan.

"We are now paying nearly $30,000 a year for health insurance for a family of 4.  This is insane!  I did not visit the doctor once last year.  We are sacrificing are kids college fund , our retirement and more to pay for health insurance.  My wife needed a blood test and it was cheaper to pay for the test directly than to pay the insurance copay!"
How is everyone enjoying the afterlife? 
...were about little kids having to learn about what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.  So basically he would rather have a globalist government that endangers the citizens of the UK verses protecting their borders with the guy like Trump.  **The left truly is diseased and the UK truly is fucked**

"So I was hoping to get a more informed view on the whole CDC word-ban everyone has been freaking out about. I've read two articles on it and was hoping if someone could shed some light.

"https://www.brookings.edu/research/president-barack-obamas-first-two-years-policy-accomplishments-political-difficulties/  Take a look at the date. That's the best way to find a non partisan article comparing Trump to Obama. The article mentions that Dems lost 6 Senate Seats , more than 60 HOUSE SEATS, and like 10 Governiships. But they were ""victims of forces beyond there control"" and everything is Bushs Fault. Can you say referendum on Obama? Republicans lose 1 seat because Dems played the Woman card and everyone is like THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN HAHA.   Liberals don't want to admit it but Trump gets Shit done. Maybe America needs to elect more ""Bully's"" haha "
"[Luke 1:67-80 KJV] And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,   Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.   And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.   And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel."
"Interest fact of the recent passage of the Tax plan was that Democrats invoked the Byrd rule in the Senate to postpone the bill a day and push back to the House for a revote.  The Byrd rule was an invention of Senator Robert Byrd, who invented it to properly budget spending and tax reform. Bernie Sanders invoked it on the name of the bill and two provisions that were “vague” or “had little to no use in a tax bill”.   Have your liberal friends google search Robert Byrd. Or just show them this:  [Robert Byrd in all his glory](http://admin.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2017-08/199985_5_.png)"
"&gt;We originally suggested that it might be worth it for some taxpayers to prepay their 2018 state and local income tax liability this year to maximize that deduction.    &gt;As the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act seeks to simplify the tax code, a last-minute provision closed a potential new tax-planning strategy germinating before the bill even passed  HAHAHAHAHA..."
"Sorry if this is an old idea, I'm an old pede who has lurked since April 2016, so scared of posting because of my job (DoD engy). And I might be a bit drunk on CO moonshine.  But why haven't we taken advantage of the left's turn into the thing they hate the most: the religious right? Think about it. They want to police other's bodies. They want to dictate what other people do with their time and money, forcing them to give money to causes and people they deem are worthy. They want to place their own morality code on everyone's lives. They are closed-minded to new ideas and perspectives.  They have become the thing they have absolutely hated and fought against, their eternal boogyman, the 'fundie'.  Again, maybe the CO moonshine is helping, but I find it HILARIOUS and very sad we haven't memed them into shame for becoming the thing they hate."

"Anons:  &gt;Undoubtedly if it was someone famous or directly relevant to the Clintons, Teigan would have noticed and spouted off more.  &gt;It would have to be someone of significance, but outside of the main spotlight.   &lt;The plane flew over 3 major airports to get back to LA.  &lt;Person allegedly boarded without a proper boarding pass.   &lt;Weakest cover story ever. Planes don't turn around 4 hours into a flight over one person getting their tickets mixed up.  &lt;The only facts we know is that a plane got called back to LAX after flying for 4 hours. Interviews took place (more on that below) and allegedly some form of non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).  &lt;Not even the shills could find another instance of a turn around like this ever happening before. All they could come up with is a plane on the runway returning to the terminal over a ticket problem.  &lt;The person must have been fleeing something. Why return a 777 Heavy for 1 person, the logical decision is to continue to Narita, and send the errant passenger back to LAX, but they didn't-- they interrupted hundreds of passengers and delayed thousands more for 1 person, this 1 person is highly relevant to something  &lt;So they spent $40,000 on extra fuel, isolated everyone for hours, then made them sign NDAs because someone got on the wrong flight? BULL FUCKING SHIT. If any of you ever wonder why the media never reports on the shit you always wonder why they don’t report on? They are 100 percent controlled by a very very small group of people. We are CONSTANTLY lied to and the media feed us the lies. See Vegas.  &lt;Do not forget that all flights in LA and San Francisco were grounded for about two hours.  &lt;But supposedly only one flight took off from SFO (United 1799) for NYC. &lt;It was obviously someone trying to leave the country before arrest. Who has ties to Japan? Pedosta?  &lt;It's hard to believe that on a flight of 150 people not one got a photo of the dodgy passenger and put it on social media.  &lt;How could the other passengers possibly not know? It's highly likely the staff gathered around and questioned the passenger on the flight, if not, the mystery passenger definitely got escorted off by security either when the plane landed or as the passengers left the plane.  &lt;Still looking, but I can't find any solid info on whether a flight would receive a new ID, or would still be the original ID, even a day+ later.  &lt;From what I'm gathering though, it looks like it would keep the identification, and therefore we'd never know via flight changes. Which would mean unless we'd get a list of delays with the delay duration, we likely would be unable to isolate repeat events.  &lt;And why did the shut down THREE airports in CA?  &lt;I like to think this was a special “fuck you” by Trump. Picture it: Some asshole he hates is skipping the country. Maybe fleeing an immanent indictment or arrest. They are freaking out. So nervous! Got to get through security... now get through customs... now we’re on the plane... pushing back from the gate... taxiing... took off... then OUT OF US AIRSPACE!!!! omgomgomg we made it! COME BACK TO PAPA!  &lt;A theory: target and acquaintance being tracked. Acquaintance purchases international ticket LAX to TYO. Target purchases domestic ticket LAX to SFO. Target and acquaintance check in at TSA and gate. Target and acquaintance switch tickets. Target gets on plane to TYO, takes off. Acquaintance gets caught trying to get on plane to SFO. LAX to TYO turns around. SFO and LAX shutdown.  &lt;If there was no way to switch boarding passes physically, the two people might have resembled each other very closely.   &lt;Trump was just on TV at a fire station with a large RESCUE TRUCK prominently on display behind him and told the media “you know what this means”  &lt;Another coincidence: http://deadline.com/2017/12/power-outage-makes-disneyland-a-small-world-with-a-dozen-plus-rides-closed-1202232957/ No updates, almost no coverage.     &lt;Tiegen's actual twitter feed of the incident : https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen Key points, in order: 1. 4 hours into an 11 hour flight and we are turning around because we have a passenger who isn’t supposed to be on this plane. Why…why do we all gotta go back. I do not know.  2. I won’t be able to sleep until I know how this person figured out they were on the wrong flight. (Note: LAX caught an “error” and called the plane back.)  3. Why did we all get punished for this one person’s mistake? Why not just land in Tokyo and send the other person back? How is this the better idea, you ask? We all have the same questions.  4. They keep saying the person had a United ticket. We are on ANA. So basically the boarding pass scanner is just a beedoop machine that makes beedoop noises that register to nowhere.  5. LAX -&gt; LAX flight complete. Flight time, 8 hours and 20 minutes.  6. There is a 20 minutes interview before we can get off the plane.  7. They put our plane I a secure area. We can’t be near common folk.  8. Police were interviewing all the people seated around the mystery person once we got off the plane. Why would they do this! I MUST KNOW MORE!  9. No one will spill anything  I wish I had more for you guys. I wish I could be your Snowden.  10. I’m in a room with water and a TV. The government is using real housewives to keep me quiet!!  11. No one will answer my questions..    "
"Can someone explain to me the difference between Obamacare and what Trumps healthcare plan means. From what Ive read Obamacare is mandatory and after awhile premiums skyrocket like they are now.

"I gave up Facebook a few months ago because I couldn't take the political stupidity that seemed to take over. I honestly have no problem if people disagree with my POV, but seeing the vitriol posted on there put me in a bad mood every time.  Fast forward to today, I used a desktop to reach my account (I deleted the phone app), to say thanks for all the Happy Birthday wishes. I couldn't help but scroll the newsfeed. To my surprise, a LOT of Trump hating, left leaning, people I know seem to be extremely happy with the passing of the tax bill, to the point of posting articles with smiling Trump images associated with them. I honestly can't believe what I'm seeing. RED PILLS ARE REAL. IT'S TRUE, ALL OF IT.   Of course there were still people in the comments complaining how companies giving their employees more money ""reaks of feudalism,"" but they will change their tune once they start benefiting.   Just thought I'd share my experience. MERRY CHRISTMAS!"
"I know it seems completely unlikely for those of us who live and breath politics and think being president is the end all of life in America. If he thinks he has turned the country around and can hand it off to a hand picked guy who he thinks could keep the country going in the right direction (his only true motive I believe), who do you think he would choose? And who would you want to be the 2020 guy? And hell if not 2020, who do you want in 2024? "
"The 700TB drop just doesn't make sense.  One would need an enterprise class storage array to house it all, and transferring it would take over 5 hours at 40GB/s.  Those of you with 'fast' internet connections of 100MB/s would take 93 days to download and that's assuming you have something or somewhere to store 700TB of data.  Even if he dropped it in 10GB chunks it would still be hard to manage (yes I am saying 10GB files are manageable).   It just doesn't seem realistic, that is if you understand handing big data sets.

"Hey fellow Pedes,  I have a question/I am seeking advice in regards to FASFA. Because this is more looking for advice, rather than a question on policy, I figured I’d post here. Please let me know if this still should be posted under the sister sub!   So I am very fortunate that my parents have been able to pay for my college. Unfortunately, I stupidly dicked around and failed a class. They said that they will not be paying for the 2018-2019 school year. I told them I completely understand.  For the 2018-2019 school year I will be filing a FASFA application. My father is a small business owner so due to the way he has to file taxes, his income appears a lot larger than it is, and FASFA will most likely not give us much at all. I figured there are many small business owners among us. My question is how I should go about this? Currently I am obviously a dependent. Should I consider filing as an independent? Would this significantly harm my parents filing in taxes? Should I consider just skipping FASFA, remain as a dependent, and look to apply for a Private School loan? Would love to hear any and all experiences with this and anything you guys would recommend! (Credit Score is 712, only 1 year and 5 months of credit history, 0 derogatory marks, 0 late payments, 3 accounts, 2 credit cards 1 auto loan [co-signed with my father] and average around 15-20% credit usage)   Thank you everyone in advance, I truly, truly appreciate it. Let’s keep MAKING America Great Again.  SPEZ: This is will be for my Senior year, 2018-2019 school year. This year I’ve been working full time and will be paying for my rent/supplies for the first semester with my savings. I’ll have a grand or two left to go towards school. I intend to continue working 25-30 hours a week. And saving majority of it to put towards second semester rent and tuition. Unfortunately, at this point CC is not a viable option. I apologize, I should have added this in."
"I wanted to learn more, and wondered why no one on the news channels was questioning it. So I searched google, and ended up watching my first infowars broadcast ever.  What started as a guilty pleasure, listening to this so-called crazy guy Alex Jones, became a daily ritual.  Slowly I started noticing things on tv that didn’t make sense, things that politicians said that I knew were false.  Over the last few years I’ve gotten better at understanding the game plan to dissolve the US into the world government,  now I feel like Roddy Piper in They Live.  I see most of our leaders for what they are.  Not aliens, but traitors, terrorists, and criminals poorly disguised as politicians and officials. "

"**The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1)** overhauls America’s tax code to deliver historic tax relief for workers, families and job creators, and revitalize our nation’s economy[.](http://i.magaimg.net/img/24ho.jpg) By lowering taxes across the board, eliminating costly special-interest tax breaks, and modernizing our international tax system, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help create more jobs, increase paychecks, and make the tax code simpler and fairer for Americans of all walks of life.   With this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of **$2,059**.   **For individuals and families, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:**   • Lowers individual taxes and sets the rates at 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% so people can keep more of their hard-earned money.   • **Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year** from taxes – from $6,500 and $13,000 under current law to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married couples, respectively.   • Continues to allow people to write off the cost of state and local taxes – up to $10,000. Gives individuals and families the ability to deduct property taxes and income – or sales – taxes to best fit their unique circumstances.   • Takes action to support more American families by:   • **Expanding the Child Tax Credit** from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. The tax credit is fully refundable up to $1,400 and begins to phase-out for families making over $400,000. Parents must provide a child’s valid Social Security Number in order to receive this credit.   • Preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families care for their children and older dependents such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support.   • Preserving the Adoption Tax Credit so parents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open their hearts and homes to an adopted child.   • Preserves the mortgage interest deduction – providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners.   • For all homeowners with existing mortgages that were taken out to buy a home, there will be **no change** to the current mortgage interest deduction.   • For homeowners with new mortgages on a **first or second home**, the home mortgage interest deduction will be available up to $750,000.   • **Provides relief for Americans with expensive medical bills by expanding the medical expense deduction for 2017 and 2018 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, and rising to 10 percent beginning in 2019.**   • Continues and expands the deduction for charitable contributions so people can continue to donate to their local church, charity, or community organization.   • **Eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax** – providing families with much-needed relief and flexibility to buy the health care that’s right for them if they choose.   • Maintains the Earned Income Tax Credit to provide important tax relief for low-income Americans working to build better lives for themselves.   • Improves savings vehicles for education by allowing families to use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary and higher education.   • Provides support for graduate students by continuing to exempt the value of reduced tuition from taxes.   • **Retains popular retirement savings options** such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) so Americans can continue to save for their future.   • Increases the exemption amount from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to reduce the complexity and tax burden for millions of Americans.   • Provides immediate relief from the Death Tax by doubling the amount of the current exemption to reduce uncertainty and costs for many family-owned farms and businesses when they pass down their life’s work to the next generation.   **For job creators of all sizes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:**   • Lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% (beginning Jan. 1, 2018) – down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world – the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation’s history.   **• Delivers significant tax relief to Main Street job creators by:**   • Offering a **first-ever** 20% tax deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income earned by all businesses organized as S corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships. For Main Street job creators with income above this level, the bill generally provides a deduction for up to 20% on business profits – reducing their effective marginal tax rate to no more than 29.6%.   • Establishing strong safeguards so that wage income does not receive the lower marginal effective tax rates on business income – helping to ensure that Main Street tax relief goes to the local job creators it was designed to help most.   • Allows businesses to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers – unleashing growth of jobs, productivity, and paychecks.   • Protects the ability of small businesses to write off interest on loans, helping these Main Street entrepreneurs start or expand a business, hire workers, and increase paychecks.   • Preserves important elements of the existing business tax system, including:   • Retaining the low-income housing tax credit that encourages businesses to invest in affordable housing so families, individuals, and seniors can find a safe and comfortable place to call home.   • Preserving the Research &amp; Development Tax Credit that encourages our businesses and workers to develop cutting-edge **“Made in America”** products and services.   • Retaining the tax-preferred status of private-activity bonds that are used to finance valuable infrastructure projects.   • Eliminates the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, thereby lowering taxes and eliminating confusion and uncertainty so American job creators can focus on growing their business and hiring more workers, rather than on burdensome paperwork.   • Modernizes our international tax system so America’s global businesses will no longer be held back by an outdated “worldwide” tax system that results in double taxation for many of our nation’s job creators.   • Makes it easier for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities.   • Prevents American jobs, headquarters, and research from moving overseas by eliminating incentives that now reward companies for shifting jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants abroad.   **For greater American energy security and economic growth, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:**   • Establishes an environmentally responsible oil and gas program in the non-wilderness 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Congress specifically set aside the 1.57-million acre 1002 Area for potential future development. Two lease sales will be held over the next decade and surface development will be limited to 2,000 federal acres – just one ten-thousandth of all of ANWR.   • Significantly boosts American energy production. Responsible development in the 1002 Area will raise tens of billions of dollars for deficit reduction in the decades to come, while creating thousands of new jobs, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and helping to keep energy affordable for American families and businesses.   • Provides a temporary increase in offshore revenue sharing for the Gulf Coast in 2020 and 2021, allowing those states to invest in priorities such as coastal restoration and hurricane protection.

Mexico is riddled by cartel influence.   They buy over politicians and more recently fund their own electoral campaigns to get their own sitting besides government officials (imagine the mafia sitting next to the Italian prime minister anno 2017)  All this money comes from the cash cow that is the USA (80% of the cartel business is done in the USA)  THEREFOR :  1) Build the wall  2) Cash flow to cartels pockets is stemmed (obviously won't reduce the American market by 100% but will stem the tide)  3) Cartels now have less money   4) must now pick between keep buying government influence that doesn't make money OR develop their business to replace lost cash   6) cartels stop buying politicians because too expensive for no immediate return on investment  7) mexican government gains influence over cartels  8) possible mexican renaissance  All this for the meager price of whatever the wall costs. No wonder Trump said Mexico should pay for it.  QUESTIONS :  How much of the 80% of business the cartel does with the USA actually goes over the land border?  The whole premise of this plan is to assume the vast majority of product is muled over the land border.  Could they replace their land routes with sea routes?  Huge coasts on either side might make it difficult to patrol.  Thoughts?  
"Some of the more extreme forms of pathological lying is Pseudologia Fantastica. This is a matrix of facts &amp; fiction, mixed together in a way that makes the reality and fantasy almost indistinguishable. The pseudologue type pathological liar makes up stories that seem possible on the surface, but over time things start falling apart. Pseudologues have dynamic approach to their lies, they are likely to change the story if confronted or faced with disbelief, they have excessive anxiety of being caught and they desperately try to modify their story to something that would seem plausible to create or preserve a sense of self that is something they wish they were or at least something better than they fear others would find out they are. The excessive anxiety is driven by unusually low self-esteem, the person tries to hide reality by creating a fake reality, and once the story has enduring quality to it, he/she is likely to repeat it and if repeated enough times he/she might start believing in it as well. This reality escape can be triggered of a past incident or of an unbearable present for the pseudologue.”    Read more http://depressiond.com/pathological-liar/"

So don't expect your appeals to emotion such as rage to fly here. I for one did not vote for him for any one issue. Single issue voters are useful but do not expext that shit to be respected around here. Need I list his accomplishments in 2017? How about what he did just as President-Elect. We have a winner here folks. 
"Funny thing was, there were so many lies, that it was funny. It said his NSA agent, Michael Flynn, guilty, but never said for what. It just went on and on and on. At the end he says ""We need to tell this President he's not above the law."" So, did ya'll ignore the times Obama felt he was above the law? Obama did more to harm this country intentionally than Trump ever will. Trump cares about America, Obama cares about our enemies and money. "
Who are the other 3 on twitter pushing the liberal conspiracy theories?  Link between S being uncovered and her getting heads-up and changing her tweets.

It's like they are trying to paint a story of how much of a war hero &amp; honarable man John McCain is.  NewsFlash: He's not.
I just have to share how proud I am to be a part of this great nation. I am with my parents and siblings who are historically pretty liberal and they are all talking about how disgusted they are with the way the media treats President Trump. They are tired of the late night shows and SNL skits focused only on bashing Trump. They are tired of the media and the lies. They are enjoying the benefits that come with a great economy.  They are turning folks. Slowly but surely they are turning. Eyes are starting to open and I can't wait for this next glorious year.  Merry Christmas pedes. God bless.  
"Get in touch with my Jewish side. Learn, practise, be a little more spiritual than I was. Figured I'd tell all of you Nazi's ahead of time so you can come get me. What's that? The Donald isn't full of Nazi's and homophobes? Shit."
"So this Christmas everyone in the family was tasked with bringing a dish and there was going to be like a contest the kids were going to choose the best dish. So i'm like fuck I don't know what to make, im a single guy who can't cook. Then it hit me...I'll make Elizabeth Warren's Pow wow Chow recipe that she plagerized! and I fucking won! The kiddos loved it. Hope ya'll had a merry christmas."

"We can hope, can't we...."
"and not in the way you’d expect. I’ve been a long time lurker here and have posted a couple things myself, but I also enjoy looking through the front page and r/all.   I have seen so many posts, discussions and anger from people who are literally being fed misinformation. Sometimes I’ll actually read an article from one of the other “main” subs and the title is so unbelievably misleading. I type my comment stating the obvious misdirection in title and get downvoted/called a whiner or crybaby.  This sub has saved reddit and redpilled so many people and I couldn’t be happier, but reading some posts just gets me so angry that people will believe anything that the front pages spews in their direction. That’s all. Thanks for lisening, ‘pedes. "
"After Mexicans, Guatemalans are the largest number of illegal aliens in the US, especially unaccompanied minors. 60% of Guatemalan immigrants to US are illegal. I think Guatemala's support for US Embassy move to Jerusalem is an attempt to curry favor in matters of immigration and deportation.  http://www.pewhispanic.org/2017/12/07/rise-in-u-s-immigrants-from-el-salvador-guatemala-and-honduras-outpaces-growth-from-elsewhere/  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html "
"Oh well, there's my christmas conspiracy theory anyway. "
"Think straight think far, don't be a libtard! ��"
"Donald Trump great wording, Our deepest sympathies, and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in Washington State. We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities."
Democrats: We will shut down the thing that's been wasting all of your money for years if you don't give us millions of free voters!  Americans: hmmm... tough one
Can't say the same about McCain
The Trump curse is potent and leaves its victims  with no career after.  It has yet to be seen if being drunk and gay is a cure but top memeologists believe he is headed for certain doom.  
Can you believe he sent White Nationalist Russian males into Iran to protest the peaceful and feminist Islamic government?  This is the kind of racist Islamophobia that CNN tried to warn us about.
I support you having every right I enjoy.

"We could all donate, get thousands of hats made saying MIGA (Make Iran Great Again!), and then ship them to a trustworthy Iranian hand out in Tehran.  Our way of expressing solidarity with the Iranian people."

"Dear Diary,  It has been 13 days since the F.C.C. repealed Net Neutrality.  &amp;nbsp;  I ran out of Doritos and Mountain Dew two days ago, and am seriously thinking about eating the cat.  &amp;nbsp;  Before the end-times, my parents tried to make me leave the house when I was 34, but I kept holding out for a management job. It is very fortunate because I could have actually been at work when the end of the world came.  (No matter what those loser Trump supporters say, living in your parent's basement does have its benefits)  &amp;nbsp;  Thinking about venturing outside tomorrow.   I fashioned a makeshift hazmat suit out of a shower-cap, an old raincoat, and duct tape. I hope it provides enough protection.   If I do go outside, I will have to remember to sing the song of my people ""*Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*"" to announce that I am not a threat.  &amp;nbsp;  *Wish me luck Diary.* "
"Ukraine almost launched WW3, what do you think Iran could end up doing if it gets out of control? We have every right to be euphoric and support our POTUS in wishing them well but we must be alert and cautious. This does not look like the Green Revolution in 2009."
This needs to happen. That whiteness outside would be all the salt from triggered cucks.
In the ama sub
"The  Greatest man in history, named Jesus, had no servants, yet they called him Master. Had no degree, yet they called him Teacher. Had no medicines, yet they called him Healer. He had no army, yet kings feared Him. He won no military battles, yet he conquered the world. He committed no crime, yet they crucified Him. He was buried in a tomb, yet...He lives today!"
Linguistic killshot!
I wouldn't exactly be against taking refugees... 
It's simply implausible to have this much winning. Has he even lost once (for real?) (roy moore is not a loss)
"Geniuses, your idiot pantsuit campaigned for a losing popular vote, Trump campaigned in states to win him the electoral college, Hillary is not popular, Trump won and California can't even govern itself, like hell we are letting that incestuous sewage pile of the dumbest people in the world, dictate each president America will get. Your numbers as a state are inflated to the tun of MILLIONS of illegals, which you let vote and you do not know nor do you represent the best interests in hard working middle American states which quite frankly are a lot more valuable than you as is they provide sustaining services to our economy and our basic needs while you just skateboard."

"A blow-by-blow recounting of a very ignoble career of corruption, deceit, and pathological lying. A career of accumulating hundreds of millions by selling political favors and promises. A career of breaking the law in order to keep her enterprises secret from FOIA requests. A career bordering on the criminally insane.

"Looking at you, Democrats, who don't get the fact that humans can only have massive brains because of their tool-use capable hands that are completely free to carry tools, as well as our extremely efficient sweat glands and our constant need to outwit others in our tribe."

"Most powerful words I've heard him say thus far.  This is STAGE TWO Donald.  To me, this indicates a lot is happening behind the scenes.  Am I alone in this thinking?  Is this the storm?  He never quite explicitly says what is going on (which I hate but also love), but what other ""evil people"" could he be talking about?  Sabotage? "
I'm still not tired of winning!
"Strzok, now Weissman and all of Mueller's Clinton donors on staff are exposed as political. Mueller is incompetent and this investigation is entering very dangerous ground.  He must be removed, he is undermining faith in our government. This circus must end. Our representatives must stand strong against this obvious corruption.   We do not live in 18th century England. We have a constitutional republic and it must be respected."

"Quote from transcript: ""  &gt;Brian Ross of ABC News is the only source to report this. Who is Brian Ross? Brian Ross is the investigative reporters for ABC News who — during a mass shooting in Colorado at a movie theater — immediately began looking to see if the shooter could be a member of the Tea Party. So they found membership rosters of Tea Party members, and, lo and behold, they found of a name in the Tea Party roster that was the same name as the shooter.  &gt;So Brian Ross, without knowing, heads to the nearest camera and alludes to the possibility the shooter could be a member of the Tea Party. It turned out not to be true. ABC News is reporting that “Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians,” and this is why: “to lay the groundwork for mutual efforts against ISIS in Syria.” That’s the big breaking news from ABC.

""ABC's Brian Ross reports: Michael Flynn promised ""full cooperation to the Mueller team"" and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump ""directed him to make contact with the Russians.""

"At first, I was skeptical, but I'm sure of it now. After the Liberal Media collapse, the exposure of Perverted Liberal Hollywood, and the complete inability and scandal that the Democratic Party has shown all of us, it's clear that President Donald J. Trump was the best choice for President of the United States, and is quite possibly the greatest president that we have ever had. He is so selfless, so kind-hearted, and so devoted to our country. Let's not forget that he is doing his 8 year term without Taking a Salary. He is a hardworking, smart, cunning, Multibillionaire who could have retired and lived the easy life. But he heard the call that America was in great peril, after being raped, abused, and extorted over the past 8 years. It's clear that Hillary wouldn't have offered much change, and before you know it, America would have fallen. But Donald J Trump stood among the Hardworking, American people who have built this country from the ground up, whose blood, sweat, and tears have sacrificed so much for our country. Like I said above, I was skeptical, but after seeing the groups who were overwhelmingly polling for Trump (Veterans, Blue Collar American, the Average Joe), and those who were polling for Clinton (Hollywood Elite, Rich Liberals, Wall Street, Criminals), I knew that true patriots were answering the Man who has given so much to help our failing country. And look what happened! Jobs are Coming Back, Illegal Immigration is down, Burdensome Restrictions are lifted, Stock Market is Booming, and all of the bad eggs are being exposed. We see now that the Democrats will vote against great ideas proposed by Trump, simply because they are still bitter that their Golden Girl lost so embarassingly. True Unpatriotic Obstructionists. Now, instead of Corrupt Politicians, we have educated Businessmen running our course to renewed prosperity, A true Military Leader running the World's Greatest Fighting Force, and Religious, God-Fearing men running our ailing Judicial System. It is my belief that God sent and blessed President Trump to conduct the most daunting task in world history, destroy the globalist establishment who has had such a tight clutch on our free nation. As patriots, as men and women of God (only 2 genders), we must support and pray for Donald Trump, our Godsend to lead us out of the darkness and into the light. We are so blessed to have him. Voting for Donald Trump was the greatest decision I've ever made. I wake up every morning with the feeling of safety, security, and renewed prosperity: something I hadn't felt under Trump's terrible predecessor. God Bless President Donald J. Trump and his family. Protect them from harm, please God. We will help you. We will fight the good fight against the brainwashed liberal zombies and return America to its rightful owners, the true patriots who have fought for and have built this country. God Bless the USA. Imprison the NFL Kneelers."
"What we have in this country today, then, is both anarchy (the failure of the state to enforce the laws) and, at the same time, tyranny—the enforcement of laws by the state for oppressive purposes; the criminalization of the law-abiding and innocent through exorbitant taxation, bureaucratic regulation, the invasion of privacy, and the engineering of social institutions, such as the family and local schools; the imposition of thought control through “sensitivity training” and multiculturalist curricula, “hate crime” laws, gun-control laws that punish or disarm otherwise law-abiding citizens but have no impact on violent criminals who get guns illegally, and a vast labyrinth of other measures. In a word, anarcho-tyranny.  Samuel Francis"

Pretty sure this stunt just galvanized everyone on the fence about Roy Moore. This served no purpose other than the lolz. But to do it in a church A HOUSE OF WORSHIP (illegally) garuntee Roy Moore goes +5 in polls by Monday.  This is all the progressives have left.  Mock and ridicule. They are falling off the cliff and clawing at everything on the way to their imminent death. Doug Jones must disavow and condemn.
Is this a brigade?
And they are still losing their asses! 
"My emotions are getting the best of me.  I am truly sickened by the rogue state of our country right now.  California chose to release criminal illegal aliens, they murder a citizen, and the guy doesnt even get a manslaughter charge (if you kill someone, you get a manslaughter charge).  Michael Flynn is charged with lying to the FBI??  Yet, the investigation into Flynn was created based on lies to overturn a presidential election.  Do you understand how fucked up this is????!!!!!!!!! Anyone?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THIS IS WAR.  "
"Over Christmas, I enjoy my political conversations with my fiance's brother, a huge leftist. He truly believes Trump ran for President to get richer and richer. I've gone down the discussion of talking how he had to beat the GOPe and Dems but it was a lost cause, he's somehow convinced... that and Russia. He loves Mueller but I had to inform him about Strzok. He thought Strzok was only involved for Mueller's investigation but I had to inform him that was not the case. There's so many convos... here's just a few for that night.  1) Racism  * bro: Trump is racist.  * Me: He's on record helping POC like Jennifer Hudson for decades, how is he racist?  * bro: He is dismantling all of Obama's policies.  * Me: You think he's dismantling his policies because he's black?  * bro: No [tries to clarify but pivots to ""tax plan giving golf owners tax break on private jets""]  ...[nothing is learned]...  2) Tax plan, jobs, economy boost, small businesses, deregulating  * Me: [after looking up his talking point comes from a pre-existing condition today but not limited to golf owners, as 'commercial real estate' that existed in previous plans]  * Me: According to several of these websites (I listed a few left-leaning ones, he loves Vox), it's a pre-existing condition that just wasn't stripped out but it isn't specific to golf courses, it's commercial real estate.  * bro: goes on some tangent, his dad steps in and sets him straight... discussion continues...  * Me: So this is what you hate about the tax plan? It helps 80-90% of Americans.  * bro: No it helps his rich friends &amp; big businesses.  * Me: No it helps small businesses because they'll be able to compete against the monopolies with the deregulations not choking them out. Monopolies will face competition from the Net Neutrality repeal too.  * bro: [unconvinced] There's no way it'll stop monopolies, it will grow the monopolies. They'll just buyout the smaller businesses or come in and undercut them.  * Me: Well that's the smaller businesses choice but if any [fuckery] happens, the FTC and FCC can step in on a case-basis.   * bro: [still in disbelief]  * Me: These monopolies already exist. I've lived through it [listing examples]. This is Trump's philosophy to help the smaller businesses, grow the economy, and break up monopolies. What do you propose that Trump should do to stop it?  * bro: [pivot]  3) The Wall  * Me: Trump's wall is going to stop illegal immigration and gun &amp; drug trafficking  * bro: [scoffs] it is not going to stop either of those! (not kidding...)  * Me: Okay let's say Trump's wall isn't going to stop illegal immigration, drugs, or guns. Why is he building it?  * bro: because the people are forcing him to.  * Me: so he's upholding his campaign promise?  * bro: No [tries to clarify but pivots to a history lesson that I admittedly don't know much about]  I'm not fabricating any of this... whatsoever..."
"In light of recent developments, anyone know?"
"Alas, as it turns out, Strzok, who was blatantly exposed as a political hack by his own wreckless text messages, also had a leading role in the Hillary email investigation.  And wouldn't you know it, as CNN has apparently just discovered, Strzok not only held a leading role in that investigation but potentially single-handedly saved Hillary from prosecution by making the now-infamous change in Comey's final statement to describe her email abuses as ""extremely careless"" rather than the original language of ""grossly negligent."""
"Ok 4D chess in play. These leaks are forcing Flynn to come before Congress and testify. This is why he did it!!! He is now convicted of perjury which he committed to a crooked FBI agent. This forces Congress to call him back then he can spill his guts with immunity! That explains why everything dropped after the guilty plea. This is the only way to get U1 and Obama in play. Whatever Flynn knows, Congress will know this will be glorious. He then picks up his pardon and goes down as a true patriot. Thoughts?"
Bill Clinton is a rapist
Alex Jones @infowars live!!
"If Mueller was our guy and conducting 2 investigations simultaneously.  One publicly, the Trump Russia one, that is a smokescreen and he knows is false, and the other the real investigation into Hillary, podesta, Uranium one, Seth Rich, DWS, DNC, Awans etc... would be going on behind the scenes.  Why would Mueller not interview Trump or Assange as part of the public smokescreen if he was our guy?  Interviewing Trump or Assange would make the public believe both were guilty.  Imagine CNN with the information that Trump was interviewed.  They'd say there would be an arrest within 24 hours.  Conversely, the fact Assange and Wikileaks haven't been interviewed and never even contacted by anyone investigating in a fucking year also tells me Mueller isn't interested in the truth.    Assange would be the first guy you'd interview.  Assange is the one man in the world who can tell you if it was the Russians or not.  "

"This is war... They want to play their games, we can play ours. We were serious during the election, and it appears we have to get serious again. MAGA doesn't just happen, we make it happen. Lets use this, and remember failure and forge success! MAGA"
It's a poll. Just seems fishy.
"This shit stops now. Arrest elected officials that enforce ""Sanctuary"". The Law is not some al la Carte bullshit you can pick what laws you follow based on feelings.  Its simply embarrassing that it was ever allowed in the 1st palce.     "
Drain the swamp. Good Riddance
I strongly believe that the Swamp Draining aka Storm would not be fully unleashed until Trump was sure the tax reform would go through.  I have a feeling we will start to see Happenings pick up steam quickly! Merry Christmas!

"**A small example of the CF we now have going on: The Budget Process and the Commons Problem**    The congressional budget process itself has contributed mightily to persistent budget deficits. The most important feature of the current budget process is its decentralized nature. At no point in the process does anyone decide on the total amount the federal government will spend. Instead, responsibility for individual legislative bills that determine the total amount of spending is divided up among **fifteen** separate committees in the Senate and **seventeen** committees in the House of Representatives. The Appropriations Committee has jurisdiction for nonentitlement programs covering about 40 percent of the total federal spending. The remaining **60 percent is made up of entitlement programs**, which are handled by various other standing committees. The agriculture committees have authority over farm price supports, food stamps, and other rural programs. The tax-writing committees in the House and Senate are responsible for Social Security and Medicare. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid and shares responsibility for Medicare with the Ways and Means Committee.     **Full description of this goat-roped process, [here](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/FederalBudget.html)**"

Tomorrow's big story for the MSM will be concern about hate crimes against illegals after the Kate Steinle vedict.
"During the transition Flynn went on his own and started talking to Russian(s) about future diplomacy with the Trump administration. With Obama and the Deep State still in power they didn't like the Trump administration leaning forward with dipolomacy as it was still Obama's regime. Deep State leaked Flynn's conversations with the Russians.   Obama Regime told the Trump Administration that they aren't in charge yet and shouldn't be dealing with the Russians yet. Trump administration said, ""we aren't talking to them...we've asked our people and they have all denied it."" This of course was not true as Flynn was talking to the Russians about the future Trump Presidency. This was egg on the face of Mike Pence who asked Flynn if he was talking to the Russians ahead of time and Flynn lied to him.   Flynn is in trouble for lying to the FBI because again, he didn't disclose his conversations with ""foreign entities"".  So, if this supposed to bring down the Trump Presidency...then the shills and cucks in Mom's basement are in for a big disappointment. "

"Below is a text version of @Imperator_Rex3 tweets describing what is really going on with Flynn -  Long, but absolutely worth the read!    1. A few observations on the @GeneralFlynn plea deal.  2. Here are the key documents. READ them all. 99% of people won't &amp; remain ignorant about what's happening here. https://www.justice.gov/sco   3. Ignore the predictable TDS hysteria. Read Andrew McCarthy's article, as always a voice of calm objectivity :http://www.nationalreview.com/article/454269/michael-flynn-plea-no-breakthrough-russia-investigation  4. Important - notice that there are NO charges in relation to FARA / lobbying crimes. Remember the crazed liberals were saying that General Flynn was going to kidnap Gulen and had taken money for illegal lobbying? All BS.  5. The plea offenses are known as 'process crimes', in other words non-compliance with the technicalities of being in an incoming transition.  6. In return for the plea, Flynn will FULLY CO-OPERATE with Mueller's SC. That's what this is all about. And it's not heading in the direction of the Clinton/DNC Trump-Russia lie, that much is certain.  7. To recap : in January 1017, General Flynn didn't tell the truth to Jim Comey &amp; Andrew McCabe's clownshow of an FBI, about meeting the Russian ambassador.  Thank God he didn't.  8. To clarify, an incumbent administration communicating with foreign states, while a lame duck POTUS runs out his or her term, is commonplace &amp; happens all the time. As you'd expect it to be.  9. However, the FBI under Comey &amp; McCabe was a corrupted organization, which Flynn knew well. IMO he did the RIGHT thing not telling them about the communications with the Russian ambassador. It would have been leaked, with the intent of bringing down Trump.  10. In reality, Flynn was used in a scheme cooked up by Sally Yates, Jim Comey and McGahan (WH Counsel) as part of their attempt to bring down president-elect Trump.  11. They used unmasked intel under a FISA warrant (probably based on the Fusion GPS dossier) to ID Flynn and then leaked it to WaPo, a crime.  Yates &amp; McGahan also tried to ambush Trump by saying they warned him about Flynn. It didn't work. Trump was inaugurated.  12. Trump likely became fully aware of what they did in February, but definitely by at least May 8, 2017: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/861592420043157504?s=17 BTW - wouldn't surprise me if he &amp; Flynn knew exactly what was going on as it happened . 13. After his 'resignation', Flynn offered to tell his 'story' in a public Congressional hearing, in exchange for immunity. This was denied. The last thing those snakes wanted was for Flynn to reveal all on live television.  14. General Flynn knows everything about Obama &amp; Clinton. That's because he was the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, serving from July 2012 to his retirement from the military in August 2014.  15. Before that he was a master spook, entrusted with special intelligence missions that none of us are privy to. He had 33 years in the military &amp; intel services and would have an extensive network of IC patriots, as well.  16. Flynn's record is absolutely superb. Which is why Obama, despite his hatred of Flynn, had no option but to renew his full security classification clearance - in January 2016.  17. Mueller was appointed SC in May, 2017. Since then, Flynn would have been providing information to Mueller via his lawyers and also sharing it with Trump's lawyers.  18. This please deal allows Flynn to provide testimony under oath, as well as 24/7 'assistance', to Mueller about EVERYTHING he knows. But it won't be about the Drumpf-Russia lie. It will be about other things. About Yates, Comey &amp; McGahan.  About Obama.  About the Clintons.  19. Much like George Papadopoulos will be revealing all to Mueller, as well, about his role in Hillary Clinton's failed GPS dossier. And like Tony Podesta, who is singing like a canary to Mueller right now.  20. Ignore the crowing of the hysterical MSM today. They have been consistently wrong about everything, because they are basing it all on the Trump-Russia lie. They are 100% wrong on this, too.  21. The reality? Hillary Clinton &amp; Barack Obama, as well as their stooges, will be TERRIFIED of this development. @GenFlynn knows exactly what he's doing - and always has.  Once this is done, Flynn will be acclaimed as one of America's greatest patriots and heroes. Guaranteed.  22. Remember these words from General Flynn's lawyers in March, 2017: 'General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit'. The circumstances now permit. The end.   --  "

"Your Black Muslim Bakery was a chain of bakeries opened by Yusuf Bey in 1968 in Santa Barbara, California, and relocated to Oakland in 1971. A power broker at the center of a local community, it was held out as a model of African American economic self-sufficiency. However, it was later linked to widespread physical and sexual abuse, intimidation, welfare fraud, and murder. After Bey's death in 2003, the bakery fell into debt and declared bankruptcy in October 2006. In August 2007, in connection with investigations into the murder of journalist Chauncey Bailey and a number of other crimes, police conducted a massive raid on the company's San Pablo Avenue bakery. A concurrent health inspection resulted in its closure. Later that day a court ordered the pending reorganization converted into a liquidation bankruptcy."

In my trouble I called upon the Lord: and the Lord heard me, and enlarged me.  The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me.  The Lord is my helper: and I will look over my enemies.  It is good to confide in the Lord, rather than to have confidence in man.  It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in princes.  All nations compassed me about; and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.  Surrounding me they compassed me about: and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them.  They surrounded me like bees, and they burned like fire among thorns: and in the name of the Lord I was revenged on them  Being pushed I was overturned that I might fall: but the Lord supported me.  The Lord is my strength and my praise: and he is become my salvation.  The voice of rejoicing and of salvation is in the tabernacles of the just.  (rejoice, memers!)  The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength: the right hand of the Lord hath exulted me: the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.  I shall not die, but live: and shall declare the works of the Lord.  The Lord chastising hath chastised me: but he hath not delivered me over to death.  Open ye to me the gates of justice: I will go into them, and give praise to the Lord.  This is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it.  I will give glory to thee because thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.  The stone which the builders rejected; the same is become the head of the corner.  (the ""builders"" don't like DJT)  This is the Lord's doing: and it is wonderful in our eyes.  This is the day which the Lord hath made: let us be glad and rejoice therein.  O Lord, save me: O Lord, give good success.  Blessed be he that cometh in the name Lord. We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.  The Lord is God, and he hath shone upon us. Appoint a solemn day, with shady boughs, even to the horn of the alter.  Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, and I will exalt thee. I will praise thee, because thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.  O praise ye the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  "

"after racking my brain about why the courtship between these two I noticed one glaring similarity...and outright hatred for traditional Western culture. And for America.   What is it about America in particular these groups hate?   Answer: Freedom of Speech - Democracy - The Constitution.   I remembered seeing a leftist antifa college professor saying that he didn't find the Constitution to be a relevant document and that really perplexed me. He's supposed to be a professor. If you don't understand or acknowledge the relevance of the Constitution then something, somewhere has really gone awry.   So, my findings are that in a Democracy that values Freedom of Speech and an open forum of ideas you will find a lot of animosity from groups that have ideologies that don't stand up to scrutiny. You see, in the free market of ideas that is Democracy, we have considered the tenets of Islam, we've considered the arguments for Socialism, we've observed the real life effects of both and they've been thoroughly repudiated not with violence but with logic and reason.   They've been disproven and disputed to the fullest. They are inferior ideologies at best, dangerous and destructive at worst.   So, since they can't find victory in debate, they've resorted to propaganda, violence and uprooting the rule of law. They are willing to destroy the world as we know it, just to be right...when they are 100% wrong and either too dumb or stubborn to simply acknowledge it. "

Consider Lois Lerner and John Koskinen at the IRS, hundreds at the V.A., the entire leadership at the FBI and CIA and DOJ under Obama, the CFPB...the list never ends.  Companies fire people every day for violating company policies. Yet when a Congressman harasses or fondles a woman against her will, they are merely subjected to an ""ethics probe"" that tells them to stop.

Maybe this is all just an elaborate joke?
"'Twas the Night before Christmas and all thro' redacted, their walls were plastered with posters of men who had acted. Their stockings were hung by their chimneys so sloppily, in hopes that Ol' Bernie would give some free stuff run by government monopoly. The liberals were sleeping, all snug in their beds, while visions of Obama danced in their heads.  They had signed up for health care and looked at the subsidy, they thought they were in luck, but they didn't realize the deductible was so high the plan was useless unless they got hit by a truck!  Now Ma in her kerchief and I in my MAGA cap, had just settled down for a long Christmas nap. When out in the lawn I heard a great clatter, and sprang out of bed to see what was the matter. I startled my dog so I tossed him some treats, then I ran to the window as fast as Trump's tweets. The moon of the breast of the new fallen snow, gave the lusre of mid-day to the objects below. Then my centipede eyes beheld a sight I'll always remember: it was President Trump and eight cabinet members! As rapid as eagles his fingers on his cellphone buttons flew, sending tweets to every state, even the few that were blue! He told his assistants that he once made a game, but now he was busy and he called them by name. Now Linda, Now T-Rex, Now Devos and Sesssions. On Nielsen, on Mike Pence, on Mattis and Carson! He held his finger to his lips and gave a stern look, and they all fell silent as Pence read a passage from the Old Book. He read about Jesus and goodwill to all men, and when he had finished, we all shouted Amen! They flew up to my rooftop and landed with a big noise, and Mattis was angry because they dropped some of the toys. Out of the sleigh they stepped and took a little pause. Trump was dressed all in red, just like Santa Claus. He came down the chimney with a bag full of gifts, looked at my fireplace and said to me: ""those are some beautiful bricks"" He sat at my table, ate some cookies and drank milk, and handed me a photo signed by Diamond and Silk! He asked for some chips, and to my great shock, pushed aside the salsa and he dipped them in guac! He turned to his cabinet members and he gave them some gifts: handed T-Rex some steaks, and gave Mattis a rifle. Gave to Sessions some Redbull and passed Carson a Nyquil! He handed a CD to Linda McMahon and said ""this one is Elton's best, it's got Rocket Man"". ""Thank you Donald"" she said with a smile, ""I'll give this to Vince, he hasn't heard this song in a while"". Trump turned to me kindly and thanked me for my vote, he said he knew I was volunteering at the shelter tomorrow, told me ""find someone special and give them this coat"". With that he drew from his bag a marvelous jacket, then turned to Ben Carson and asked him to wrap it. Ben wrapped it up nicely so kindly and gently, while Pence sang some carols and Mattis munched on a tendie! Then up through my chimney they hustled so quick, but not without leaving me a gift of four bricks! They hopped in the sleigh to get on with their business,  I rubbed my eyes, startled by their quickness. Trump threw me a thumbs up as he fistbumped with Ben, and shouted ""No more Happy Holiday's, we're saying Merry Christmas Again!"""

I believe Mueller is doing everything to get himself fired because he knows the investigation is going nowhere.

"If there was civil discussion on the decision of keeping or reversing the Title II reclassification, they might have had a chance of keeping it.

They've said things like ""punch-able face"", ""no net December"", and IIRC, some people tried to dox his children. Its really true isn't it?, when people don't have an argument, they go after your character and and the things you love.   I understand some of these things are intended to be jokes, sure, but combined with all the misinformation from Reddit and other social media, this makes the ""Pro-NN"" side look like, quite frankly, a bunch of uninformed assholes. Of course the FCC chair is going to continue his decision, there wasn't any argument! And now hes pissed off, what'd you think he was going to do?! These assholes' main argument was ""Big rich corporations and monopolies are evil. ISPs are big corporations and are therefore evil. What evil things would an evil corporation do?, they might abuse their power, so evil. We need to punish big corporations! before they can abuse it!"".

"I remember that morning well. I was on a business trip to London at the time. I was too scared to look at the news and my wife texted me: ""Congratulations, baby! Your country is gonna be great again!"" (She is Ukrainian and we live in Kiev).  And there I was, in the cuckiest city in all of the United Cuckdom, riding the tube with a bunch of cucks, wearing the biggest sh*t-eating grin on my face because the American people prevailed and Donald J. Trump was elected President of the United States.  And then there's this morning. When I wake up to find that even the Cucked News Network is reporting that the Russia Investigation has fired the very same anti-Trump agent who interviewed Flynn and has been revealed to have covered the crimes of Hillary Clinton AND was at the higher leadership of the doomed Russia Investigation. I just can't stop smiling.  Of course we have all long ago realized what the cucks refuse to see: that the Russia investigations were set up from the start to de-legitimize the Trump presidency in hopes for a 2018 ""Blue wave"" (LMAO!). It just feels incredible to witness this kind of backlash.  But i want you to savor the sweetness of it. Because now we see that the Dems--in their insistence on pushing the nonsensical Russia narrative--have once again Wiley-Coyote'd themselves, for rather than bringing indictment and impeachment upon Trump, they have readjusted the focus on Hillary Clinton's crimes. The delicious irony is almost too much to bear. I still can't stop smiling.  And as much of a disgrace as this whole 'muh russia' nonsense has been for 11 (eleven!) months, I kind of want the libtards to continue to trip over their own bullsh*t that they've insisted on smearing across their foreheads, because the more they do it, the more victories I get to enjoy with my stupid, sht eating grin.  #MAGA my fellow centipedes.

"I’m not a republican nor democrat nor American. I want to share my opinion regarding the whole “Russian collusion” thing.   This is what’s been happening for the last year:  A news Agency posts a headline reading something like “Russian Collusion proof right around the corner” followed by a quote taken out of context. Then trump supporters say that it’s fake. The left calls trump supporters nut jobs and conspiracy theorists. A few days later the news agency says something like “hey just so you know this isn’t what we meant lol “ basically/literally fake news. That whole situation you guys were right the left was wrong and you should get a point. Considering that this has been happening for so long now makes you think that you guys have hundreds of points already and the left just makes itself look dumber and dumber. Now I understand why you guys keep saying that winning feels good lol.   Anyway I don’t support the left nor the right, so this isn’t the usual post here. The front page just infuriates me so much, worldnews is nothing but shitty news agencies saying something against trump and days later it means nothing. "
"Allow me to break down the level of Chess Trump is playing.  A country where the population outpaces job growth cannot have a sustainable economy. When jobs are few, businesses are able to force workers to compete for work. Conversely, when there are more jobs available, businesses are forced to compete with each other for workers. When this happens, wages and benefits increase. Those jobs that we apparently need Mexicans to do suddenly become desirable because the value of the work increases. It's simple as to why. It's because when the labour force is smaller, you're not so easily replaced.  Iran learned this the hard way. After major sanctions were placed on them, Iran learned that in order to maintain a stable economy in the face of economic hardship, the economy must be grown before the population.   Texas also learned this lesson recently as Trump began [enforcing standing immigration laws.] (http://redalertpolitics.com/2017/08/07/wages-increase-construction-farm-workers-trump-cracks-illegal-immigration/) It should come as no surprise that once illegal immigrants started being deported, the average wage began to increase.   Trump understands this. He understands that businesses have to pay more if there isn't an abundant source of cheap labour. But make no mistake, corporate leaders understand this also. It was never altruism that convinced people like Jeff Bezos to be against The Wall. He just doesn't want to pay a fair wage. That's also why Amazon is so focused on researching automation.  Now if Trump just left his work here, America would have been in trouble. However, Trump is a genius. It's one thing to force businesses to pay their workers a higher wage, but it's another to convince them to stay. This is where it comes into play.  Trump understand that raising the minimum wage to $15hr is simply inflation and will decrease the buying power, much the same way that a $20 wage in Yukon has the same buying power as $10 in Vancouver. Prices up north are adjusted for those wages. He also knows that forcing businesses to pay more not only kills small businesses, but offers a disincentive for corporations to stay. His solution? The amazing tax plan.   While businesses will have to pay higher wages to their workers, they can afford to do so because they will be allowed to keep more of their earnings. The buying power of your dollar remains the same, but now you keep more of it.  None of this would be possible if only half of this was enacted. Trump needed to enforce immigration to increase wages and he needed slash taxes so that businesses could afford to raise them. The man is a genius. He saw a better way to do what the Democrats wanted but without any of the obvious impending disaster from the way they would have implemented it.  Americans, you owe President Trump a huge debt of gratitude. I hope it's not lost on any of you how massive this really is."

"In 2010 I was 13, my dad was laid off of his job as an Network technician at Verizon. He worked there for over 10 years, when it was still MCI Worldcom before the Verizon buyout. With the economy that Obama put us in after a year, he was unable to find a job, even with his experience. Car reposed, house foreclosed, bankruptcy declared. We were forced to move across the country to live with my grandparents for the next 2 years as he worked as a GM at a Sonic, still constantly applying for jobs. He got a second job and we were finally able to move out. A family of 5 living off of 2 wages from fast food. We went a year and a half without gas, so no heat and no hot water. Days where I would come home and power would be out. Learned to live without cable, and to use my neighbor's wifi after asking them. We had (still have) the most Saint of a land lord, she understood our circumstance and allowed for so much grace on the rent. It was rough for a high schooler. Over 4 years after, my dad gets a job in the IT field again. For the 2.5 years he worked there we still struggled since he was trying to pay off our bills that accumulated. He left for an even better job later. With the economy booming under Trump we've gotten our lives back. I was able to even get an IT internship myself after getting a certification. It's going great. With the hard work of a family man (90+ hours a week), and Trump taking office, we were able to overcome.   BY THE WAY, as my dad's boss was walking him out of the building for the last time, he asked him if he wanted to know why he was chosen to be let go. ""Because you were the only middle aged white guy, you wouldn't have been able to sue us"". There was a Korean, two 55+ men, a black guy, and a women in the department."

"""Why did Sessions recuse himself?""   Among the most common questions asked around here this past year. Why did he do it? Why hasn't he stepped back in?   I went back and reread ""The Art of War"" last night. Trump's favorite book. Some of the points that stuck out to me:  ""All warfare is deception."" (actual quote, the rest is paraphrased.)  *Attack your enemy where they least expect it. Attack when they don't expect you to attack. Be who they do not expect you to be.  Pretend to be weak, lull them with a false sense of security, draw them in, and then strike. Let them make the first move, and adapt your counter move accordingly. Take what they give you, and use it against them. Turn their strengths into their weaknesses. Let them make the first mistake--and every one after. Let your enemy defeat himself. Use his own energy against him. The general who is patient-- and carefully prepares his plan, his tools, and his team-- is also successful. When you do attack, overwhelm the enemy. The most advantageous trait a general can possess is that of The Moral Law. The general with The Moral Law on his side can never be fully defeated.*    I've come to the realization that the Q musings on the Mueller-double-agent angle may be more than just a theory or LARPing. I thought it was an interesting theory when I first read it, but definitely a long shot. (that Mueller is actually working for Trump under an MI operation to expose the REAL Russian collusion)   When I look current events through the lens of Sun Tzu, it only continues to make more sense as the events unfold.   Let's look at what has transpired with the Russian Collusion plot.   **Attack your enemy when they least expect it.**      The Trump/Patriot camp realizes that the Establishment plans to nullify the election with a Russian connection via a FISA warrant. The Patriots (consisting of MI, and loyal agents in Alphabet Intelligence Community) likely already knew about the Clinton/Establishment deal with the Russians, and perhaps even anticipated the Alinskyite tactics.   **Attack where they don't expect you attack.**        The Plan: [Counter Move] Turn the Russia investigation against them, and expose their own corruption. Use the fake investigation as a trojan horse for a REAL investigation.   **Be who they do not expect you to be.**         The best person to prosecute-- i.e. take on-- the establishment is somebody that they highly praise, fully trust, and perhaps even believe is so far in their corner, that he will do ANYTHING to bring Trump down. A friend. An insider. A double-agent.   If Jeff Sessions were the one to lead the prosecution against the Clintons, the left would never allow him to do his job in peace, let alone sit still long enough to listen to his findings-- not that they would believe them, anyway. That's EXACTLY what they were expecting to happen. Sessions come for Hillary.  **Pretend to be weak, lull them with a false sense of security, draw them in, and then strike.**               Once you put the Double-Agent in charge of the investigation, you have him fill the team with hardcore Anti-Trumpers. The more rabid, the better. Identify people who have a wreckless hatred, and are likely to do something stupid. The enemy is giddy with glee at the prospect of such a powerful super team of anti-Trumpers going after the man himself. What luck! What fortune! They are too busy drinking the Kool-Aid to realize that they are drinking poison.   Every scheme needs a patsy to take the fall, and whom better than the very group trying to destroy Trump? (Intel Community) Kill 2 birds (Clintons/Deep State) with one stone. Sessions would never be able to assemble such a group without raising suspicion, and they would likely be more cautious and less self-incriminating with him at the helm. With Mueller in charge, everybody thinks they are there for a singular purpose. (destroy Trump)  **Let them make the first mistake--and every one after.**           Even before the text messages came out, the very fact that 9 of the 15 investigators DONATED to the Hillary campaign was enough to call into question the legitimacy of the findings. The text messages are the string that will unravel the sweater.  There's always the chance that the Patriots/Mueller knew about the texts before bringing the guy on board, making the trap a sure thing. If that is the case, then the mistake that the enemy made was being so trusting and complacent.  **Take what they give you, and use it against them. Turn their strengths into their weaknesses.**                    The left offers up identity politics and divisive rhetoric about hate speech and oppression to rile up their constituency. They have trained them to hate rich powerful white men that rape and abuse women. So then, expose the trainers for what they are: rich powerful white men that rape and abuse women; and let the lions eat them alive. Better yet, expose the trainers that have been directly funding and supporting the target of the investigation. (Weinstein and friends)  **Let your enemy defeat himself. Use his own energy against him.**           The left has trained their followers to feed off of each others fervor. It becomes an infectious virtue signal that only spreads further the more attention it receives. Therefore, when the prominent figures are exposed, it will launch a feeding frenzy that is self-sustaining, and triggers a chain-reaction that brings down the whole system. (of the left)   **When you do attack, overwhelm the enemy.**              The reason the Clintons and their allies have been so cocky over the years is because of how well insulated they are. Think about it. The left owns the entire government (ruling class-- politicians AND deep state); arts and music (culture); entertainment and sports (distraction); education/technology and media (information); and until recently, the proletariat (working class). They had every corner of our civilization in their back pocket, and if any one of them fell under siege, the others would rush to their aid.   But what if they all fell under siege simultaneously, and what if the means of attack (exposing abusive behavior) were such that, not only could others NOT rally to their side, but they would actually need to DENOUNCE their allies in order to survive? No coincidence that when the biggest Clinton supporters and money-men started going down, the media started turning on the Clintons-- which then renders them vulnerable to honest prosecution. Only possible if it is all happening together.    As for **""The Moral Law,""** Sun Tzu said that few generals truly embody the will of their people, and look out for them above all else; but when they do, the people will die for them, and fight to the very last man. When a leader truly shares the beliefs of the people they lead-- rather than adopting them based on popular opinion-- it bonds them to the people, who embrace him as one of their own. Sound like anybody we know?       Bill Clinton is a Rapist. Hillary Clinton killed Seth Rich.  Spez: spelling"

And then all the people in the store started whistling and cheering. When I was walking out of the store everyone dropped everything they were holding and gave me a round of applause. I looked back through the windows and they had all lined up facing me and continued clapping.   Just kidding, stuff like this only happens in the delusional left's wildest dreams.

"It's quite simple.  See the following image: https://i.imgur.com/HL7CR9Q.png  This is exit poll data provided by the WashingtonPost.  The data is very clear. First, 51% of the electorate said Trump played no factor.  19% of Jones voters said that in part, they voted out of anti-trump resentment.  27% of Moore voters voted for him in part **BECAUSE** of trump.  Which means, to the extent that Trump was relevant in this election, it is abundantly evident that it was to a POSITIVE EFFECT for the moore campaign, **by a margin of +8pts**  If it weren't for Trump and Bannon, moores numbers may have actually been a lot worse.  No one intellectually honest can look at that exit poll data and conclude somehow that this election was a repudiation of trump. In fact, it suggests the exact opposite. Trump was one of the best things going for Moore.   Politico and other fake news is already putting out how this was a bitch slap for trump, but the data blows that false narrative right the fuck out of the water.   I suggest everyone familiarizes themselves with the above data to dismantle what will obviously be a common mythological talking point."

"Specifically - they're halving karma of T_D posts. After getting lucky with a sticky post today (mods are gods), I followed it up with a few other well timed ones and netted - individually over the course of the day - 7500 post karma.  My counter on the other hand has only gone up .5 of the combined total (It's started the day in the mid 88k's - I screen-capped the page in the morning - but reflects only half that in increase presently).  Apologies to the /u/ who pointed this out initially (because I can't find your name or an appropriate search word to find it in my comment history), but I'd have to say he's on to something. There's a certain strangeness in upvotes too - even with downvotes we've had a tilt with individual upvote scores on high-traffic posts. I say this without any certaintly - but I do recall one day in the last year when all the posts on hot were literally one additional digit higher (x10) than previously reported. Then they switched back from 5 digit numbers to 4. With the traffic, the T_D user base - there's some major number-buggery afoot. **[I mean how does this metric make any sense?](https://redd.it/7jybc3)**  (Ya I know - ""what are you a karma whore"" - yes, sometimes - but in this case I specifically pulled out the stops with the sticky to do some number crunching and as someone else pointed out - something's up - and it's not accurate scorekeeping. Reddit is really fucking around with T_D's ratings. Not just on the front page - but even inside the sub.)"

I believe this is yet another attempt of a political attack against the POTUS, through stoking a fire within society, so that the next major accusations against Trump ride the tidal wave that is the ""damn the man"" agenda, with 20+year old events all of a sudden coming to light.   EDIT: I am not saying that these accusations against Spacey, Weinstein et al are false. What I am saying is that events which were allowed to go unreported, and which were considered minor enough by the victims at the time to not worry about reporting them, are all of a sudden coming out with emotional condemnation of the ""perpetrator"", the moment a political motive comes into play.

"**Every policy,** but one policy (we are going to say Merry Christmas again) is rooted in an economic (or military) reason.  The wall? Moving average wages towards American wages by removing the illegal pool.  Tariffs? To make American companies more competitive in their own country.  Heavy action on North Korea and islamic terrorism? To exploit America's oversized military to eliminate as many threats as possible, so that freeing up resources dedicated to the military becomes possible.  Declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel? To curry favour with Israel to get even greater access to their spy network. Also saves on fuel costs.  Anti-abortion? So that the US has as many workers with US parents as possible. Also pleases his white male base, but whatever.  Tax reform? Self explanatory.  Deregulating internet? To destroy internet monopolies and make starting an ISP more attractive.

"What Obama is doing right now: He mirrors every Trump visit and tries to persuade world leaders  NWO agenda is still On, and how they should stay on course.   How every conversation looks like: _We will oust Trump. Stay on course, or when we get the full power back there will be no mercy._  He is touring the world trying to ensure loyalty by threats and promises, so that nobody jumps the NWO ship. They think they will get rid of Trump by 2020 and will try to start immediate crackdown on everything to prevent another Trump.   We need to be winning elections for the next 20 years or we are all dead.  Once they elect Swamp Monster again, they will **do everything they can** to prevent another Trump happening. It will be Hillary on steroids.   TL;DR;  We should already be preparing for 2018 and 2020.   They have already started crackdown. Twitter is doing purge as we speak.

"They really thought they were going to get Sarah with that Tweet and their (moronic) inferences and she destroyed them enough they wouldn’t talk about it much.  Trump set them up to allow Sarah to expose Gillibrand, that’s why she called on MSM puppets like Ryan.    These are the stupidest people and it’s so fun to watch them fall for Trump Trap^^TM after Trump Trap^^TM.  She threw Hillary under the bus as well.  So many burns!

"Make no mistake, they absolutely are very intelligent, they've been at this for years and years-- they are not incompetent or negligent, they are corrupt, evil, seditious and incredibly cowardly.   All the people the Clintons have killed, spirit cooking, 9/11, supplies not being handed out in Puerto Rico, Soros funding BLM, election fraud, Obama pay for play, Yates admitting she was the leaker, folks lying to the FBI and getting away with it.  The list goes on and on, what happens about it? Nothing, they're untouchable until proven otherwise.  While we, the public fight with each other, divided not united, they empty out California, through HIV, race baiting, fires and more. If successful, it will be the same as New Orleans in terms of population reduction.  The homeless get on buses and disappear, never to return-- just how most of the people displaced by hurricane Katrina will not return, many will not return to Puerto Rico and soon, California.  We have the 9th circuit or whatever going sensational over ""travel bans"" and extreme vetting-- but the propaganda tell us it's a big deal, while you can spread HIV in California and it's a misdemeanor, no longer a felony, but that's fine because the media doesn't tell us to care about it.  Mustard gas was a biological weapon in the past, now they're changing laws to seemingly encourage folks to spread HIV, a disease-- how does this benefit anyone? It proves they can do whatever they like and get away with it, it empowers their reputation as the elite aristocrat nobles.  South California fires? If you're forced to sell your home for a fraction of the cost (the land) and still pay the mortgage under some agenda 21 bullshit, are you truly in the land of the free?  Hoping we can get some Cali-pedes reporting on the above, I really hope agenda 21 isn't being forced upon people there but after all the shit the loser state continues to pull, wouldn't be surprised.

"Hello fellow Centipedes!    New Jersey ‘Pede checking in.   I usually don’t post I’ve been seen a ton of posts about our legislators and upper-echelon leadership making cucked and terrible decisions and need to get the word out. That motivated me to really being into perspective for some people on what New Jersey is ACTUALLY about. Would love for other Jersey pede’s and pede’s from other cucked states to chime in as well.  There are still plenty of holdouts in New Jersey.  Here is a an interactive map of how every county and every town voted in the 2016 Presidential election.   [Interactive Map (Kek out the unintentionally hilarious election night images.)](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/11/how_your_town_voted_in_the_2016_presidential_election.html)   Most of New Jersey is conservative Irish/Italians/European decent with loyal and respectful family histories and morals (with exceptions to organized crimes.) New Jersey has a rich history of a lot of great and hardworking legal immigrants that entered this county to escape persecution, and great a better life for themselves. We support our first responders (even the lefties for the most part) and try to live in harmony. It’s just the gerrymandered inner cities in the northeast and southwest that push these people into office. If you look at Essex County, we are split down the middle: to the east is the dangerous, urban inner cities ridden with once thriving neighborhoods of a hard working melting pot of immigrants and big families. To the west side is now suburban families and money that originated in the eastern side until crime forced a great immigration out that culminated largely after the 1967 Newark riots. If you look at Western Essex county, you will see there is still stronghold towns holding down and fighting the good fight.   WHAT I ASK is to not judge us all. We try our hardest despite the terrible image and wrap New Jersey gets. Our republicans haven’t done everything correctly and it’s a shame because it was one of the few chances we had to prove something here; but Here’s to hoping. It’s a beautiful state outside of that airport. Come and take a look for yourself. I’m happily located an hour from the shore, and hour from the mountains, 20 minutes from NYC, and an there’s plenty of forrest and State Park. The best view of NYC is from Jersey after all. Don’t just us all. Thanks!  Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, &amp;  Warm Regards,  Streeter17 - Air Force Vet  MAGA.   "
"A Visit From St. T  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the House,  Not a creature was stirring, not even a Louse;  The Promises were hung by the chimney with care,  In hopes that GEOTUS soon would be there;  The snowflakes were nestled all snug in their beds,  While visions of ""Bernie's Back!"" danced in their heads,  And Lady Pede and I in our red MAGA caps,  Had just settled our brains from two long winter’s ""naps""-  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.  Away to the window I flew like a flash  Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash.  The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,  Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below;  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,  But monster choppers with the Man in the rear  With his proud grin, so lively and quick  I knew in a moment it must be God's Pick  More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  And he signaled, and shouted, and called them by name:  ""Now Gowdy! Now Nunes! Now Grassley and Rand Paul,  On Matthis! On Big Rex! On Pence, Barron and all,  ""To the height of fortune! To celebrate the Wall!  ""Now Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock away all!""  As reee-reees before the wild hurricane fly,  When they meet with Reality, triggered so high  So up over the blue states the scourges they flew  With Apaches full of red pills dropped by Melania too.  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof  The roasting and laughing at each CNN goof  My sides splitting as I was rolling around  Down the chimney GEOTUS came with a bound:  He was dressed all in glory, from his head to his foot,  And his clothes were so fine, even better than Newt;  A bundle of XOs hung on his back,  And he looked like a savior just opening his pack:  His eyes - how they twinkled! his dimples how merry,  His brows were friendly, his smile so very;  His witty mouth was ready, drawn like a bow,  And the hair on his head was as ready to go;  A .45 cartridge he held tight in his teeth,  And the smoke encircled his head like a wreath.  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  He had a great face, much better than telly  That shook when he laughed, like napalm jelly:  He was strong and tall, a Biblical self,  And I roared when I saw him in spite of myself;  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  And fulfilled all the Promises; then turned with a jerk,  And laying his finger aside of his nose  And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.  He sprung to his Long Bow, to his team gave a whistle,  And away they all flew, like a launch of Cruz missiles.  But I heard him exclaim, ere he flew out of sight-  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! "

"We’ve learned in recent months that the FBI is riddled with Obama’s minions and has been transformed into the rogue criminal arm of Obama’s shadow government. The FBI is now fully operating as essentially Obama’s secret police, as these law enforcement agencies are now doing the bidding of slimy politicians, rather than upholding their oath, which is to pursue impartial justice on behalf of the public. After President Trump learned of an attempted coup last week being actively led by swamp creatures Robert Mueller, James Comey, and Peter Stzok, now an another investigation is uncovering the unbelievable plot that FBI agents were carrying out before President Trump even took office.   As Rober Mueller’s illegal investigation into President Trump continues, we’re now learning of the ridiculous antics of two Mueller FBI officials who were plotting throughout the 2016 election to prevent Trump from being able to be elected president. In a breaking new scandal, two FBI agents exchanged ongoing text messages that are now becoming public knowledge thanks to this new investigation.   Matt Vespa of Townhall noted: It’s quite unsettling to see members of our nation’s preeminent law enforcement and intelligence agencies thinking of ways to screw over the next president of the United States simply because they don’t like him or her.”   As soon as Mueller learned of these incriminating text messages, he quietly reassigned Strzok to the FBI’s human resources division. But now Strzok has outrageously returned the FBI so he can plot even more against our President alongside these swamp creatures.   “Democrats and the media are accusing anyone who criticizes special counsel Robert Mueller as Trumpian conspirators trying to undermine his probe,” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board stated earlier this week. “But who needs critics when Mr. Mueller’s team is doing so much to undermine its own credibility?   “That fact that it appears Mueller removed Strzok from the investigation as soon as he find out about the messages tends to underscore Mueller’s seriousness about keeping the investigation free from even the appearance of bias,” said Lawrence Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, to Vox.   As this witch hunt against President Trump continues, what most people don’t realize is that Robert Mueller special counsel investigation is highly illegal. In order for an investigation to even be launched against the President in the first place, the Department of Justice’s regulations first require a crime to be committed, yet no crime has ever been named in order to even justify the special counsel appointment to even take place.   Strzok and Mueller have not only launched an illegal investigation into Trump, but are now attempting to fabricate material as a pretext to demand his impeachment as they try to engineer and fabricate crimes against Trump in order to justify this ongoing witch-hunt.  One shining example of this was the guilty plea that these two swamp creatures were able to attain from General Flynn that “stems wholly from the FBI deceptively interviewing Flynn under false pretenses, then catching him in a misstatement when he didn’t even realize he was being interviewed as part of a criminal trap,” Natural News exposed.   Now Obama’s rogue secret police (AKA these crooked FBI officials) are now engaged in a massive cover-up, blocking damning information on Peter Strzok to make sure it doesn’t go public because they know this information would nullify the entire investigation.    “The FBI blocked all information on its website about a top counter-terrorism official who was kicked off of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation for sending politically-biased text messages to an FBI lawyer,” reports the Daily Caller began. “It was revealed on Saturday that Strzok was removed from Mueller’s team in August after the Department of Justice’s inspector general discovered that he exchanged anti-Trump and pro-Hillary Clinton text messages with his mistress, an FBI lawyer named Lisa Page who also worked on the Mueller team.”   The FBI is absolutely out of control at this point as it clearly considers itself above the law and is merely working as the arm of Obama’s rogue criminal secret police. These crooked swamp creatures have absolutely no interest in justice, and are simply existing to do the bidding of Barack Hussein Obama who continues to prove how far he’s willing to go to have Trump removed as President, where he continues to break federal law by meeting as a civilian with foreign officials behind President Trump’s back."
"A conversation about the word cuck came up and I noticed that people do not fully understand our use of the word.

We have seen this before too with Mike Pence being ridiculed for not eating with a female who is not a direct relative.   What we learned here is that the Alinsky tactics still work eventhough we're on to them and we have to figure out a way to counter it quicly, otherwise MAGA is done."

"I personally love cops. I think 99.9% of them are great. But there's still obviously that .1%, and I think Philip Bradsford was one of them. I assume a lot of people have probably seen the MesaPD officer shoot a drunk man (Daniel Shaver) for ""possibly reaching for a gun"" and then he claims after he would do it again in a heartbeat under the same circumstances. With ""You're fucked"" carved into what I believe was the barrel of his gun.   He was recently found not guilty of any charges but I wanted to see what you guys thought?  I personally, as I said, love police. Which is why I think this sucks because all the amazing policemen and police women out there have to suffer because of the reputation people like Bradsford give them.   Am I the only one who sees it this way? Maybe I'd like to hear from someone who's seen the video and think it's justified?  Like, why couldn't they have just gotten one of the officers there to handcuff him while his hands were straight up or behind his back? Why the seemingly rediculous rules? It was obvious the guy was drunk and literally crying for his life and they expected him to perfectly execute their commands? Doesn't make sense to me but I'd like to hopefully keep it civil and hear what everyone else thinks. "

This was relayed to the Transition team by the general council of the GSA, one Richard Beckler.   Of course, we can't get affirmation of this fact, because--SHOCKING--Beckler is dead. Beckler was appointed to his position in the GSA and died months later of an illness. Now, obviously he was in his 70s but so is our esteemed President, as well as 60% of Congress. Generally people that age don't suddenly keel over and die unexpectedly.

"I live in Minnesota and work in I.T. for a contract manufacturing business. While MN didn't go red I spent many months trying to red-pill people on Facebook during the 2016 election and through most of 2017. I lost a lot of friends that were liberals and felt very oppressed and alienated but my city voted fro Trump and won by about 400. I no longer have Facebook though thankfully. So that was a good feeling. Anyway, we haven't had a bonus the last 3 years and I think the tax plan really helped them decided to give us one this year and sales were much better this year.   I firstly thank God for anointing Donald Trump for such a time as this and Donald Trump for giving up his life to fight for what's righteous and good."

"Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), in a private Democratic Caucus, said the revealing clothing that some female members and staffers wear is an “invitation” to sexual harassment.  I am an old-school feminist and was taught in college to believe that a woman never invites rape or harassment, no matter what's she's wearing.  But I have to agree with Kaptur. There's a time and place to wear revealing clothing, and the job isn't one of them. I've been to meetings where some women's cleavage was so reveling that I had a hard time concentrating -- not to mention having to force myself to look up or sideways.  If I, a happily heterosexual woman has this problem, I can only imagine what normal warm-blooded men go through.   Link: https://archive.is/eTVns"

Why doesn't Donald Trump hold a press conference or speak directly to the people in a live broadcast and then spend 4+  hours just debunking all fake news and show the people how they have been lied to and show them proof of it?  That would be a huge red pill for the whole nation and the media wouldn't be able to censor or twist it as it is live broadcast.

So a friend's family are sort of trump supporters. They are basically establishment republicans who have unfortunately been watching a lot of morning talk shows and weapon grade propaganda like jimmy kimmel and cock holster Colbert and now probably will not vote trump again. They are a family of 4 with 2 children in college. One parent is a small business owner (&lt;50 employees). One makes approx 130k and one makes approx 50k. Where will they see the greatest tax cuts if any because of this new tax bill. 
Especially President Trump and his whole family!

"Most people are willing to recognize that next year, their taxes will be cheaper. Some people say things like ""we will lose the differences in loss of deductions"" but i did my math for teachers and that's not true because their expenses are LESS THAN the savings they'll be seeing... but the other common argument against it is that the savings are there just to keep us happy for now but in like 10 years the tax plan will start funneling all of our money to the rich. Can someone fucking help me dispell this?   it's not true right?"

"Trump and nethanyahu are working on this together.  When they initiated the change among Saudis and Sunnis to cut off support for their terror groups that was just part of the plan because if the Sunnis stood down their militias Iran would take over.   This is why simultaneously as the Saudi purge is happening, Trump and nethanyahu launched part 2 which is about Iran.  https://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/834185?section=newsfront&amp;keywords=nuclear-weapons-agreement-foreign-policy-tehran&amp;year=2017&amp;month=12&amp;date=28&amp;id=834185&amp;aliaspath=%2FManage%2FArticles%2FTemplate-Main  As I said, standing down the Sunni militants was already achieved through diplomacy and the Saudi purge. Now the target is Iran's Shia proxies. The key is that Obama's deal gave Iran money which is being used to fund them.   America brands Iran's proxies as terrorists therefore the claim is that Iran uses its wealth to fund terrorism instead of improving the life of its people. This is the main grievance in these protests if you look at what they're chanting and can at Twitter and it aligns perfectly with what comes next.   Remember the executive order which Trump just signed about corruption, human rights violations, freezing assets etc? Also remember that Trump did not certify Obama's Iran deal and it's up for review in January which begins tomorrow.  Now look at Trump's latest tweet: ""the USA is watching closely for human rights violations"".  The crackdown of these protests will be used to undo Obama's deal and trigger the punishments of the EO and impose new sanctions. This will fuel the protests further while starving Iran's proxies for funding.   This is at least the plan. What happens nobody knows. Let's hope Iran ends up free and a great American ally like before the Islamic takeover. They have great potential, people and culture"

"It has been the hardest year of my life; every imaginable negative thing that could have happened, did--as well as some unforeseen disasters. However, I'm not immune to the adage ""there are no atheists in fox-holes."" After a 20 year hiatus from religion--and more importantly, God--I have reached out to him, because for the first time in a looong time, I wanted to Believe again--to recapture the faith of my youth.    It was that, or succumb to depression and end my life. Twice in the early part of 2017 I was hospitalized for suicidal ideations. Depression in no joke. There seemed only one way to end the unyielding, relentless darkness that smothered all joy from my life. But I took a chance that God would maybe still care...and so I prayed again. Raw, honest prayer, begging for mercy. And the Lord took my hand and pulled me out--not that every day is perfect, but life IS improving.   Next week I begin working at the university again as a professor to all non-English-speaking foreign students. Not only is it going to help me change my life, but I see the opportunity to help a small part of the world understand America. This year I will be unapologetic, patriotic, and a shining example of western freedom to my students. Hopefully my new-found love of life can inspire them to embrace truth, justice...and yeah, the American Way.   Every day I get on T_D, you keep me going--you make me smile and sometimes laugh with your creative comments and hilarious memes--humor truly is the way to pierce the withering heart! I want to take your inspiration and make it my armor and sword for the up-coming year. I want to be righteous and good, loving and bold, unashamed and strong as Pittsburgh steel.   Thank you guys and gals for keeping this place SO ALIVE and Active--you have no idea how many folks you're helping. I can't wait to contribute some ""OC"" from within my classes this coming month! "
"Be brave. Do not fear ridicule and scorn. Do not be bullied by fantatical leftists. Do not worry about what their propaganda media say. Right is right. Evil is evil. And there's no question that the leftist agenda is pure evil. This country cannot survive if we don't continue bringing the fight to the radical left. Who cares about their labels they use to try and shut people up. These people are brainwashed and in all honesty, most are total monsters especially those in power and if Trump can endure the onslaught of insanity and sickness that has come at him for two and a half years, why can't we?  The left talks about being on the right side of history and I assure you, the Dem Party will evoke the same disgust that Communists, Marxists and Nazi Germany do now. We've seen what the left wants for our children's future, we can't sit idly by and watch them destroy it.  "

"And the black people that aren't brainwashed to be like that? They resisted the conditioning and brainwashing, so they're cool.  Modern ""Black Culture"" is about how cool you are, according to Black Culture's standards for cool. ""Real Hood Gangsta shit"", and all that. Rap and trap instead of better and more complex music. What you take from the country in benefits is a source of pride, because you're ""Cheating the system that keeps the black people down"", and the only virtues you have to signal are what Black Culture considers virtues. Plus ""I'm the biggest victim!"" stuff about ""The struggle"" of being pretty poor in a poor sucky neighbourhood. I could also add some stuff you already know about general immaturity and lack of culture and values, but someone might call that racist.

Fact is stranger than fiction.
"Mark Cuban. **“I can say with 100 percent certainty that there is a really good chance we could see a huge, huge correction,”** Cuban told CNN. **“That uncertainty potentially as the president of the United States — that’s the last thing Wall Street wants to hear.”**  Erik Jones. **“You would see incredible pressure on stock prices if Trump wins and everyone flooding into rare metals like gold and into bonds”** in the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom, Erik Jones, professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told Politico’s Ben White.  Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz. **“Given the magnitude of the price movements, we estimate that market participants believe that a Trump victory would reduce the value of the S&amp;P 500, the UK, and Asian stock markets by 10-15%,”** University of Michigan professor Wolfers and Dartmouth professor Zitzewitz wrote in a report that supposedly scientifically forecast the market’s reaction to Trump’s victory.  Andrew Ross Sorkin. The New York Times columnist and CNBC anchor wrote: **“In all likelihood, a Trump victory would lead to a swift, knee-jerk sell-off. Many investors will choose to sell stocks and ask questions later.”** In fairness to Sorkin he hedged his believe in the sell-off by writing: In truth, it’s impossible to predict how the markets would settle into a Trump presidency, despite the speculation on all sides. In all likelihood, it will take time for investors to truly make sense and “math out” how his policies would affect the economy.  Lawrence G. McDonald of ACG Analytics hedged also, predicting a massive sell-off followed by a relief rally. **“Trump will create a colossal panic, but the relief rally will be outstanding,”** he told Sorkin. Well, he got the rally right, anyway.  Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the IMF, a professor at MIT Sloan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and co-founder of a leading economics blog, The Baseline Scenario had perhaps the most panicked reaction, in keeping with his status as America’s most authoritative economists. **“With the United States’ presidential election on November 8, and a series of elections and other political decisions fast approaching in Europe, now is a good time to ask whether the global economy is in good enough shape to withstand another major negative shock. The answer, unfortunately, is that growth and employment around the world look fragile. A big adverse surprise – like the election of Donald Trump in the US – would likely cause the stock market to crash and plunge the world into recession,”** Johnson wrote on October 29, 2016.  Ian Winer, director of equity sales trading for the securities firm Wedbush, **predicted a 50 percent fall in stocks if Trump won.**  Bridgewater Associates. **“On Tuesday, Bridgewater Associates sent out a note to its clients predicting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could plunge nearly 2,000 points in one day if Trump is elected president. That would be the biggest one-day slump in stock market history, by more than double, besting the 777 point plunge that happened on October 29, 2008, at the high of the panic surrounding the financial crisis. The drop would translate into a 10.4% dive, and immediately send the stock market into correction territory,’** Fortune‘s Stephen Gandel reported.  Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup’s chief U.S. equity analyst. **“A win for Donald Trump in next week’s election could take a big bite out U.S. stocks, according to the latest forecast from Citi,”**   CNN Money reported. **“In a note to clients late Thursday, the bank said the S&amp;P 500 will fall by 3% to 5% immediately if Trump is elected. A victory by Hillary Clinton wouldn’t move stocks significantly, it predicted.”**  Macroeconomic Advisers. **“If Donald Trump wins the election, U.S. stocks (and likely many other markets overseas) will almost certainly tank,”**   Heather Long wrote for CNN Money. **“How big of a drop? Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisors predicts an 8% fall in the U.S. A new paper out Friday from the Brookings Institute projects a 10% to 15% nosedive. You get the idea.”** "

Remember LulzSec and them rearming the net in Egypt using unused lines? They aren't there.  The media is still dividing its attention on GEOTUS and the protests.  There are no journalists on the ground that can actually cover the events.
"Just logged into a forum I frequent, only to see that the newest comment is in response to a former account of mine there, by an account that has both my first and last name, a reference to my old reddit username (that I left for this one bc I was getting messages on it and public references to my real name), and my Facebook profile pic set as the profile pic. Refers to me as a ""Republican"" who is on T_D, and an ""asshole"".   I don't know what to do anymore. I'm in an extremely liberal field (classical music) and this stuff is like a deathblow to my barely-started career. I don't know what to do."

"As title asks? When liberals cry until they get what they want, why can’t he get a recount? "
"Just my hopes for what the New Year might bring, a summary of what might be the Happenings of 2018 based on what we read here at T_D.  No sauce, but if someone wants, I will link some of what I've seen here.  I'm not saying these will happen, but if they do, I think they would qualify as **HAPPENINGS**.  :)  SIX HAPPENINGS FOR 2018:   1-Trials Start For The Obama/Clinton Cabal Plot Against GEOTUS   Jan 15th, IG Horowitz gives his secret report to the Senate. Hopefully they will let us know what's in it by their actions.  The House and Senate committees seem to be on the verge of accomplishing something (as do Wray and Sessions), to act on the timeline of the Obama/Crooked cabal conspiring with FBI counterintelligence, CIA Brennan, and others to illegally prevent the other party from coming into power, and then continuing to try and overthrow GEOTUS. So we are looking at trials starting next year.  2-Pro-Trump Majorities In Both Houses   The midterms: We either go all Trump, remain where we are, or lose seats, maybe majorities. Duh. Things look good for us in general, so getting clear pro-Trump majorities is certainly possible, maybe likely :) Imagine the possibilities. Notice what GEOTUS' magic wand has already accomplished despite everything.  The 'resistance' is disorganized, weak and disarrayed. No leader since Crooked went down in flames, the various causes fighting for their own and eating each other, using PC standards to take down their own, money from Soros, donor class and foreigners way down and the DNC broke, and the MSM new business model of simply feeding the trump-hate addiction they created is going to burn out and they can't go back mostly. Politically, the Far Left with energy and numbers is fighting the establishment left with money and experience. They would need an anti-trump and the best they have is average Bernie who shot his wad and sold out.  3-US Economy Grows Enormously   The US economy is poised to become something the world has never seen before. The capital/credit is there, the trillion dollar infrastructure plan, the resources, the deregulation is huge, the skilled labor is there (barely), and the innovation/management. The business and consumer confidence is almost off the charts now. The 500 pound economic gorilla is putting on power armor.  4-European Countries Take Back Power From EU   European elections are happening starting with Hungary (our side wins) in March, and Germany is now a month past its deadline to call for a new election or form a coalition. Other happenings there too. Eastern Europe, see 3 Seas Initiative, might ally individually with America, while the EU becomes powerless.  5-The Middle East Peace Plan (v. Iran) Begins   The Middle East Peace Deal will happen, although Iran and its allies won't sign on. That's ok because everyone else will, and the purpose of the deal is to minimize Iranian nukes, terrorism and starting wars. The alliance against Iran includes America, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the rest of the Arabs and others. Iran will back down I think, or the regime falls, e.g. riots from today. **Without America doing any of the fighting or paying for it.**  6-NK Resolves (Either Caves Or Pulls Trigger) Allowing China-America Comprehensive Deal  North Korea's winter will be in full force with food and fuel gone for the slaves, scarce for citizens and maybe not enough for the army. If China does not save them again, Kim has to ask for a deal with disarmament or pull some trigger.  The deal with China is being run by the NK situation, but when that resolves, serious deal making on all fronts with big changes are looming next year.  This deal would have to cover ALL political and economical issues, and a deal is better than no deal since that costs more.  Biggest negotiation of our lifetimes.  7- Others  People might not think it important but I do: Our space programs, especially the private sector, are going to take off, and I hope big things will be announced.  Socially/culturally/PC war I don't think much will change. Roe v Wade won't be repealed, nor will pro-weed laws. Messed up parents will still inject 7 year olds with hormones, but patriots will be permitted to be patriotic. The best I think we can hope for is that the dividers lose their profit motives and things start calming down.  Kate's Wall will finally start and we'll be satisfied as long as there is steady progress.  The Islamic culture's invasion of the Western culture will slow down a lot as the countries of origin stop sending them and resistance to invaders builds up.  The term 'economic refugees' will be re-discovered.  HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR!  I THINK WE WILL! ======================="

"With the World powers put in place around that same time (EU,CAN) all wanting to bring refugees to their country and very very supportive of Islam.   Knowing Islam breeds 10x faster than the 2.5 American household. Its not rocket appliances to believe there is a global islamic takeover trying to happen.   The cucks doing this to our planet understand that time is important, they cant take over with their agenda overnight, they're aiming for generations to gain mass military numbers in key countries over time.   When Islam marries 10 year olds, and Americans marry around 20years. Its safe to say they are breeding twice as fast. That's only with one wife. "

- The fear of success 
Just throwing the thought out there but It's my personal belief that the UN is going to be the entity that will try to remove Trump from power through the us of subversion in order to get the leadership that is going to cooperate with thier world Islamic conquest.  It's going to start in Chicago and eventually build a beach head for a combined collation of willing Americans and foreign occupation by UN troops.   Now think back before Trump was president and there was that rally at Chicago that went full into full riot mode against Trump supporters and was a big red pill for normies that have thier head in the clouds. It's this kind of stuff that has me convinced that make Chicago that perfect place for a major event to unleash a giant revolt against the leadership of the country.   Now they need a leader who can fule thier efforts and that they can follow and that is where the UN comes in to lead the revolutionary force.  The media will try and convince fellow onlookers that the main reason the UN is even in Chicago is to quell the shear violence that is plaguing the streets but don't be fooled that is just a ploy to get their forces insides the country so they can expand out. Not to mention if Trump goes against UN intervention the media will easily turn the narrative around against Trump to make him appear like he is some kind of heartless human begin.

"Hi all, I just wanted to quickly give some background to my life. My parents were born in Iran, and came from well off families, with my mums dad being a Junior Minister of the Shah. However, when the Islamic revolution hit, my parents families had to flee Iran in order to not risk being detained or persecuted. My parents and their family decided to settle in Australia. My parents then met in University and married, which led to my birth.   Ever since I was born, every year I have travelled to Iran from Australia. I have witnessed the poverty, from the street beggers, to orphans being forced to sell gum in order to survive,  women being forced to wear certain clothings, to Government propaganda being on every street, it truly makes me sad to see the once proseperous country cripple under the Islamic regime.   The Islamic Revolutionary Guard have scared Iranians for decades, through placing them in the notorious Evin prison for unspecific amounts of time, to lashings, crane hangings and stoning of women. But Iranians are not scared anymore, and we realize that these dictators have caused so much hurt to the country that we must stand up.   Even though I don't agree with some of President Trumps views, I am grateful that he has publicly supported the protests and condemned the regime that has destroyed our country, unlike President Obama.   To President Trump and r/the_donald, thankyou for sticking up for us, and we truly appreciate the support you have given us during this period, and hopefully one day Iran can be a proud ally of both America and Israel.

"Originally I was going to tear apart the Wikipedia article on Populism but it turns out to be quite good, including even the cautionary-tale of *enantiodromia*, where populism can somehow magically turn into fascist leftist socialism if left uncheck, according to NYT in 2017, and ""followed to it conclusion"",   &gt; Populism is a path that, at its outset, can look and feel democratic. But, followed to its logical conclusion, it can lead to democratic backsliding or even outright authoritarianism.  *Now something I want to point out here is it's Left aligned NYT saying this. (on left aligned wikipedia)*     --- **Future Nazis?  Or Psychological Projection?**  Although it's good to always have the self-inspection of a *cautionary tale* (even better when they are ""literally Hitler""), it almost feels like bias and accusation from the obvious globalist newsrag being shoehorned into the Wikipedia article itself.  In fact, that's exactly what it is.  Effectively calling Populists 'future nazis'.    That's not scholastic btw, that's popular press which we already know is fakenews.  Meaning that this particular *cautionary tale* section of the Populism articles is the weak, death rattle of Carlos Slim's fakenews, inserting a pseudoscholastic, covert *dig*, a backbite at populism that's only going to fool people on the left, who still believe unquestioningly that Wikipedia is an unbiased source and not some kind of semi reliable globalist's mind-control *fauxcyclopedia*.   I'm saying that part is wrong.  It's incorrect.  Wikipedia is only 93% accurate.  Nice to have a cautionary tale against authoritarianism, but it misses the point of populism.    Which is this: Populism in a 2017 context has the aim of giving individual ***back*** their rights that were stolen by the globalists, including the right to free thought and expression.  People with rights and with free thought and expression are the *best people* to *resist* authoritarianism and fascism.  --- **What is Technopopulism**  In a 2017 context, populism is high value, and high information.  We have the Internet now.  We also have *redpilling*, meaning that in a way ***never before possible on Earth (as we know it in this timeline at least), people have nearly unfettered access to the sum of all knowledge, world history, facts, dogma, literature, great works of humanity, and any and all human thought and expression from the past that has been digitized***.  This level of access *should* create a type of diversity of thought never seen before.  So why hasn't it?  * Centralization of social media * Penetration of ""secrecy class interest"" into institutions, including most pertinently, all popular 'free' online services * Tight control over database interface for plebs (academic, library paywalls) * Penetration of ""secrecy class interest"" into everyday movements and expressions (social media censorship, 'unusual search results, strange interruptions when attempting to search for certain keywords')  So I found the socialist authoritarianism here, and it's not in the Populism article.  It's in the ""secrecy class interest"" itself, but I'll call it what it is: the rogue element of the CIA--the deepstate, the 'cabal'.  The 7th floor group and its affiliated do-badders.  It's the operatives in the US Military Intelligence who are strongly backed by coporate interests to effectively mind-control people into a particular worldview.  One could even say this is [""Worldview Warfare""](https://archive.is/cueVt) being done on the population, as an ""effective measure against Populism""  The ""secrecy class interest"" or *Globalists* as a shorthand have deployed 21 Trillion dollars (and more in DoD black money) to create an automated society.  That topic is too broad in scope and scale to discuss, but it has been discussed at length by myself, many times in the past.  It's sufficient to say that one can call them Globalists but it really doesn't hit the mark of what they are, which is: Technoneofeudalists or more commonly **Orwellians**.    I don't like the term Orwellian, because George Orwell--though a farsighted and prescient futurist--he had absolutely no idea of the extent to which his fascist technological system would be implemented and amplified.  Not only have we gone down that rabbit hole, as a society, our rabbits have made an vast, underground rabbit empire under our feet competitive with the overworld.  I'm saying that the technoneofeudalists have created a technological control grid that puts Orwell to shame.   And it's only getting more advanced by the day  So the opposite of a technoneofeudalist would be a movement to resist orwellianism and the technological control grid.  That resistance is already expressing itself as 'crowdsourcing', the 'wisdom of crowds', an internet-enabled populism, a crowdsourced truth movement, all under the umbrella of *technopopulism*.  The world has never before seen technopopulism.  Its an existential threat to the (new) 'world order', and that's why they are pushing so hard against it.  Using ""Populism"" as a pejorative around the world--pushing that as a narrative, is simply another example of media-based thought-control.  But they are overplaying their hands  --- **Trump**  Most Trump supporters aren't Trump supporters because they are resisting the Left.  They are Trump supporters because they've seen that whatever it is that the status quo is doing--that's not working.  Time for a change.  If the change doesn't work, we'll change it again.    And about those ""Nazis"" that we allegedly are, according to the confused Antifa left that on the face of it seems more charactologically nazi.   If 2017 has shown us anything, it's only the *statusquotarians* that devolve into fascism, and that's because they abidcate their personal choices to 'diffuse into a larger cohesive group in order to fulfill an ideal or set of ideals' (men must go, vanishing white men), because they hide behind this group as a human shield (#metoo), they give up personal individuation for group cohesiveness, they wear uniforms (pussy hats), etc  Famous Stanford psychologist of the infamous Stanford Prisoner Experiment, Phillip Zimbardo, explains fascism as the slippery slope of evil in [the Lucifer Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsFEV35tWsg), which everyone should listen to right now. It's extremely relevant to understanding 2017. (he also talks about the disappearing male in education)  Populism in the context of 2017 is ""restoring the Constitution"", and making America great again.  What's that mean?   It means recreating the America we though we always had but didn't--a Constitutional, Democratic Republic, where our thoughts matter and our voices matter and our VOTES matter  --- **Populism Corrects Corruption**  Where election fraud doesn't happen by Russians--whether or not they are Dimitry Alperovich working at the CIA's false front *Crowdstrike* or not--or whether those Russians are Pakistanis embedded in the Congress as spies.  Or whether those sneaky Russians are cyber hackers in Centreville, Maryland, being paid Chris Steele Dossier money to 'wiretap' Trump and his constellated transition team.  No, it's the technopulism of watchdog groups--Judicial Watch, Freedom Watch, George Webb, Crowdsource the Truth, many others--that's going to act as the Inspectors General of the problems with Globalist ""secrecy class interest"" and it's penetration of our Instittuions of Government, it's hijacking and mutation of the same, because we're finding through our daily redpilling that our government is nearly 100% corrupted, and has shown little interest in trying to self-correct.    Every day that you figure out a new connection between globalists and then post it online, every day that you come up with a meme that degrades their control, every day that write an article that exposes orwellian doublethink and antitruth propaganda, you are participating in technopopulism.  Because that wasn't something you could do 2 decades ago--we were isolated.  Now we're all connected, and this movement cannot be stopped, no matter how hard they try."
Mueller is dragging this on for the purpose of influencing the 2018 elections. Hope this backfires on them.
"Is it just me or are the folks over at r/poli**** incapable of critical thinking? Their posts are like ""uuuuggg, Trump didn't visit Canada!"" and ""uuuuggg Joe Biden will crush Trump in 2020 even though he touches children"".  Every response to a pro-trump comment is ""BLAGH UGHHH YOU NEANDERTHAL NAZI FOOL, I AM OF SUPERIOR INTELLECT AND DECENCY!""  What a bunch of loons. That Subreddit is a damn cult. "
"QUOTE:  Can we just stop looking for celebrity validation anyway? I really don’t give a shit about these people and would rather see actual content instead of “LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL LADYPEDE!”     first off, she’s really not beautiful.    Second, if we *knew* she was a Scientologist she was never “based” anyway. That should’ve been a dead giveaway.    Third, she’s not even like those random twitter assholes who get politically involved. She wore a trump dress *once* as far as I can tell.      But while we’re on the random twitter assholes, they need to stop too. Bill Mitchell, Lauren Southern, Cernovich, PJW, Hannity, Molyneux,  etc.    None of these people ever do *anything* and are just riding us for popularity. The fact is, we do not need them. Seeing a tweet where they “DESTROY A LEFTIST ��” doesn’t matter.     We used to get things done here before Trump was elected. Searching Hillary’s emails, Pizzagate research, Stonetear! I wanna go back to that instead of riding the dicks of people using us for money.    How about the fact that 2020 is only two years away and we still can’t get on the front page or /r/all? We have a ton of work to do.  END QUOTE 8"

"&gt;**Myth**: *In Greek mythology, the Golden Fleece is the fleece of the gold-haired winged ram, which was held in Colchis. The fleece is a symbol of authority and kingship. It figures in the tale of the hero Jason and his crew of Argonauts, who set out on a quest for the fleece by order of King Pelias, in order to place Jason rightfully on the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly*.  Contrary to popular belief, the Golden Fleece is actually a result of one of Trump's many time travel jumps.   He went back in time, got a hair cut, and the trimmings were sewn into a beautiful adornment.  &amp;nbsp;  Here is an actual picture of the [Golden Fleece](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/27qk.png)"
"So Al Franken is giving up his US Senate Seat, and MN Lt. Governor Tina Smith - a Dem - is slated to take over his seat. A Dem for a Dem, fair enough. But here's where things get tricky...  According the MN State Law, the MN Senate President must take over the vacant Lt. Gov. position. That Senate President is Michelle Fischbach - a Republican State Senator. When she takes over as Lt. Gov, she must give up her state senate seat, since she can't hold both jobs. That would trigger a special election for that vacant state senate seat.  The MN State Senate currently enjoys a 34-33 Republican Majority. If Fischbach leaves, it becomes a 33-33 tie. If a Dem is elected to the seat, that would shift the majority to the Democrats, who would then control the Senate and the Governor's office.  So somehow, Franken being a nasty groper could end up causing Republicans to lose their majority? That just doesn't seem right...  Here's the last kicker - Fischbach does NOT want to give up her seat! She is currently planning to run in the special election - for her own seat - and if she wins, she will resign as Lt. Governor.   How fucky is it that she has to do all that just to stay in her duly-elected seat and so that Republicans can keep their duly-elected majority? "
Does anyone that frequents this sub have any interest in having a meetup in order to discuss how to make Canada and America great again? And how to uncuck ourselves from the sjws and MSM?  Eligible cities for a Canadian meet up would include Montreal Ottawa Toronto Winnipeg Calgary Vancouver

"""I now choose to live my life as a gay illegal alien.  I was also drunk when I allegedly lied to the FBI so I cannot possibly be expected to be held responsible or convicted for my actions."""
That’s why we need to deport ALL of the illegal aliens and cut off the welfare spigot. 
"Minus 2, *that's how many genders there are*."
"If the GOP passes a status quo budget and doesn't SLASH these establishment, globalist departments (entitlements, EPA, IRS, Edu., etc) I will 100% SUPPORT President Trump taking a stand and NOT signing it. We don't give a flying fuck about some shutdown. We don't care if the fat cats in DC don't get their bloated paychecks. Shut it down. We want REAL CUTS. WE SUPPORT YOU TAKING A STAND."
"The left gets a small, minor victory. Blows it out of proportion, exaggerates and hyperbolates everything. Thinks ""This is it! Glumpdf is done!!!"" Only to have it blow up in their faces... this is all calculated to eradicate the swamp creatures from the administration and prepare to bring the hammer down just right so when calls for ""imprisoning political opponents"" come forth, they fall on deaf ears... actually they fall on ears of every American who's awake to the hypocrisy.   I don't know what EXACTLY is going to happen next. I only advise for now, you let them savor this little treat for it's about to turn sour for them. Let them brag on Facebook. Let them dance like fools. Just keep scrolling for we know what's about to go down... "

"The greatest thing about these wonderful tax cuts other than you keeping more of your hard earned money is that **no Democrats** voted for it! **Zero**.  Our next election will completely separate those who are *for* workers and those who are for lazy, entitled, America hating, illegal immigrants. The icing on the cake is all these Democrats will be called out for hypocrisy. If you think the tax burden should be higher then give more money to the government! MAGA!"
"Until the NFL makes a full reversal on the unpatriotic disrespect, we will not watch or attend any NFL function, game, or event."
"Trying to track it down, if anyone can help I'm running out of ideas to search for. it seems like Reddit's search only searches in the post, not the comments, and it was made in a comment.

Very powerful! Thank you
One Minute I'm Up-Trumping like a champ - next minute reddit's asking for my password... I can close the tab and re-open this dom-reddit and continue up-trumping no problem.  One way for reddit to push users off the site?? or maybe just my VPN?
"Not just the prime minister, but also the lady our president accidentally tweeted, who is more worried about a foreign leader's social media presence than actually getting anything done. Oh wait. She's British, so that mentality can be expected. "

On March 17 2016 an FBI laptop was “stolen” in NYC. Where does this fit in Hilarys email timeline?
He will continue to ruin the Democrats and back them into a corner. The dollar cost will be worth it in dividends. 
Seems like every new revelation on the swamp is brought to us by Judicial Watch.  I just found out they are a 501C3 charity.  That is like having the Swamp pay 40% of the cost to drain the swamp!  Time for a year end donation!  #MAGA
"Call any Dem Senators you may (unfortunately) have.  #Call Cucky Schumer about this.   He is the senate minority leader, he speaks for the entire party. If he flips Franken is **GONE**. Tell him how bad this looks for the democrats to shelter Franken and not Conyers, how you have no confidence in such a divided party.  Also important is Senator Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) has said Franken should resign, but Up-Chuck has not. Remind Chuckles that if the DNC can't even stand united in New York, how can you be confident it will stand united for America?  Make them eat themselves.  Office numbers are [here](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/office-locations)"
We must never allow the socialists to dictate our country's future.
"  So this 7-time felon who killed Kate Steinle is not even guilty of involuntary manslaughter (it was an accident), this charge requires the guy know he was handling a gun, which would mean he was negligent. He claims he picked up a tshirt, didnt know a gun was wrapped inside it and the gun just ""went off"" then he dropped it and kicked it into the bay   But the same jury found him guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The only thing they found him guilty of. But if he didn't know there was a gun in the tshirt, how can he be guilty of that? Someone help me understand this. "

Republicans this week:   Passed Tax Reform   Overturned Net Neutrality     Liberals:   Managed to find enough illegal votes to barely win against a pedophile at the ballot box
Have a look at some of the comments in this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7jtesf/the_battle_for_net_neutrality_is_over_the/dr91az6/  It's evident that these people were never around before 2015 to experience the Internet. But they'll sure lecture you on all the imaginary problems that never existed and how you should surrender the last bastion of freedom and capitalism over to the government so they can do what governments are famous for: depriving the rights of individuals.
They will never be able to tell why you never hired them. 
How have Obama (going on trips before/after trump) or clinton (taking money for gov favors) not been charged under the logan act yet?
"Very interesting to me that dozens of subreddits that are small and rarely get more than 1000 votes on a post all suddenly explode onto the front page with tens of thousands of upvotes, but only when there is a blatant political agenda to push.  And they all seem to be lockstep in pushing the same political message all at the same time. Very interesting."
"""This whole tax reform process has brought a few things to light that are truly telling about the Democratic Party. During this entire debate, they talk about YOUR hard-earned money as if it was the governments to begin with, and as if letting low and middle class Americans keep more of their paychecks is a bad thing. This ideology is frightening.  Further, I am getting sick and tired of the scare tactics being used by the left when talking about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I have been getting calls and messages from folks hearing they are getting Medicare, Social Security, or health care taken away. This is simply not true. Just because you disagree with a policy doesn’t give you the right to blatantly lie about it to the American people.  I have been trying to provide as much information as possible during this entire process, and I believe this article helps set the record straight on a few things.""   Liberals are having a fit saying ""It's only going to help the wealthy and not the middle class!"" Which is BS. Of course the media is manipulating everything to fit their agenda. Like with Trump on climate change. The media says he says climate change is a hoax, but he never said that. He's always stuck to man made climate change is a hoax. There's a difference. No one can deny real, earth cycle climate change.          https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/the-latest-tax-cut-lie-the-senate-bill-will-hurt-the-poor/  There's the link to the article I mentioned.

The title says it all my fellow Pedes! Passed 51-49!
"We see now that, largely, of the two groups the modern left courted (Muslims and ""empowered"" women), they choose Muslims. A move could be made on our part to try to pull some of those women who recognize that the very people who claim to represent them are importing those from societies which kill women for daring to leave the house without accompaniment. What that move is, I have no idea. Perhaps some of you do. "

"Can someone please explain to me (with links to government reports) how Russia is alleged to have interfered with the election?  So far, all I can find is 'facebook ads for fake news' and 'russian bots posting to social media.'    I have some questions:  1. How do we know the 'facebook ads to fake news' were to 'fake news' as opposed to legitimate news or editorials hostile to the Clintons?  2. How do we know the 'facebook ads to fake news' were Russian state sponsored as opposed to just Russians (or people with Russian IP addresses) trying to make some money?  2000 ads sounds like something a state actor wouldn't even waste time on.  3. How do we know the social media posts in question originated from Russia?  4. How do we know the social media posts in question were made by bots?"

"Illegal immigrant deported 5 times and previously convicted of 7 felonies, crosses the boarder illegally for a 6th time and kills an innocent American citizen in cold blood.

Atheist Liberals have completely undermined the will of the American people. They still fear us. We are armed and the votes are there.   The accusations should anger you. Slander is something you can never escape from. People always wonder.   The Atheists killed Scalia.   SCOTUS imposed gay marriage on to the land.  They are tearing down a Veteran memorial in Maryland.  They actually burn the flag in Berkeley.   Are we going to fight back?  My prayer to GOD is for forgiveness! God can restore our nation. President Trump shows us there is still hope for AMERICA.  Merry CHRISTmas
"Ty Cobb: ""Yes Jonathan, still believe shortly after the first of the year absent some unforeseen delay. People keep confusing that estimate with the Manafort/Flynn silos which will certainly continue to be active. My August estimate of when interviews would be completed was less than two weeks off, and that was despite the China trip which cost us 2 weeks, and half a dozen international crises. I am saying the interviews will be completed by the end of next week which I have said often and which has been quoted by 50 news outlets over the last month or more (with the caveat and understanding illness, Acts of God or logistical factors could add 24 to 48 hours). The Manafort inquiry has nothing to do with the White House as the indictment itself and the related public acknowledgement of Manafort's lawyer, make plain. And, we do not anticipate the long awaited Flynn indictment will delay the Special Counsel's conclusion of the inquiry into the White House. Just no there there."""
"And when I mean muscle, I mean they want to use these people as their own army. Soy boys know they can't fight and the sound of a gun gives them PTSD so yes, they need their votes today,   #but eventually they need them to take us out."
Don't use the language of the left.

I've seen estimates as high as 40% empty for the game today which had playoff implications.  The normal NFL season chatter from my extended family isn't happening.  One of the more popular Ravens discussion forums has been reduced to five or six people who only seem to be active on game days, and scream bigot at and ban anyone who suggests that the protests are affecting the league.

"Did the head cucks of the DOJ and FBI use the fake Steel dossier to acquire a FISA warrant to spy on our President. This is the key!  Demand answers Everyone in Washington knows.

They are trying to hit him from two fronts.   The elites are stringing everyone along for TV ratings and division. They know exactly what was done/given to the FISA courts to keep spying on Americans.  They are just trying to hide it, Because this is bigger than Watergate.  "

"Alright guys, if there is anything that I have wrong here, please let me know, but after much research, here is the timeline of what happened.  - During Obama administration, as secretary of state, Hillary pushes this uranium deal through. Somehow, the Clinton foundation ends up with $1.5 million and Bill gets another $500k for speaking.  - Aside: In 2016, the Obama administration chooses not to prosecute Hillary for the mishandling of emails.   - Mueller is later found guilty of collusion in aiding this Uranium 1 deal effort  - During the presidential campaign, the Clinton campaign pays the company Fusion GPS to produce a fake dossier, which attempts to falsely tie trump to the Russian government.  - Simultaneously, either the Clintons or DNC pay Ukrainian and/or Russian officials to dig up dirt on trump.  - Fusion GPS then goes on to submit this to a law firm so that they can keep this scandal secret and protected under attorney client privilege.  - The law firm passes on this fake dossier as a real document to a FISA (US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance) Court that insinuates Trump and campaign are colluding with Russia. This allows them to set up actual wiretaps of what's going on, specifically of then campaign manager Paul Manafort.  - Flynn admits to misleading to VP Pence and White house officials on discussions with Russia. This information was only found out because of the secret wire tap of the FBI/CIA, and they catch him in a lie. The information was used to set him up and flip him.   - Unfortunately, director Mueller can't act on it because its the result of ILLEGAL wire taps.   - Stzrok is found out to be an FBI agent who heavily favors Hillary Clinton. He's also the agent involved in questioning Flynn, but has now been dismissed due to his strong ties to the Clintons and democratic party.  tl;dr The Clinton campaign used the secret FISA courts and a self-fabricated document to literally spy on a private citizen (Donald J. Trump) during the election. Not only that, but the previous Obama administration would have had to be complicit in it. Are you f____ kidding me?    "

"Think about it this way; here’s what happens when a rich family with a ton of money purchases a yacht:     The factory creating the yacht had all of the investments that were used to create the company **taxed**; the loans made out to the company to purchase the materials were **taxed**; the purchase of the materials are **taxed**; the materials *themselves* are **taxed**; since most of the materials are made up of wood, furnishings, and ferrous metals, the gatherers (whether they be lumberjacks, miners, or finishers, or even robotic manufacturers whose creation was **taxed**) who prepared the materials have their upkeeps, investments, insurance, and income **taxed**; the company that produces the materials is **taxed** in numerous different ways; the transportation methods used to transport these materials are not only **taxed**, but the companies that transport them pay **taxes** on the fuel used to run the transport trucks and **pay taxes** on the trucker’s workman’s insurance and the trucker’s income is, of course, **taxed**; if the materials come from overseas, there are **import duties** that are paid to the federal government; once the materials arrive at the taxed yacht factory, the workers who unload the trucks and assemble the materials have their income **taxed**, along with the workers who construct the yacht using the taxed materials have their income and insurance **taxed**; if, heaven forbid, they get injured on the job, the payments made out to them are **taxed**, along with their medical assistance being **taxed**; the yacht itself is **taxed**; the transportation methods used to, literally, ship the yacht from the factory to the rich family’s expensive lake house are **taxed**; the docks of the house were purchased on **taxed** land and the docks themselves were built by a **taxed** construction company who used **taxed** materials and were paid with **taxed** wages; the family now has to pay **taxes** on the fuel to run the yacht; the fuel is provided at a marina by a **taxed** refuelling station, who purchases **taxed** fuel from fuel companies that paid **taxes** on the drills to drill these taxed fuels; of course, the transportation, along with the company that transports it, has **taxes** on the transportation, upkeep, wages, and clients that they transport the fuel to and from; and finally, the taxed fuel is pumped into the taxed yacht using a gas pump whose assembly was **taxed** and built by **taxed** people using **taxed** materials.     Did you count how many **taxes** there were in that?     The point I’m trying to make here is that many people believe that by *directly* taxing rich people and having them pay their fair share, they’re somehow correlating that this will increase government revenue that will be given back to the people. But in reality, **when you allow the rich and elegant to spend their buttloads of money on taxable items, you build a constant cycle of taxation that surprisingly creates a government surplus**.     It’s up to the government to use that money responsibly, not the rich people.     But instead, the government likes to spend that money on giant tubes that float through space and take pretty little pictures of galaxies and shit and spend less and less on housing opportunities for the poor.     When you enable rich people to spend more their money on items that create more government revenue, in a way, the government is sort of “investing” their efforts into these rich people who in turn spend like crazy and keep the bloodflow running faster. The government already has their hands in almost every single cookie jar there is. Why should we decrease the amount of growth opportunities for them?     By taxing the rich, you’re preventing the government, as well as the people, from keeping up to speed with the markets. The markets and the taxes need to be synchronised to run smoothly.     Tax cuts for the rich aren’t that bad of an idea.     I think the biggest solution that can be made is **increasing the taxes of foreign items that rich people like to spend overseas**. That will stimulate an American demand for American produced, and of course taxed, items.      Do you think rich people just sit on their money? Nope. The banks they put their buttloads of money in are taxed as well. These banks pay workers insurance, taxed light bills, taxed security, taxed FDIC, taxed interest, and taxed investment plans, along with many other taxes as well. "
"&gt; Cummings, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said the whistleblower approached the committee in June, but Mueller's investigators asked him to ""hold on the public release of this information until they completed certain investigative steps.""  &gt;""They have now informed us that they have done so,"" Cummings told Gowdy, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not respond.  Coincidentally Mueller's team ""just finished"" certain investigative steps and let   Cummings know he could go public.  They're trying to save the investigation now that everyone knows it's tainted.  SPEZ: The link: http://archive.is/wCk4y"

"Holy Shit. Ajit Pai came into my room with a pair of hedge clippers to sever my internet connection and I literally screamed at him and knocked the clippers out of his hands. He started screaming and swearing at me, and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to the FCC director, but I'm literally in shock from the result today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are Obama-era regulations losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want the government to regulate and fix this broken internet. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought it was polling well on Twitter???? This is so fucked."

"Does anyone else wonder where all the weapons and ammo went that was issued to strange organizations? There were thousands of automatic weapons, riot shotguns, and MILLIONS of rounds of hollow point ammo, that was issued to places like NASA, NOAA, IRS, and other orgs that had no business having weapons. Did the Blowbama admin store this stuff to give to their Marxist pantyfa clowns when all else they tried failed? Where are the weapons and ammo at now? BILLIONS were spent, but no trace of the gear. Hmmmm....."
"Then make sure the rest of his team is also from the left.  Tell them they have 90 days to find as much EVIDENCE as possible against Trump. (Even though they wasted that much time already, we have nothing to hide do we?)  Create a second special counsel of investogators from the right, and give them the same 90 days to find EVIDENCE against Hillary (they won't need that long).   Then let the house of cards come falling down."
"The media was prepping a coordinate hit op to try and Roy Moore GEOTUS. They were lining up all the players and getting them on record for sound bites that they could use to fuel more stories and on and on.  Then it's revealed they were lying DNC shills trying to get paid 750k to make up stories about GEOTUS and boom... just like after the election they are gone again. No more stories. No more soundbite solicitations. No more ""TRUMP MUST RESIGN"" agitprop. All back down the memory hole again.  Of course with these rats they are never truly gone, so we can expect them to pop up once or twice a year and try to attack Trump, only to get spanked back down into their holes by the great sword of TRUTH and JUSTICE wielded by GEOTUS."

"I have coveted a train of thought for some years now about the Nature of The Universe. My plan has been to establish my own lab and to dedicate my retirement years to pure R&amp;D. But lately, I have come to realize that I have more years behind me than I have ahead of me. And in the reality of mortality, and realizing that life is a limited time offer, I have decided to share my Universal Theory on social media.  There are some of you who have received a photo of a white board in which I demonstrate the math. I shared it with a select few who were spread far between, that I knew possessed the skills to understand the formulas. I did this so if I were to come to an unexpected demise there would be seeds planted. Today, I will use social media to explain the true nature of the Universe as I perceive it. Although I have the necessary Scientific and Mathematical vocabulary  to express these notions, I will use everyday language in an effort to get my points across to the largest possible audience. This will be a long post, best read without distraction and with time to dwell over the points in order to understand it in it’s totality. We of mankind, are not wired to think in more than a handful of dimensions. We think in terms of the Cartesian co-ordinates of X, Y, Z. That is  length, height, and depth. If we add the fourth dimension of Time, we now have the basis of perceiving movement or another name would be acceleration. So, we as a species, have the mental processing  instrumentation to perceive how big is the prey or threat, is it coming at us or running away from us, and how fast is it doing so. We also have the ability to combine, reflect on, and project an endless array of permutations of these elements. The perfect combination of perspective to succeed as the most advanced species in our environment. If there are other dimensions to be considered, it is impossible for us to consider, define and apply them to our way of thought. This is the great difficulty we face, the great barrier, the wall that we can not look over or pass through. The following is based on the work of giants, I am but a flea. It also depends on the acceptance of The Big Bang.  According to the Big Bang model, the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today. I think most people envision Galaxies, Stars, Star systems with orbiting planets, and other celestial bodies all spreading outward in all directions, all from one point of origin. They are correct. But in retrospection, it is far more detailed than that. It isn’t just stars, and planets, that are expanding from a central point in all directions. It means that every thing is expanding, every molecule, every atom, every particle, every sub-atomic particle. It means, in a manner of speaking, you, me, the dog, everything is “bigger” today than it was yesterday, “bigger” in a second than it was last second. Keep that in mind…everything is constantly moving away from the big bang. To do this as a human, simply accept it as a conceptional premise.  Now when  you step on an elevator in a high rise or skyscraper, press the down button, you may feel, for a split second, a bit lighter on the feet. You conceptualize this as “gravity”.  In a way that is quite astute. Remember, everything is expanding from the Big Bang central point. Everything. In that blip, your body senses this movement, which is happening at 32.2 feet per second. In fact, at any point, when someone exceeds 32.2 feet per second, in any direction, you can “feel” when you have exceeded the Big Bang expansion velocity. At a stand still, you are expanding at the same rate as all the rest of matter. Please keep that in mind, and go with the flow here. With these things in mind, Gravity can be expressed as the differential rate of acceleration of a specified body and that of the Big Bang expansion velocity. Please keep that in mind as well. There are those that argue Time is a man made construct. But Time is necessary, for with out it, Acceleration, Velocity, and Inertia can not exist. Time is not a construct, it is a dimension, just like the X,Y,Z coordinates of  the Cartesian set. Let’s examine this further. If one were to take a piece of Iron, put a film of Contact Cement on it, do the same to another piece of Iron, clamp them together, they become attached. That is because all three are expanding at the same rate as you, me, the dog and cat. But, replace the Contact Cement with a Magnet...and it doesn’t matter if the magnet is in between the two pieces of Iron, on one side of the Iron, or the other, they remain adhered. Remove the magnet, they fall apart. Remember, with out time, you can not have velocity, acceleration, or inertia.  Instead of acting like Contact Cement, where all three are expanding at the Big Bang velocity, instead, the two pieces of Iron stay together because they lack any velocity as opposed to all else in the same relative space. Here’s the kicker…. That is because, Magnetic fields reside outside of the Dimension of Time!                . "

"So I follow a number of politicos on twitter, and I was recently informed of a GOP strategerist (lol) Rick Wilson.

"[Luke 2:39-52 KJV] And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.   Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.   And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.   And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."

"I went to the UPS store to send a toy to Ryland Ward who survived the Texas church shooting but lost his parents. (My little guy drew a whale on the card just for Ryland.) A well-dressed man in his early 30s asked the clerk for stamps. The clerk asked him which kind. He said ""anything but the American flag"". And he ""wanted to make a political statement"". Now, I live in a very blue neighborhood. I know cucks are everywhere and I'm generally not confrontational. I'm not sure where it came from but I was angry. ""It's not right. You are an American. If you don't love this country, leave."" I said. He looked at me ""were you even born here?"" (I'm a naturalized citizen, but how could he know?) ""I was born in ___, and it took me 10 years to become a citizen. I love America. Do you?"" ""You must love Trump too."" ""It has nothing to do with Trump. You are American. You enjoy everything this country has to offer. There are people risking their lives for you to live your life like this, and you don't even appreciate it. If you don't love this country, leave. Go to North Korea."" ""You are so arrogant.......I have been to xxx, xxx (countries)"" ""You bet I'm arrogant. It took me 10 years to become a citizen and I love this country. Unlike you. You don't love America....do you even love your parents?"" At that point he just rushed out and said Merry Christmas. I said, Merry Christmas! (A bit shaken but giddy because we said ""Christmas""!)  After he left, an mid-aged lady in the store told me ""I completely agree with you."" I thanked her.  People like that man is really cancer in this country. I feel very proud calling him out. Hypocrites and brats need to be called out and I hope he embarrassed himself enough that his girlfriend, who was silently by his side during this entire encounter, dump him in no time.  "
"I know the narratives that are out there for the reason Roy lost. There is no doubt in my mind there was some shady vote tampering going on with all the write-in votes.  But to look at that at this point in time is to ignore the larger issue.  Ignore the Democrats for a second. Ignore all their tricks and all their bullshit. Take a good long look in the mirror.  Ignore McConnell and all the bullshit with Mo Brooks. Ignore all of it and look at just the vote.  Last I read, only 51 to 52 conservatives in Alabama voted. They stayed home. They held up a self righteous principal that they did not want to be lumped in with Roy Moore.  If we are being honest, it actually has nothing to do with the sex allegations which only 5 to 7% of potential voters felt they had an impact in their decision on who they voted for.  No. What really happened is that a lot of Voters in Alabama decided they were not going to vote at all. A protest refusal to vote because neither candidate fit their ideological desire.  This is nothing more than a failed ideology. People in Alabama are pro-life and yet their refusal and protest got them a communist abortionist as their representative. That is where their alleged protest morals got them.  This is the lesson that needs to be shouted loud and clear.  I don't care if Steve Bannon himself bitches about a republican potential candidate. Steve Bannon is 0 for 1 as a king maker. Whoever the candidate happens to be, if you want to help president Trump, get off your damn lazy stubborn ass and vote for the Conservative candidate.  Instead of trying to second-guess all of Trump's tweets, when he endorses someone, leave that when Trump addresses the American people he is telling the truth and go out and vote for that person.  Trump endorsed Luther strange. He was not an ideal candidate for Steve Bannon and had ties to Mitch McConnell. Trump endorsed Luther anyway. Trump would not do that with someone he felt he could not work with.  Instead, we overthought it and thought it some sort of 4D chess jiu jitsu to use as leverage against Mitch when all it did was get us to have Roy Moore on the ticket, who apparently not enough people in Alabama supported, something president Trump blatantly noted in his tweets when he endorsed Luther.  If our movement is going to succeed in transforming America, we have to grow up and stop overthinking ourselves. We all know Trump does do tweets that have strategic value, but we voted for this man and need to put faith in him that when he addresses the American people with his wants and desires that he is being forthright with us and directing us and leading us to where he wants us to go. We need to cut the bullshit and stop trying to guess what he really means or what he really thinks when he is bold-faced telling us what he wants.  If we do not stop the self-destructive behaviors, Trump will lose 2020. and it will be because of idiots like us who never could take what he was saying directly to the American people at face value.  We elected Trump to lead. Trust him to do that and when he imparts advice to the American people fucking take it and get off your ass and vote."

I figured I would remind any sports loving patriots about the game today.  
Deep State operatives in the FBI wanted to force a recusal of Sessions so they opened a fake review/ investigation on him? And once he recused they immediately closed it down with the finding that everything was in order. Looks like the smear / hitjob / coup attempt / whatever you want to call it / leaks were planned out from the start. They knew they had no chance if there was any supervision so they they tried to manipulate the system into a recusal. 
"# Taqiyya: advises Muslims to lie and deceive kuffar (infidels aka non-believers) to advance the spread of Islam and conquest of the world. Sometimes you have to step backwards (retreat) to advance further ahead (in your conquest)  Never ever trust someone who's ideology says you are a filthy subhuman kuffar, and it's totally ok to lie to you to promote their religious agenda (turning the entire world into a Caliphate). Don't forget they are still using slave labor to build their extravagant cities in the desert. They treat their women as female properties. They jail and kill gays. They jail and kill women who have been raped. They marry young girls so they can legitimately rape them. If you smuggle somethings related to another religion, they will arrest, jail and eventually kill you. They have been using their petrodollars to promote Islam in the West (mainly Europe) and helped bribing corrupt politicians to build thousands of mosques around the world. Let's not make the same mistake as Eurabia. It's time to show them their ideology invented by a pedophile, misogynist, sex slave master, blood thirsty, schizophrenic warlord has no place in the modern world."
So the Trump hating FBI agent seemingly behind every coverup involving clinton and every wrongful persecution of Trump people was secretly porking his coworker. Is the FBI saying that is NOT against their sexual policies at work? Why isnt he fired for that alone?  Ironically he is now working at Human resources who theoretically should be enforcing sexual relations policies between employees.

"After Sarah's comments today, there is some serious hunkering down by corrupt journalists. Chris Cillizza on twitter‏ for example, is trying to pretend how offensive and appalling it is that Sarah said they're pushing an agenda.  If anyone has a list of say the last year of actual news stories that were pushed, whether on twitter or publication on their websites, of ""news"" with unknown sources, or the so-called ""Anon WH sources"", that were wrong, it would be good if we could get everything compiled together. Especially agenda's pushed by so-called ""unbiased reporters"".  Examples include, ""hands up don't shoot"", which CNN actively pushed and supported. False reporting like, ""Trump didn't visit Scalise"" that Acucksta pushed. If they're going to double down, it would be nice to start pushing large master lists of agenda's/false reporting on twitter, facebook ect., especially since many Trump supporters aren't active here, but are on twitter/facebook and will retweet and republish these types of things to start flooding journalists who proclaim they're unbiased news sources."

"I, for one, and very happy to have a president who is finally pushing back against the swamp.  We haven't had this in decades, and it's not a pretty or easy business.  Every time I hear of someone feeling uncertain about the tweets, or thinking he should stop or reduce them, I remind them that this is what pushback looks like.  It's not comfortable, and it's not pleasant.  But, and I think we can all agree, it's necessary.  Tactics like ignoring the opposition or extending an olive branch do not work with leftists.  They need to be constantly put on the defensive, which they haven't been in 30 years.  Every time our POTUS tweets or makes one of his classic remarks, I'm happier and prouder than ever to have cast my vote for him twice.  I admire him for his character and his absolute fearlessness to call them out for what they really are: disingenuous, hypocritical liars.  I love the way he has emboldened the people, not only of America, but all around the world.  So remember, pedes - this is what pushback looks like, and this is what we need."
"So SJW's draw their authority, and power in 'fighting' for others.    Fighting for their 'rights', or 'supporting' them with virtual signaling, or showing up for a protest, or posting some PC bs...  The SJW derives their authority and POWER in DEFENDING someone other than themselves.  They gain moral authority for showing that they will stand up for someone else.   They couldn't have any authority or power if they stood up for themselves.  I'm thinking of throwing this back at them.  Asking them, ""what are you doing for YOURSELF to protect YOUR rights (or whatever the hell it is) ""  I'd like to hear my other pedes thoughts on this.  "

"[Excerpt taken from the developers of the game ""Make America Great Again: The Trump Presidency"" on the Steam store.]  &gt;Matt Furie DECEMBER 14	- CAVALRY Matt Furie, the owner of Pepe the Frog (a poorly drawn cartoon frog that was hijacked and popularized many years ago by the internet, then came to public prominence during the Trump election) had a lawyer file Copyright claim against all Pepe the Frog uses on Steam.  &gt;Apparently, even though our Rare Deplorable commando frog and Donald Toad emoticon (CLEARLY a toad and not a frog!) are our own original art &amp; characters, just filing the claim means Valve must take them down.  &gt;If we sign a thing that says the Furie one can sue us and not them then Valve will put it back up. At the moment we're not going to sign that because going to court is...bad even if we're right.  &gt;I guess Ol' Matty boy thinks he owns all cartoon frogs now or something...oddly enough his 'Pepe' looks a whoooole lot like Kermit the Frog to me.  &gt;Unfortunate!  Link to the Storefront: http://store.steampowered.com/app/515040  The devs actually asked Matt before releasing the game if they could use Pepe because he was such a huge part of the Trump election, at which point Matt apparently let out a shriek of 'REEEEEEEEEEEE' and freaked out.  Instead they made a 'Donald Toad' character and a frog commando."
"Michael Horowitz (D) was appointed by Obama in March of 2012. Something tells me he's another clown associated with Robert Mueller, Weissmann, Rosenstein, Goldstein, Rhee, Strzok, Page. Can we seriously expect something positive to come out of his ""inspection?""    I fully expect him to say in the next few months, ""Nope, nothing to see here folks. Move along."""
"Over the past few years I have noticed more and more of a positive spin on China in the Cinema. Arrival, Looper, The Martian, and others get down on their knees to praise Communist China who is portrayed as the savior of mankind, the economic powerhouse of the future, or just philanthropic angels. Additionally, more and more Chinese characters are being written into modern movies that ad nothing to the plot. In rogue one, there were 2 popular Chinese actors written into the movie (I am the force, the force is one with me and Mr. Big Guns) that added nothing to the plot. I feel that ""Rose"" from The Last Jedi is more of the same.  The reason studios are bowing to their will and self censoring for Chinese audiences is that China only allows a set number of foreign films in each year, and competition for these slots is intense as it is a huge market. This results in movie studios adding Pro China plot points, and ramming in only Asian Actors of Chinese decent when Asian actors are called for, or adding them in with no plot points in mind. "

I am a strong defender of the police and the 2nd amendment, and this doesnt change any of that, but we shouldnt deny that there is a problem here. A man is dead. Another man shot him. I know that police work is life threatening at times. I know cops have been killed at traffic stops. But this man was shot 5 times as he fucking cried for his life. Cried. Sobbed. Begged. I don't think our cops should not carry guns. In fact I think they absolutely should. But this kid fucking killed a man because he reached for his belt while he begged for his life.

"For clarity to anyone curious, and where this talking point comes from:    The FCC has 5 members, and is split in a partisan manner with 3 members of the party in power, and 2 members of the opposition party.   When a Republican seat opened up during his term, Obama appointed Ajit Pai.  He was promoted from FCC member to FCC chairman by Donald Trump, shortly after he was sworn in.  Suck it libtards."
"I feel great about president Trump, in fact I feel better now that he is president than I did when he was just running for election. It may be hard for you to understand from afar, (when all you read is very biased news), as opposed to me- living and working here and being able to appreciated the truth first hand. But many others agree with me, even some who did not initially support Trump. If the election were held tomorrow it would be a landslide win for Republicans!"
"Most of the abuse on the Internet has come from monopolisitic content providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. Information is filtered by these corpoations. Google could single handedly erase an event from history because so many people don't read books and just use Google.  Broadband providers like Comcast were already being regulated by the FCC in a way that protected consumers for decades. Before 2015, Comcast tried throttling BitTorrent traffic, but the FCC stopped it because ISPs were always subject to the concept of net neutrality for consumers.  Then, in 2015, Obama's FCC expanded protections to large corporations like Netflix and Google. This meant larger profits for these corporations, higher Internet bills for you, and an affirmation of the Obama administration's support of Internet censorship by not classifying big social media as Title II **(even though they control the free flow information just like ISPs)**.  Trump then came along and said it's ridiculous to give huge corporations the same protections as comsumers, moved Ajit Pai (hilariously appointed by Obama) to his position in the FCC, who then repealed the Obama regulation.  Keep in mind that getting rid of this regulation helps small busineses on the Internet because they are low bandwidth and do not engage in peering agreements with ISPs. The regulation only helped high bandwidth coporatations using a disproportionate amount of bandwidth.  There are people so brainwashed that they would legit murder Ajit Pai over an issue they don't understand. They would be assasinating somebody at the defacto direction of multibillion dollar corporations lmfao."

"I volunteer in my son's High School about 3 hours a week, and my daughter brings all her junior high homework to me nightly, so I feel I have a pretty good insight on the serious lack of substance in the Common Core Curriculum. Common Core needs to end immediately. It is designed, first of all, to completely excise parents from their children's education, by being so mysterious and strange and never having directions so that parents have a very hard time helping their children. Beyond that, it is a lot of nonsense, liberal propaganda, and unintelligent blabber. We need to return to a classic style of Education, based on grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The classic education studies great thinkers throughout history and provides people with a solid foundation with which to reason,  leaving them unfazed by poor arguments. This is the only way to truly and permanently turn our nation around, with rational thought!"

Trump should order from Dan Coats to Mike Pompeo to Jeff Sessions to whoever else he can find to put together an assessment immediately and release it publicly whether the leadership of the FBI interfered and meddled in the 2016 election. And to write an assessment whether they had a clear preference for Hillary and whether they took actions designed to get her elected.
He was a Politician in Washington when the Rapist Bill Clinton was in charge. Never called for him to step down then proceeded to support that same Rapists Wife for President after they rigged the election against him.   With all the Fake News out there not one story has emerged about Trump getting Blow Jobs under the Oval Office desk from interns. 
"Most definitely, these accusers will now disappear into the wind, because their jobs are done. Now, the fake news cucks will just segue into talking about the Trump accusers to slander him, because literally every single other talking point failed. What we can hope is that every other candidate from now on will stand up to these fake accusers, put their foot down, and say:  “Fuck you. I haven’t done a fuckin thing.”"

"Yeah, they abstained along with Canada and 33 others, but why didn't they vote no? I get it that Canada is cucked and doesn't want to piss off all the jihadi's they've imported, but unless abstaining in the UN has a stronger meaning than I think, what gives Poland? :("
"To put that into perspective, that’s $26,865 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. So if you’re a family of 4 Obama spent $107,463 for your family. What did we get for that? As someone in the heart of the middle class, I didn’t see any of that money. In fact, I’m worse off financially than when he took office. Who got all this money?"

"Seems like the GOP establishment want to lose and use that to get past President Trump's first 4 years and hope he loses in 2020. They want Trump to fail and they want their DC jobs to become cushy again so they can keep being corrupt.  They don't care who is in charge, they just want an establishment hack puppet in the oval office.   Feel like even state chapter of GOP are sabotaging candidates.  Trump needs to get his people, like Lewandowski/Conway (let he her go from WH)/Gorka/Bannon, etc out to campaign for individuals that Trump picks.  He needs to stop trying to work with the GOPe.  "

Now that we have some facts about what happened we would like to share them and make them more visible.   **Known Facts:**  - #[NTSB has confirmed Train 501 was going 80MPH in a 30MPH zone.](http://www.king5.com/article/traffic/3-killed-dozens-injured-in-amtrak-crash-near-dupont/281-500303305)  - #[Amtrak confirmed that Positive Train Control, an automated system that makes trains slow down, was not in effect on Train 501 today.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/train-derailment-seattle/548660/)  - All but the following engine jumped the tracks. 13/14 cars.   - 5 vehicles were struck by the train.  - Two additional semis were struck by the train.   - There are fatalities but cannot confirm how many. Rumor is 6.   - This was the very first run of this train and this service line.   - This service line was supposed to be an improvement upon turns that were too sharp for trains to go fast on.   - A Local Mayor campaigned against the train's current set up with a group that were urging the speed is was set to travel at was too high.   - That fastest section of track was rated for 79MPH which is already pretty generous; according to most sources. According to the following bullets the speed for the section the crash occured on was only 40MPH.   - [***The train at time just before derailment was clocked traveling at 81.1MPH.***](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/amtrak-train-derails-south-seattle-51861721)  - ~~[Google is reporting the crash was here.](https://imgur.com/a/yxkyf) This is incorrect.~~ Google has corrected the placement of the crash.*  - The crash was [here.](https://imgur.com/a/49qKH)   - [This stretch was on the blue line labelled here headed Southbound](https://imgur.com/ovUL1Ib.jpg).   - [Which means the train was going far faster than allowed according to WSDT.](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/Rail/PNWRC_PtDefiance/Map.htm)  - Passengers reported rocking before bucking, which means the train leaned off the track from momentum rather than suddenly hitting something.   - Some passengers now reporting a bucking as well, which contradicts earlier statements. This would support suddenly hitting something or jumping the track rather than rolling off of it.   - The train took a trial run just this past week without issue and the first real run was this crash. If there was an obstruction on the track it would have had to have ended up on the tracks very recently.   **Rumors/Most Likely Irrelevant Information:**  - AQAP published more tips about how to derail trains in the August 2017 issue of Inspire. They've been doing this for years and AQ has been threatening to derail trains for decades. This is not new and its not likely that they suddenly started acting on it on a train that's never run before. Possible, but not likely.   - An ANTIFA affiliated webpage had a post talking about putting concrete on train tracks to stop movement of oil related materials. This was posted on 20 April 2017. This is most likely not related at all.   - The ANTIFA Twitter that ""endorsed"" it is a troll account.   - Other than the State of Washington and the existence of trains there is absolutely nothing to indicate ANTIFA is related at this time.   Please keep hearsay to a minimum."
My god does ted Cruz sound like a beast giving his speech rn
"This tax bill is really about helping businesses.  What you and I got are just bread crumbs.  The meat of this tax bill is about businesses.  I don't think most people understand that.  The 40% reduction in the corporate rate and the ability to expense 100% of new capital in the first year are game changers.   This will cause an explosion of hiring, wage gains, and demand for workers.  We are already seeing it.  So, I suggest you always be looking for a new job with better pay because companies will be heavily competing for your services.  Trump also removed incentives for companies to move overseas and put penalizes for transferring assets to lower taxed countries.  America is back!  Edit: forgot to mention that Trump put a one time rate of 15% on repatriation.  A large part of the $2.5 trillion overseas will now come back in."

American liberals love welfare for illegals and they love foreign aid. They however hate Tumps tax cuts. They are literally for everyone getting more money except hard working Americans. WTF?
Dead people only vote democrat.

They cannot win on ideas so they go for character assassination. When is America going to learn?
Pat Sajak is apparently a complete fucking boss. He says exactly what I think and still works in shiwbusiness!
It's too bad removing the SALT deduction doesn't remove liberal salt.
"This is the first report you will see of this since I have insider information and it literally just happened.  It will be reported that he resigned. I'm sure we'll be seeing articles about it and liberal outrage soon enough! People at the highest levels of Drexel have been working to get rid of him for the past year, but there is a process and his departure has finally been negotiated."
"After taxes, the $1000 bonus we received today is $919.  Thank you President Trump and AT&amp;T! "
"Between STRZOK's edits, how about some cross referencing communications and phone calls, to see who else was in on the spezs. Does non-burn phones like at the DNC/DOJ/ClintonCamp have burn phone incomings?"
"After the past couple of weeks it looks like this is a plan to expose &amp; get rid of the corruption within the DOJ &amp; FBI . Just look at the people Mueller selected for the special council . So you gather them all together, you dangle the bait in front of them ( Russia Collusion ) &amp; you watch them go at it like a shark with blood in the water . It's pretty genius actually . Mueller's the guy that brings all these people together to construct the house of cards , then when you start to pull the thread it all becomes linked - Strzok , Page ,McCabe , Comey ,Ohrr , Fusion GPS . What do all these people have in common ? CROOKED HILLARY .  Are you starting to see what I see ? "
It's very disheartening to see the amount of brainwashed individuals.  Trump has done more good in less than a year than any President in my lifetime.  Will voters realize this come 2020? 
What witchcraft is this!?!?!
"Despite California Gov Jerry Brown's squawking about Global Warming being the cause of the fires, the current fire is only Californias 3rd largest in history (6th when he said it) proving no relationship."
Who do you think out of the MSM “media personalities” are Soro’s puppets versus those who really aren't evil - just drawn into the hype because they think its trendy to bash POTUS.    
"The ABC radio news segment they had at the top of the hour, just had a report where the reporter asked voters on Bama, and they were women, who said ‘ Nobody in Alabama believes the lies about Moore’  Reporter went on to say ‘Turn out is higher than expected at 25%’"

"We haven't gotten any direct raises or bonuses but we've spent more on Christmas this year and given more to charity. And it seems everyone is extremely 'merry' this year, despite it being a tough year at work where everyone was stretched thin and overworked a ton of hours. I feel like the whole country is feeling the cheer (you wouldn't know it on social media, however!)."
I wonder if there's more to the story
"It's not big, and I am not important, but that is why this matters SO MUCH. It's indicative of a larger problem and I believe we all know what that is. I posted on the_congress the other day asking about help getting involved. Exact quote:  &gt; I contacted my US district rep, my AZ legislative district rep, the GOP party chair of AZ, ASU young republicans, multiple gop candidates campaigns and no response... soo what now? Ill go shout or values from the rooftops at the ASU Memorial Union if I have to but there must be some place I can do orginized help  I got 2 views, no responses or votes, and never saw it on new even though I refreshed alot. It may be an anecdote, maybe it slipped between the codes, but I'm starting to believe it was hidden"
"Please President, this is long overdue. "
"But really, he loves his family and wouldn't cheat on his HOT wife. Even when offered women in Russia, he'd just laugh off the temptation."
"I made the mistake of hiring him to work on my house (I met him in church!)I was nice(not overt) to him. Afterward I would see him at weird places while doing errands. This man stalked me daily. The only relief I got was when he was in jail or trying to get back. He laid in wait for me to get home, then would yell at me outside the door. He threatened me repeatedly(to cut) my son &amp; his friends. It got to where I was afraid to leave the house. Most of the time when I called the police he would run. He wouldn't come in my house because of my 135 pound Akita Rolex. I did move from the city &amp; house I'd lived in for 25 years. He followed me. Not sure how. Maybe the church. He started all over again. Then I met SGT. G'Dad (Retired Military Police &amp; Medic. 2 of his MOS""s Really amazing dd214's) He found him, took the detailed notes I've been keeping (a hell of a lot more happened) made a citizens arrest then delivered him to the Sheriff's office. He's never been back.  God bless SGT G'Dad.  Just thought I'd pass this along.  Luv G'Ma   P.S. this was all during Obama's reign of terror on the American people."
"[Matthew 3:13-17 KJV] Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?   And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.   And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

"##**They're coming for you!**   ***        &gt;30 Dec 2017 02:44:28 UTC     &gt;The Honorable Paul Ryan The Honorable Nancy Pelosi   &gt;Speaker of the House House Minority Leader   &gt;H-232 The Capitol H-204 The Capitol   &gt;Washington, D.C. 20515 Washington, D.C. 20515      &gt;Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi,      &gt;We write to you to address serious concerns regarding the integrity of investigations currently being undertaken by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). Improper release of information to the media by committee members or staff is a serious violation of committee and House rules. Significant evidence that serious leaks have occurred in relation to the HPSCI investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election must be immediately addressed. **Members or staff who may have violated rules by leaking sensitive information to the press or other outside entities must be promptly removed from this investigation and proper inquiries undertaken without delay.**       &gt;Our serious concerns center around but are not limited to the leaks of privileged information by HPSCI members and/or staff to the press regarding an interview of Donald Trump, Jr. that took place on December 6, 2017. Under committee and House rules, the details of this non-public interview were not to be released publicly unless the committee voted to do so. Even with such a vote, the rules still allow for a witness and his or her counsel to review the transcript before public release. On December 7, as the committee’s eight hour interview of Donald Trump, Jr. was still underway, information from this closed session of the committee was clearly being leaked to the press. This is evidenced in multiple tweets and online articles that contained privileged information that only members or staff present for the interview would have been privy to. The leaking of privileged information continued after the interview had concluded.    &gt;These serious violations need to be investigated and any members responsible for such violations must no longer serve as part of this investigation. Any staff who have violated committee or House rules must also face appropriate disciplinary action. The integrity of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is of critical importance to the whole House and to the nation we are all tasked with serving. Your immediate attention to this matter is needed to ensure that the credibility of this body is not at risk as it undertakes investigations and handles sensitive issues of importance to the United States. We thank you in advance for your prompt reply,    &gt;Sincerely,     &gt;Congressman Lee Zeldin (R, NY-1), Congresswoman Mia Love (R, UT-4) and Congressman John Ratcliffe (R, TX-4)      &gt;https://zeldin.house.gov/sites/zeldin.house.gov/files/201712181039.pdf"

Black people in democratic cities and states are worse off now then ever before.  There's less jobs due to living in unsafe environments (thanks to no policing) and liberals claim we cannot ignore each other's skin color.  (MLK is rolling in his grave).  Implying black people that go on to live successful lives and have nuclear families are Uncle Toms.    Face it, liberals would love it if black people became the most helpless and dependent race on the planet as long as they're guaranteed their vote into office.  They don't care about black people.  They never have. And they never will.  And don't use the excuse that there is no way people like Al Sharpton aren't supporting black people's interests.  There's plenty of white reporters on CNN and MSNBC that hate white people more than they anything.  Al Sharpton is a rich ass dude who rakes in big dollars for parroting democratic ideals.  He can parrot all he wants, the statistics support conservative control would be far more beneficial to urban black communities in comparison to democrats."

"Even if I don't fully buy into it the theology their message of being kind, the commandments, and other core values are worth considering going.

Winning! Comeon Mr. President!!!
"*SPOILERS, if you care*.  So I just watched The Last Jedi and these are my thoughts.  I'll start with some positives. It was generally an improvement over the abomination that was The Force Awakens (not difficult). The story was original and not just a rehash of A New Hope. The action was decent. Rey actually had somewhat of a character arc and Kylo Ren is actually a decent villain now. If you don't think of it as a Star Wars movie, it is not a bad film.  The bad. In a nutshell, wasted potential, beloved characters butchered and even more obvious pandering to the left and SJWs.  So let's start with the main draw of the film: Luke Skywalker. Luke's character was completely ruined. Apparently this whole problem is because Luke sensed evil in Kylo Ren one night and in a brief moment considered murdering his own nephew, which is what cemented Kylo Ren's turn to the darkside. Yep it's all Luke's fault. The man who resisted the Emperor and had unwavering faith in his father in ROTJ apparently considered murdering his own frickin' nephew one night. Come on, really?! The hero of the original trilogy is now a probably smelly hermit, living on an island, drinking alien tit milk (yes that happens!).  Rey has about two lessons with Luke and somehow that's all she needed to become a master. Chewie, meanwhile, was reduced to playing with annoying alien birds the entire time that are obviously only there for disney to sell more toys.  Finn and some slightly chubby, homely looking, short-haired dorky asian chick named Rose have a mostly boring filler adventure. The only somewhat interesting thing about it was a redpill dropped about a wealthy elite profiteering off the galactic war by selling weapons to both the empire and the rebels. Unfortunately nothing was done with that. Seriously? You basically introduce the Star Wars equivalent of the Bilderberg elite / military industrial complex you do nothing with it? That should have been the movie!  Mostly their story was just for Finn and Rose to develop romantic feelings for each other. Obviously this is to pander to fat, unattractive feminists and tell them that yes you are entitled to an attractive man. No need to get on that treadmill!  Which leads me to my main point. This movie is total feminist, pro-diversity, anti-white, anti-male propaganda.  The good guys are a very diverse bunch. People of all races, genders and alien species amongst them. The bad guys meanwhile, aside from Captain Phasma (who still does fuck all considering how hyped her character was prior to Episode 7, ""OMG female stormtrooper in cool, not sexualized armor!!1""), are all white men.  The only white, alpha male in the entire movie is Poe Dameron. Ace pilot and sexy maverick. He spends the entire movie being toxically masculine and getting shown his place by the strong wahmen: General Leia and - get this - a literally purple haired nobody who's name I didn't even bother to remember.  So near the beginning of the movie all the rebel leaders including Leia and Admiral Ackbar are blown up and sucked into space. Leia uses the force to Mary Poppins herself back into the ship. Because apparently she can do that now. Ackbar sadly does not survive, which pisses me off because...  With Leia recovering and all the other leaders dead, Purple Haired Bitch becomes the new admiral. She and Poe bicker throughout the film and eventually he leads a mutiny against her. Then Leia gets out of bed and stops him by shooting him with a stun blaster. Admiral Purple Haired Bitch was right, you see, and toxically masculine Poe was wrong. He should have spent less time mansplaining and more time just obeying the superior women!  Admiral Purple Haired Bitch get's the most heroic moment in the movie where she sacrifices herself by hyperdrive-ramming into the main star destroyer. It was a cool moment, but why couldn't Admiral Fucking Ackbar have done that???? Would have been the perfect end for such an iconic character and would have had so much more impact on the viewer. But I guess with him being male and Mon Calimari apparently not being black enough, he couldn't be a hero in this leftist circle jerk.  So between the whole thing being Luke's fault, the villains all being white males and Poe causing more problems and Mary Sue Rey, homely dork Rose, General Leia and Admiral Gender Studies Professor all being the faultless heroes, it's pretty clear what this movie's message is. White men are evil and girl power!  Snoke's character was wasted. There was so much speculation about who he was and that was never answered. The most popular theory was that he was Darth Plagueis - referenced in one of the best scenes in the prequel trilogy, which I really hoped would be true because as far as I'm concerned him being the real big bad would have been pretty much the only thing that could justify the existence of the sequels (that or an outside threat from another galaxy). Alas, the sequels really have no reason to exist and are just murdering the original trilogy and the happy ending of Return of the Jedi for no reason.  And with Han, Luke and Ackbar dead and presumably Leia will be killed offscreen before the next movie, Disney have now not only symbolically killed Star Wars, they've literally killed Star Wars.  Rant Over."

I want to propose the following Act to help our fellow American citizens unhappy with the direction Trump is taking this country. The purpose of this Act is to help find and relocate these people into a country that better matches their world view.  The Generous Transfer For Oppressed Act (GTFO Act) would:  Allow funding for agency to help identify country that matches US citizens political views.  Work with the legal authorities in that country to secure legal residency for the person.  Give $100k per person to help get that person settled in their new home.  Provide First Class one way ticket to that country.  These services would be in exchange for:  Person giving up US citizenship and all rights and responsibilities thereof.  Person will never be allowed to enter the US ever again.  I think this would help many people who are currently oppressed by US capitalism and allow them to move to a low cost socialist utopia.  Thought? Suggestions?

"As we all are aware, and many members have posted, it is rare that a new President holds onto seats in their first midterm. We must combat this. We must do very detailed research on candidates running for the primary. We MUST get out and vote. However it is not just us, it is essential that we advocate for those running in the midterm, we MUST demonstrate how essential it is for fellow R's to get out and vote. We need to have the highest turnout rates we have ever seen. It is on all of us to continue to support this president, get the dems out of congress, and allow the GEOTUS to continue with his work. 25 Dem seats in the Senate are up next year. Only 10 are in deeply safe Blue states. 10 Republican seats in the Senate are up and they are saying only 1 is held in a deeply safe Red state. It is incredibly important that we do anything and everything (that is lawful, I mean, we aren't democrats...) to flip seats to red, secure the current red seats, and continue to MAGA. I beg of you all, do not take the midterms lightly, and do not let republican colleagues, friends, or family members, take this lightly. The Dems will be out in full force. Let's crush them. "

In 2012, during the fiscal cliff, the tax cuts were made permanent for single people earning less than $400,000 per year and couples making less than $450,000 per year, and eliminated for everyone else, under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012  Did you catch that last part where they were made permanent?  &gt; the tax cuts were made permanent for single people earning less than $400,000 per year and couples making less than $450,000 per year, and eliminated for everyone else, under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012  If the tax cuts work they will be extended, just as with the Bush cuts.

"http://i.magaimg.net/img/209r.jpg  Is one predisposed to be being a reprobate by DNA? Interesting enough, the man we all know as ""Bill Clinton"" the 42nd President of the United States, was born William Jefferson Blythe III.  (Side note, wonder If he needs to renounce his racist Confederate middle name? /s)  But that’s not the moral of our story….  Bill’s father, William Blythe Jr. has an extremely degenerate yet short history with the women of his day.  Blythe Jr, Bill's father, managed to wed 4 women (2 sisters), conceived 2 out of wedlock children by 2 separate women and committed bigotry all before having died at 28 years of age.  Bill was the only child conceived in wedlock of which was one of the women that his father had committed bigotry with.  Any one of those facts would be a serious scandal for fly over country during that period.  Blythe Jr died 3 months prior to Bill’s birth and Bill took his step father’s name at age 16.   From Wikipedia:  Blythe married four times. He married for the first time in December 1935 to Virginia Adele Gash; they were divorced only thirteen months later. Although no child was born to the couple during their marriage, they later had a son together. After the divorce, Virginia moved to California and married first a man named Coffelt, then a man named Charles Ritzenthaler. However, she and Blythe remained friends, and she visited him on occasion. A son was conceived during these visits, and Henry Leon Blythe was born in Sherman, Texas on June 17, 1938, some eighteen months after his parents had been divorced. Henry's parents lost touch with each other when he was an infant, after his father briefly married and divorced his mother's sister, and he (Henry) never knew his biological father or paternal siblings. Later in life, Henry Leon Blythe took the name Henry Leon Ritzenthaler in honor of a step-father. He ran several small businesses in Paradise, California, including a janitorial business, and died in 2009. He was unaware of his connection to the future president until the presidential campaign of 1992, when an investigation by The Washington Post, based on birth registry records, revealed details of Bill (William Jefferson Blythe III) Clinton's family. Ritzenthaler met his half-brother for the first time around that time, and the physical resemblance between them was remarked upon.[3] Blythe next married Minnie Faye Gash, his first wife's sister, in December 1940. The marriage was annulled only four months later, in April 1941, and there were no children. Shortly after the annulment, on May 3, 1941, Blythe married again. His third wife was Wanetta Ellen Alexander of Kansas City, Missouri, and the wedding was held in Jackson County, Missouri. Wanetta gave birth to Blythe's daughter on May 11, 1941, eight days after their wedding. She had become pregnant with Blythe's child prior to his short-lived second marriage to Minnie. Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn is the daughter of Wanetta and Blythe, and is still alive in 2016. Blythe and Wanetta were formally divorced three years later, in April 1944. They lost touch immediately afterwards; Wanetta, who eventually settled in Tucson, Arizona, had no inkling of Blythe's subsequent history until the presidential campaign of 1992 and the Washington Post story. Upon seeing old photographs of Bill Clinton's father flashed on TV, Wanetta ""swears on a stack of Bibles ... that that was the man she was married to"", said her son-in-law Bob Pettijohn, husband of her daughter Sharon.[citation needed] Blythe's divorce from Wanetta Alexander was granted in court on April 13, 1944. Seven months before that, on September 4, 1943, Blythe had bigamously ""married"" Virginia Dell Cassidy of Bodcaw, Arkansas. Blythe and Cassidy remained married until his death in a car crash on May 17, 1946. Three months after Blythe's death, on August 19, 1946, Cassidy gave birth to their only child, William Jefferson Blythe III, who as a teen took his stepfather's surname and became known as Bill Clinton, the future 42nd President of the United States. Cassidy had no knowledge of Blythe's previous marriages until decades later when The Washington Post ran an extensive story in 1993, based on birth and marriage registry records, to mark Father's Day.[4][5]  Spez: Post needed a pic.

She thinks highly of Hillary and praises all of her accomplishments while saying it just don't make sense to her that Hillary should take up knitting and be apart in making more of those beautiful pink pussy hats.

Politifact literally confirms the associated expenses exceed $5 billion and the service issues existed (even this year we went to insurer websites for my older family members to get insurance and it didn't work, we needed tu call in and wait an extra day) yet blatantly labels it false. They could just a easily labeled it true and explained why it's within reason to promote these figures. Bias duly noted again"

"...is talking about how much trouble the Republicans are in for the midterms.   **Are these people fucking kidding me?**  I'm not saying that Republicans and Trump should take the midterms lightly but they're making it sound like the tax plan was a big loss for the party.

Hello cucks !  You’re probably clicking on me from seeing me post elsewhere and I’m banned from LiberalCuckHumor so I can’t post this comment in the ignorant post that’s on the front page right now.   But let me give you a reminder about “Climate change “  The problem is the scam was originally called “global warming”. That’s WHY we are saying the joke about it being cold right now.  The North Pole was supposed to be melted by now. When that bullshit was called out the name of the scam was changed to “climate change”.    There are only 2 genders.

All of those corporations who expatriated to exploit cheaper tax rates in other countries who will go into full panic mode when they realize they're going to be paying tariffs on products they export to the US sooner rather than later. 
Cameras need to pan out when Trump arrives at airports to show how much support he actually has.  MAGA!
"#Thank God You Don't Live In Baltimore (If you do, I'm sorry, and I genuinely hope you escape soon)  Baltimore and some other towns like Detroit and Chicago have horrible, but well-earned, reputations as criminal hot-spots with shootings and robbings going on everywhere and all the time. Such a reputation is earned by being far outside the norm, but how far outside the norm they are is hard to quantify. Here's a new tool for your toolbox for putting the local home-town leftists in their place in regards to crime and guns.   Murder rate is typically measured by murders per 100,000 residents. Baltimore's 2016 rate was 51.1 per 100K.  Now take 51.1 and *multiply it by how many hundreds of thousands of people live in your home town or county, and you'll have the number of murders your locality would need in order to match* Baltimore's murder rate. For comparison, let's go with Plano, Texas, with a population of 284,000 (or so).  51.1 X 2.84 = 145. Their actual number of murders is [typically 5 or less.](http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Plano-Texas.html)  ***But why is this important?***  If the problem was the guns themselves, *the murder rate would be far more uniform across the nation,* as everyone across the nation has access to guns to one degree or another. By showing that the murder problem doesn't exist on the same scale in one place as another, it shows that guns are not the problem in murders, it's the murderous people. This is backed up by further research that [54% of U.S. counties did not have a murder](https://crimeresearch.org/2017/04/number-murders-county-54-us-counties-2014-zero-murders-69-1-murder/) at all in 2014, while 2% had 51% of the murders.  ***Comparisons, just for fun***  [Here is a list of the country's top ten most dangerous cities.](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-dangerous-cities-in-the-united-states.html)  Let's take Baltimore's murder rate and extrapolate the number of murders the U.S. would need in order to match it.  The United States: Pop. [323 mil](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=NURIWpHdCurqjwTkg5fwAQ&amp;q=united+states+of+america&amp;oq=united+states+of+america&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l2j0i20i264k1j0l7.1180.4403.0.4528.25.17.0.2.2.0.449.2300.0j10j2j0j1.13.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..10.15.2319.0..35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i131i20i264k1.0.-Qm5D-aAwAc), 3,230 X 51.1 = 165,053 murders per year to match Baltimore's murder rate. For the record, in 2015, [there were only 15,696.](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/latest-crime-statistics-released)  What's the population of your hometown or county? What would the number of murders have to be to match Baltimore's rate?

"How the hell are they going to lie to their constituents about this?  They themselves said the tax changes were terrible, and now they are saying that tax breaks are great but Republicans are bad because they didn't make the breaks permanent? "
"It would be the official community and Trump's own platform to reach out to Americans and the world abroad. Why should GEOTUS have to solely rely on companies who despise him, who block our allies, and work directly with the establishment? The cabinet should still post on facebook/twitter/IG but branch out, and create something entirely new and directly to the people. ������������"
"""Politics is just like show business. You have a hell of an opening, coast for a while, and have a hell of an end."""
"Zechariah 12:   ""The oracle of the word of the Lord concerning Israel: Thus declares the Lord, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the spirit of man within him: 2 “Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering to all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem will also be against Judah. 3 On that day **I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will surely hurt themselves.** And all the nations of the earth will gather against it. ""  The nations of the earth will gather against it. Isn't that exactly what happened with the UN vote? 129-9 IIRC  Genesis 12 1-3  Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. **I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse**, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”   My interpretation of this verse is that anyone who blesses Israel will be blessed by God in return, and anyone who ""dishonors"" the blesser will be cursed by God.  So Trump does something nice for Gods chosen people, to bless America, which is a decision hated by the world, as predicted by the bible.  Maybe Trump really is a time traveler? What are your thoughts, pedes? "
Just saw the joke on the front page. Gotta love how they have no respect for a president who has done so much.
"I was at Barnes &amp; Noble yesterday and found this book ""The Big Lie"" I've been hearing about. A lot of Trumpsters I know seem to be familiar with this book. I briefly flipped through some of the pages and liked what I saw (didn't feel like spending $30+ though). Who else here has actually read the book? What do y'all think of it, and do you recommend it?"
Empty seats on TV would definitely send a message. 
"**New York Times, who was hard on pushing the [""Site packages""](https://archive.is/2wQ59#selection-2335.159-2335.165) narrative during the Net neutrality debate, apparently [blocks it's own site demanding Packages.](https://i.imgur.com/BfMzMDQ.png?2)**  NYT has lied a number of times about how Net Neutrality has, and will affect us in the upcoming months, from Lying about how the [Internet always ran on equal grounds](http://archive.is/YbA5e#selection-2903.176-2903.181)  &gt;The internet has spurred innovation precisely because it has been an open, level playing field, where barriers to offering new products and services have continually come down over time. or in fallaciously conflating colleges, blocking certain internet services for any number of reasons to the actions of the internet service providers, in the same article.  &gt;Some colleges didn’t like Facebook, and because they functioned as their students’ internet providers, they would simply block the site.  Back in 2015, Richard Bennett, a co-inventor of wi-fi stated, in an article criticizing the implementation of Net Neutrality Laws  *""It’s a certainty that the rules imposed on Wheeler will slow the Internet’s rate of progress and lock in current applications.""* In this article he confidently links us to an article written by IEEE Spectrum, as he states, *""a publication of the largest professional organization of computer engineers""* about how ""unlevel"" [the playing field has always been.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/net-neutralitys-technical-troubles)   &gt;A key argument for this approach is the 2003 observation by Tim Wu, now a Columbia University law professor, that packet switching inherently discriminates against time-sensitive applications. That is, packet switching without Net management can’t prevent degradation of time-sensitive services on a busy network.  Chief protocol architect of the pre-commercial Internet, David Clarke, has also has similar assertions about the inherent inequity (and therefore inequality) [of the internet] (http://www.netcompetition.org/net-neutrality/happy-little-bunny-rabbit-dreams-is-what-internets-architect-calls-net-neutrality-assumptions) By refering to them as *""Happy little bunny-rabbit dreams""*  It's nothing new for News websites to offer packages to read new entries, [Wall Street Journal does it as well,](https://store.wsj.com/v2/shop/wsjusblackfriday17?trackingCode=aaqqkavu&amp;cid=WSJ_SCH_GOO_ACQ_NA&amp;n2IKsaD9=n2IKsaD9&amp;Pg9aWOPT=Pg9aWOPT&amp;Cp5dKJWb=Cp5dKJWb&amp;APCc9OU1=APCc9OU1&amp;ef_id=WJZANQAAAFXIJcd4:20171225022918:s) however it does shine light on who the real corporations are who want to gobble the money of the consumers may actually be, and we can take even the most pleasant of an ironic vindication, that companies that pushed the hardest against [Restoring Internet Freedoms](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-347927A1.pdf) can be far more [censorious](https://thedailycoin.org/2017/12/24/efforts-combat-fake-news-arent-working-facebook-admits-video/) than one may believe   *A Man Named Rj - Reporter for T_D News*"

"Twas the night before Christmas;  And all through Deb's house,  Anxiety was stirring,  Fear of the jailhouse.  Nightmares hung in her head did scare,  Still hoping the law would not come there.  The Trumps were nestled all snug in their beds,  While visions of Deb's shackles danced in our heads.  And PO-TUS with shitposts and I with my bantz,  Had just settled in to see Reddit's champs.  When outside the White House there arose such a SKREEEEE,  The sound of those Dems who the law went to see.  I sprang from my bed all proud like a steed.  And to my computer I flew like a flash,  Turned on my monitor and resumed the e-clash.  The salt on the breast of the new fallen Trump tweet,  Gave joy to the assembled online centipedes.  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,  The President, my dad, face affixed in a sneer.  With a grin and a giggle I heard a faint click,  I knew in a moment Democrats would be sick.  More rapid than eagles, the shitposts he made,  And he laughed, and he typed, and he threw yet more shade,  Now! Maxine, now! Nancy, now! Chuckie and Merkley!  On! Franken, on! Warren, on! Sanders and Leahy!  ON DEFENSE YOU GO NOW! BACKPEDAL NOW YOU ALL!  NOW CYA, CYA, CYA ALL!  As dry jailhouse air fills Debbie's lungs,  With a tear in her eye, a sad song she'd just sung,  In an orange jumpsuit and cell locked she truly knew,  That Clinton and Soros would suicide her too.  And Then in an instant, a conclusion I drew,  That globalism, that evil, my dad just slew.  As I laid down in blankets, that false song now dead,  My dad Donald burst back in to show me a thread,  Dressed in silk pajamas, from his head to his foot,  He said he would tweet ""Russia is like the bigfoot!""  A big folder of shitposts were saved in his phone.  His craft over the decades had been sharply honed.  His eyes - how they twinkled! his dimples how merry,  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,  The light from the device was making his face glow.  His thumbs, they were flying he was on a great spree,  Rubbing in the fact that he had locked up Debbie.  He had a broad face, and a little round belly  That shook when he laugh’d, like a bowl full of jelly:  He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,  And I laugh’d when I saw him in spite of myself;  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,  Soon told me the country had nothing to dread.  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  And from all of the Democrats, tears he would jerk.  With his thumbs up I knew he was saying goodnight,  He turned, and closed the door, and he flew out of sight.  He danced through the White House with his phone to his ear,  Asking Kellyanne if she'd seen his latest verbal spear.  But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight-  HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!"
"The weapon used to kill Kate Steinle was a Sig Sauer.  The shooter claims he found the weapon, picked it up, and it ""went off"".  I wonder if his attorneys used the lack of a safety to convince a low-information jury that the gun was at fault for being ""unsafe."""
"I thought there was supposed to be a vote at 11, but I don't see any threads about it. "
"  I'm from Canada and I'm pretty pumped  for the Last Jedi  and when it gets closer to the movie of course the Star Wars related ads start playing. And as I'm watching them I'm noticing that none of the ads are not in anyway geared towards men at all. I understand that all the new movies have Strong Female Leads which I'm fine with but it seems like they are trying to cut men and boys out if the picture. I'm not talking about adult and teenage men but young boys (4-11). They might see all the ads and say why would I want to see star wars it's for girls right?  What happened to the ads where the brothers are pretending to be rebels and storm troopers and play fighting. What happened to that idea of men and women being equals (socially, politically, economically). I just think that here in Canada and maybe the US SJW advertisers are going overkill on the women can watch star wars thing. I know they can watch star wars and they should they are great films.   Ps: I placed this in the star wars reddit currently getting ignored    Ad Links:  https://youtu.be/ocB0CVVhEnQ  (French but you can still get the point)   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_QdVurPKvak  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OgQxjcB-nlU "

Stefan Molyneux and Cernovich are saying 'bigger than Conyers' and will be released by one of the big MSM outlets like NYT/WaPo.
"Net Neutrality promises equality for everyone over the internet. Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Net Neutrality forces Internet Service Providers (ISP) to give the same priority for everyone who uses them. This sounds great but unfortunately, not all companies purchase their access to the internet via an ISP.  As an Information Technology major I will try to explain how large companies avoid using ISP's for their internet. [ISP Tier Chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg/550px-Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg.png)  This is how we connect to the internet. We purchase our data plan from a tier 3 network (your local ISP). This network connects throughout the internet by travelling through Tier 2 and Tier 1 ISP's depending on where the connection is traveling to. With Net Neutrality everyone would be given the same priority on this chart so no matter how poor an individual or a small business is, they can still compete in the market. Major companies do NOT use ISP's!  Look at the tier chart, the yellow ""IXP"" cloud resembles an internet exchange point. This is the point where ISP's often connect to in order to send data elsewhere. Large companies invest millions in creating their own data centers and connect directly to these peering exchange points. So what does this mean?  Large companies are completely **unaffected** by Net Neutrality. Here is google admitting how they utilize the internet exchange points: https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure  So if Net Neutrality doesn't effect Google, why do they push for it?  No startup company could possibly afford their own data center. They have to purchase a data plan from an ISP. This means that it is impossible for a small company to compete with Google in terms of internet speeds. This advantage, in an extreme scale, could lead to monopolization.  Conclusion: Large companies that push for Net Neutrality including: Google, Amazon, Netflix, Porn sites, and reddit, are doing so to take better control of their markets. This hurts competition significantly and needs to be fixed now.  If there was a way to force Net Neutrality on ALL companies it could possibly work but I don't see how it could be well enforced on these large companies. Regardless, whether Net Neutrality is good or not can be debated, however, as it stands now is undoubtedly bad for our economy.  Ask any questions!"
"I know it's San Fransisco and all, but who hired this piece of shit as a defense attorney? Maybe the motivation all along was to spite Trump for talking about the wall, Kate, and illegals"
"All you have to do is put the pieces together. Thanks for the link from other posts.   1.) ABC News had to make a correction. They originally reported candidate Trump instead of President-Elect Trump. [Link here](https://twitter.com/ABC/status/936805557029048321)  2.) White House claims they got cleared to contact Russia by the Obama State Department. [Link here](http://archive.is/3CFzU)  3.) James Clapper denies that happened. [Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsLBlzBo1vo)  4.) Here is a link to the Washington Examiner from Jan 13th, 2017 saying they did get cleared. [Link here](http://archive.is/ZDmU4)  5.) Here is a link to a video of them saying so at a press briefing. [Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vO3GNexHYI&amp;t=28m25s)  6.) Here is a link to info about Michael McFaul during Obama running in 2008 talking with the Russians. [Link here](http://archive.fo/Gpvhf)"
He's a fucking liar! He promised we'll get tired of winning. We're not!
"Can I just say, all you based freedom loving shitlord deplorables are some of the greatest patriots I know.  Everyday, you bring high energy, spicy dank memes, and best of all The Truth.     If you all lived close to me, I would invite you over for a taquiza.. (carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, and adodaba) drinks of all kinds, and an opportunity to shake your hand.    Some call us basement dwellers, some call us racist bigots, nazis, and alt right... But I see great American men and women of all colors and creeds and sexual orientations, who refuse to accept the false song of globalism.  I see patriots willing to stand for what is right, for what it is Truth! I see patriots who will fight the good fight to Make America Great Again.   Merry Christmas to all of you amazing people in this DOM_Reddit.  Even though I’ve never met you, this post is for you! 2 scoops, 2 Genders, 2 Terms, MAGA! "

"...... ""initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.""  OMG Reeeee muh Russia....Reeeeeeee"
"Interviewer, on tax bill: ""So is Donald Trump going to get involved, or is he going to sit back?""    Kellyanne Conway: ""Donald Trump does not sit back."""
"And all these amendments represent various special interests and sacred cows, legislation and issues that could be managed some other time, but wait until now, so they can pressure each other with the threat of not voting (even though they will) as they promised. ""We the People"" are not being well served with grandstanding and melodrama. If they did their jobs, this wouldn't be happening. The vote would have been yesterday. "

"As the MSM drops the Russia narrative and moves on to the ""Trump Harassment"" stage, don't forget how Obama and the entire Elite sneered at Romney for suggesting that Russia was a threat to the US.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1409sXBleg  After the 2016 election they  immediately attempted to turn things around and claim that Russia is an existential threat that Trump is ignorning.   Turns out Obama and the MSM are the real enemies.  "
"It will either work, or it won't.  If it works, dems risk alienating even the liberal minded who care about their cash.  That's why they tried so hard to poison the public beforehand with their ""assessments"" of the bill.  When people see a net gain, its like a ""Vote For Trump"" advertisement on each paycheck and tax return.  Now, they are left with trying to convince the people who don't pay taxes that it is negatively effecting those that do.  Sad."

"Coworker of mine asked me this morning about a question she has in her Masters Program.     ""How will you challenge the myth of the American Dream and Meritocracy?"".      This came without any clarifying argument. So I pulled up the definition.       ""Meritocracy is a political philosophy stating that power should be vested in individuals almost exclusively based on ability and talent. Advancement in such a system is based on performance measured through examination and/or demonstrated achievement in the field where it is implemented."".

"Palestinian Authority was only established in 1994. Palestine was never a country. There are no Palestinians. There are displaced Jordanians who were made homeless by the war of 1967 with Israel. But there were never palestinians. SJW's Hate jews. They love Palestinians who are as real as Dilberts Elbonians. They never existed. Their only purpose is to destroy Israel. Don't fall for the bullshit and bone up on your world history. Palestine has never been a real place.   Never had a real people, and the only purpose is simply the will of powerful arab neighbors to eradicate jewish history in the region and claim it all as their own.  The fight is about Temple Mount. In Jerusalem. A place of Holy Jewish sites. Sites that have been there for over 3000 years. Islam claims this place as the spot the pedophile mohammed acsended to heaven in 632 AD some thousand years after jews had already been there.

"Since Comey's initial testimony, and firing, and changing his story, he has repurposed that phrase... ""big deal"" in his later claims that he did feel pressure from President Trump over his ""hope"" that, considering the non-serious nature of Flynn's process crimes, that they'll be able to let that go.    Now, only seven months down the road, anyone searching for ""Comey big deal"" is filled with pages of results from outlets only referencing Comey's change of tune from...  &gt;“I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience,” Comey said in testimony on May 3.    There is always the question about President Trump's reasoning for not firing Comey immediately. It seems keeping him on for the first few months allowed Comey just enough rope to hang his credibility with.

"....3.  Love Actually.    If you’ve never seen this movie it has a star studded ensemble cast that follows the lives of several different people dealing with love and the Christmas season.    While I am usually not a sappy person for some reason this movie has several scenes which make me look around for the onions.  However,  while watching it this year there was a different sadness that hung over the movie.  It is clear in the movie just how much the U.K. loves Christmas and what a great and unique culture the U.K. has.  Or at least did have.  Now just a mere 15 years after this movie was made I wondered how much of it was true anymore after being overrun by secularism and foreign invaders.  It was sad to think of such a great culture being flushed down the toilet in the name of globalism."
"Consider it, the definition of brainwash reads “make (someone) adopt radically different beliefs by using systematic and often forcible pressure.”  What is the MSM if not forced, systematic pressure on casual audiences (especially extremely impressionable millennials, which is who I’m referring to in the title of this post) to adopt the radical beliefs they deem conducive to the leftist/globalist agenda?  Exposure to this brainwashing has created a knee-jerk reaction in so many people to hate President Trump, defend Islam, support the most corrupt politicians in American history...the list goes on as we all know.   It’s sad because if these people are ever going to break free of this spell of bull shit the MSM has meticulously cast upon the world for generations (especially alongside the proliferation of screens, i.e. readily available fake news at your fingertips), it would require a great amount of mental fortitude, but such strength of mind and character is among those foundational aspects of society that is systematically and forcibly getting marginalized to the point of utter obscurity.

"Roy Moore loosing isn't that bad on its own, I was kinda expecting it. But seriously, we haven't had a win for a while.

Rand Paul, The Zodiac Killer, the Sleepy Doctor, and a local rep in Michigan, Jim Runstead. I hope there's more, but I don't see any. Whether or not the Republicans win or lose the midterms doesn't matter. We, the Trump Republicans, the Nationalists, have to win the midterms, or the movement is dead. For God's sake, the uniparty already had the balls to bring articles of impeachment to the floor. They lost, of course, but Trump has not been convicted or even arrested for any crime and yet they are already firing up the impeachment machinery.   So, please, give me some good news."
"I never get to talk about President Trump because my friends are all liberals, but I needed to tell SOMEONE how I feel about him and I figured this is the one place I won't get shouted down  Words cannot accurately describe how much I love this president. I'm in my early 20's so the only other leader I've experienced is Obama (I was in middle school with Bush and just repeated whatever my parents said.) Watching Obama apologize for being American, among many other things, made me ashamed of who my leader was.  But our new president has changed that. President Trump is a man who ran for the office, not because it was the next step in his career, but because he truly wanted to help the country we love! Everything he's enacted has worked, and our country is respected again. He is a patriot in every sense of the word, and I am so proud to say he is my president, and I'm so proud to have voted for him.  "

Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:  **FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**  &gt;Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651  **Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**  &gt;Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508  **b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**  &gt;The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503  **Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**  &gt;Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518  **UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **  &gt;If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.  **Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**  &gt;We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...""  **And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**  &gt;176.We also reject AT&amp;T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&amp;T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],”648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.  #TL;DR  *    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.  *    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government ""extravagant statutory power over the national economy"".   *    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.  *    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).  *    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.  *    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.  *    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.  *    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.  *    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  **Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? Allegedly this FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.  Trump's admin is trying to fight for your privacy.**"

I understand there is always spin but usually it comes with some kind of cherry picked statistic that is partially true but partially omitted from the argument. I saw this post on reddit all: https://imgur.com/T7FZRIZ  I went into the thread just to see what people were saying and it's just blanket statements about how every single person loses all these deductions without mentioning the doubling of the standard deduction. The highest tax bracket does not even change, how does that help rich people? If you're rich in CA and NY you're mega fucked by this bill with the property tax and state income tax not being deducted.   What are they using as the main talking point statistics to the blanket statement that this is going to rape middle class people and save the rich millions? I am just curious. "

"Hillary Clinton has talked with Russians. Barrack Obama has talked with Russians. Anyone who does international business has talked with Russians. I'd be shocked if every US presidential campaign post cold war had not talked with Russians.   According to a fake news site, Flynn is prepared to testify against Trump for directing him to ""make contact with Russians"". If this turns out to be true, it would be completely legal. It would also be completely legal if the Russians told team Trump that they hoped they won. It would even be completely legal if the Russians gave team Trump some sort of information (after all, team Hillary isn't in jail for the Dossier). It would only become illegal if team Trump agreed to do something in exchange for the Russians giving them assistance in the election.   And apparently, since the Clintons aren't in jail for compromising American uranium reserves in exchange for $500K in Russian cash, the ""tit for tat"" bar is even higher than we mere citizens can comprehend.   I'm beyond tired of the news blowing up every time a member of Trump's team, or someone related to his team, or someone who does the dry cleaning for someone related to his team, is discovered to have had a conversation with someone who is Russian. It's absolutely absurd. Judicial Watch is completely right-- Mueller is WAY out of control. "

Why haven't any charges been filed yet? What are the people in charge waiting for? The only way I can reconcile this in my brain is to think that investigations have not been completed and the hammer will fall once all the evidence is gathered &amp; ironclad cases can be made.  I firmly believe that the Clintons and people in the justice department, fbi, dnc, etc. have colluded, committed crimes against the USA and have been lying to the American people for a very long time.

The ""Obama's economic legacy"" claim is now 100% debunked, not in theory or speculation-but in real world observation, and any attempt to stall or block Trump's economic agenda can be called out factually, not speculatively, as anti-American, communist globalism, and spiteful toward the American poor and working class.

But it doesn’t stop there Pedes, under the new senate tax bill my business will ALSO keep huge portions of the yearly earnings, to then, in turn, be used to grow it larger. This is what those Dems don’t want people to see, real Americans benefitting in a real, tangible way from the God Emperor himself!  Spez: “you're a greedy faggot who only cares about himself. You should do the world a favor and kill yourself. You aren't getting 40,000 a year and everyone knows you are a fucking liar.

"Hello pedes. Never posted here before, but I'm looking for some help. At my university, I'm taking a public speaking class and as the semester is coming to an end, we're tasked with writing and delivering a persuasive speech. I chose the topic of why gun laws should not be increased.   I believe that the legal ownership of guns in America is a great thing. It's protected by our second amendment, and (from what I understand) they do not statistically contribute to higher rates of gun related crimes.   The problem, however, is that I need print sources. I'm finding it hard to find any print sources that are pro gun. Now I'm not talking specifically from a newspaper or anything; As long as it's from a source that also prints publications. I was hoping any of you might have some goodies hidden in your arsenals that I could potentially reference in my speech. I chose to come here, because well, to be honest, this is probably the only place I visit on Reddit where I don't feel totally ostracized.  ----------- But I also feel I am quite uneducated on this topic. I am not really sure how to search, because I am not sure of what to search other than ""Why gun laws don't work""."

Liberals are completely delusional and brainwashed and will only believe what the media tells them. The only way to impeach the POTUS is if they committed HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS impeaching the POTUS just because they disagree with you is just childish and Good Luck impeaching Trump."

"              **please read thru!!**  When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the *separation*. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their **Creator** with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the *Right of the People* to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for **light and transient causes**; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.—  But when a long train of *abuses and usurpations*, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their **duty**, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.The history of the present United States Government is a history of repeated injuries and **usurpations**, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Body, whose character in whole persons is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these States, solemnly publish and declare, That these united states are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the established governance, and that all political connection between them and the established governance , is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. **Donald** TRUMP is our fulfillment of our promise, OUR DESTINY to bring about a more perfect union, to save our world!! **it is up to us to provide new guards for OUR FUTURE**"

You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die""  ""Oh shut up, silly woman,"" said the reptile with a grin  ""You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in  ""Take me in, oh tender woman  Take me in, for heaven's sake  Take me in oh tender woman, "" sighed the snake"

"Back in the primary I voted for Cruz, not because I was the biggest fan, but because in my mind he was the most sane choice that had a chance of winning. Sleepy Doctor Ben Carson was my guy.   To my shock Trump won the primary. I wasn't a Never-Trumper, but I definitely was of the opinion that he could never beat Hillary. He said some spicy things on the campaign trail, got a few good laughs. I was only vaguely aware of the great meme war, but I didn't know about the yuge groundswell of support he had on the interwebs and all across the country. I always thought polls were tilted democrat, but I hadn't considered the shy Trump supporters.  Come election day, I threw in my vote for Trump thinking my purple state would never go for Trump, but I couldn't stand by and let Hillary get in. To my shock once again he ended up winning, and winning bigly too. I was full of mixed feelings about his presidency though, it wasn't until months later I started to see this guy was the real deal. More real than we've had in America in the past 30 years. Real enough that he already has my 2020 vote hands down.  I heard rumors of T_D, how it was full of Nazis etc. but I was familiar with 4chan and pol and knew that claim was way overblown, and the Nazi shit was there mostly to be as off putting as possible. Lurked on T_D for awhile because I liked the interface a lot more, and saw there's no Nazi shit at all. The few times it shows up people jump into the thread to shitstomp it down because we ain't about that racism shit. Then started commenting, then started posting every once and again when I had something worth saying. This is my go to place for news that otherwize goes unnoticed by the MSM, and it has given me what normies in my life see as an uncanny sixth sense about what's going on in the world. But really, it's the combined power of T_D and pol autists. But its a good feeling.  And the rest is history. Glad to be on board the Trump train. "
"All over twitter you have white liberals saying ""white people, we need to do better"" and stuff like that.  The funny thing is that these people are the true racists. They view blacks as people who need their help and acknowledgment. Meanwhile, some of my closest friends are black and I judge people individually.  I just always found this kind of thing to be hilarious because people like this stick out like a sore thumb and you can tell they don't know many black people. They're also probably the types of people who lock their doors when they see a black man, but then turn around and tweet about how wonderful they are.   Rant over. God bless from PA pedes."
The left says anyone who supports Trump is a Nazi and that trump himself is Hitler yet they're the ones who don't think that the Jews have a right to a homeland. Imagine trying to tell a lefty that Mecca belongs to anyone else.

"I find it ironic that they are bitching about the ""deficit"" it will supposedly cause (it most likely wont because new jobs will be brought back and people will be spending more), but when did they ever give a shit about the deficit when it came to the deficit or national debt? Look at what they did to the national debt with Obamacare. It absolutely skyrocketed due to Obamacare and Obama spending like a madman. Trump actually has a period where he is at a net gain and now the Democrats have to lie to try and make this look like a bad bill and like they care about the deficit and the national debt.

"[Luke 2:15-20 KJV] And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.   And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.   And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."

Oh but burning your neighborhoods down and acting like thugs is great and such a great display of “solidarity.” Well folks, at least now you and I know that the MSM would much rather stand up for, and positively report on Muslims than us regular pro-trump American citizens. The enemy of the people on full display."

"There is a war being waged right now in our great nation. It is not a war which is fought with bombs or rifles. But rather a war which is being waged in the shadows of Government, before our very eyes. Waged with propaganda, political trickery, and silent murder.   A man whom the American people elected to be their head of state is under attack by his OWN staff. His OWN agencies. We call these individuals the collective deep state. Many if not all of them are Obama era holdovers. Let me make myself very clear here folks. We are in the midst of an ongoing attempted coup! This is ILLEGAL. And UNCONSTITUTIONAL!   The deep state and corrupt evil politicians are not simply exclusive to the democrat party. The Republican party is also infected with this political virus. There are members of the Republican party who have a vested interest in covering up various political crimes they have committed against YOU. You the American people. This is why they attack ANYBODY whom poses them a threat. Because they are scared out of their minds of YOU. The American public.   Roy Moore is a man of principles. And he cannot be swayed, bought or sold. This is why there are multiple false accusations of sex crimes against him. Ask yourself this question, why wait 40 some years to report a crime? It makes no sense. Propaganda is a dangerous weapon. Ask anyone who survived the Nationalist Socialists in germany. Or the communists in Russia.....  Roy Moore is a threat to the corrupt political cancer that has infested our nation untested and unchecked for a century or more. Now is your chance to vote for a man who will directly be part of the solution. Now is your chance to finally demand justice from the corruption that has ravaged our liberties and our freedoms for so long.   They are not afraid of our president.   They are not afraid of senators or congresspersons.   They are afraid of the American public. Because they know that we don't take bullshit when it comes to our liberties, our freedoms, and our Constitution.   They are afraid of YOU.   Get out and make them answer to you for their corruption​ and treason by VOTING.   I don't have to tell you who is the right candidate to represent the people of Alabama and the people of this great nation."

"We learned the Trump Curse is real!  Once the dust settles and the cheater conspiracy theorists have their say, we need to be honest with ourselves.  1. Trump did not endorse Moore in the primary. 2. We never would have been in this spot had the Voters of Alabama acquiesced to Trumps endorsement of Strange.  3. Moore was a flawed National Candidate. Put aside the sex shit, he was going to be nothing but a fantastic fundraising source for Democrats. A loser that we are better off without.  4. The Voters of Alabama put Trump in a bad place. What choice did they give him, but to endorse Moore. Alabama put a loss around Trumps neck. Plain and simple. He can't call them out, but I am. Alabama, this is your fault!  The next time Trump endorses a candidate. Don't ask questions. Don't think you know better than him. Don't act like a bunch of morons. Just do what President Trump tells you to do.   Luther Strange should have one in a landslide tonight and he would have. It's just that the Voters of Alabama thought they knew better than Trump.  Yes, the Trump Curse is real!  "
"Every time something big is about to go down, today being the Alabama vote, Trump drops something he knows will trigger the liberal media, but that he can easily talk his way out of. They completely divert their attention away from what they have been actively fighting in order to cover his pre-planned drop. Today he tweets about Gillibrand, in a way he KNOWS they will jump all over it. Now he can cite his use of quotes and such to explain that he meant something very specific and not at all what they have accused him of. He does this time and time again. He so easily diverts their attention. How have they not caught on when it is SO obvious what he is doing!?"
And more motivated.
"We let the media win at smearing their way to discouraging our side and encouraging their side. They are using emotionally driven women. The psychology of most woman will not allow them to associate themselves with someone who was even accused. Yet alone hearing it almost as fact by the media. There has been no trial, no investigation, or no charges. The cuckservatives let us all down. We must educate them about the media and how they are protecting corrupt reps and Dems aka DEEP STATE. They will win with emotionally unstable women and their cuck husbands.  Literally running scared from unproven allegations from the most dirty, disgusting, shameful, people on earth. "

"This is quite simple.   Did I have something against him? I didn’t hate him as a person, no.  But I’m glad he lost. When the media put a spotlight like they did on this election, and made it seem infinitely more important than it was, a big part of me hoped Moore would lose.   Why?  2 reasons.   1). As said above, this election seemed infinitely more important than it was.   2). Moore losing under the spotlight in Alabama would be the wake-up call conservatives throughout the United States needed for 2018. They NEEDED to see if they didn’t turn out, they could lose. They needed to see nowhere was safe.   This election ensured that. It was vital this lesson was learned, and vital it was learned now. Because this election wasn’t that important, it could easily be afforded to be lost, and the media attention is exactly why it was needed to be lost.   Trump winning woke up many liberals.   Moore losing under the spotlight he did, woke up many conservatives.   Although I’m independent, I am anti-leftist; I was unhappy one won yesterday at face value, but so very glad he did overall, because his win is insignificant, but Moore’s loss is very significant.   Jones’ win was pyrrhic, and people are now awake. "

After seeing about 8 commercials for this hack movie in a 30 minute time span, I look it up and it's by STEVEN SPIELBERG! It stars Hanks, Streep, Odenkirk, and probably a bunch of other lesser known libtards. I noticed the commercials don't mention it's Spielberg. He's probably trying hard to avoid the Trump curse but I say we boycott this movie and hit them in the wallet.  I went to the great internet just to confirm that it wasn't a coincidence and it truly was Spielberg's anti-Trump movie and I got confirmation of what I expected.

But the whole interview is a good listen.  Sibley's Comments:  Attorney Sibley, ""I think there were deep political motives for this case going forward.""  Sibley believes the DC Madam escort service may have been used in intelligence gathering for national security in what he calls a ""honey pot"".  He can only speculate that this may be the reason that the Maryland prosecutors declined to pursue the case.  But he offers a reason that Washington DC prosecutors, with more political ties to Republicans in 2006, moved forward.  Sibley states, ""In October 2006 the Republicans were in a panic about losing the House and they may have been looking for dirt on Democratic candidates they could have embarrassed.""  Other major reveals:  - DC Madam's escorts were being used by a later destroyed Al Qaida suspect - After DC Madam's arrest, Attorney Sibley worked with now-disgraced ABC News Reporter BRIAN ROSS to identify clients - ABC News revealed only a few clients associated with Bush administration and GOP - One of the U.S. Attorneys in Washington, DC was a client - Arch Diocese of Washington DC called DC Madam Escort Service on more than one occasion - FISA judge took over DC Madam court case and quashed all of Sibley's subpeonas, unprecedented takover of case  "

"For way too long America has forgotten the national pride that comes with space exploration. It is so nice to have a president that isn't afraid to spend some money on space exploration. So many modern technologies are only possible because of necessities for space travel. One of my favorite quotes is from Randal Munroe who said ""The universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there's no good reason to go into space - each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision"". I'm sorry if this is a bit rambling, I just haven't been this excited in a long time, if you don't think this is a big deal you are wrong because Donald Trump may have just single handily ensured the survival of the human race for millennia to come (If Elon doesn't make it)."

"I have found a family in this sub, people who like me for who I am, who see past the exterior and the race and the extraneous crap we arm ourselves with every day.   I feel embarrassed posting this, but I really do need prayers.  I've been going through a rough patch these last few weeks and I don't even know why.  Nothing super terrible has happened, but I had some family drama over Christmas and just feel like I don't do anything right.  My mother was on drugs, my father is moving on with his new wife and doesn't seem to have much time anymore, my brother and sister completely forgot me at Christmas.   I have arthritis in my spine and hips from a bad accident, and it only seems to be getting worse, and I just kind of realized I'll never have a pain free life where I can truly make a difference for MAGA or anything else.  I just feel like I'm in a dark, dense fog and I can't find my way out.  And I feel weak that it took so little to break me.    Anyway, I'm sure this will get lost in the stream, but if anybody does see it, please send prayers, or vibes, or good thoughts.  God bless you and yours.    UPDATE:  I just want to thank everyone for the kind words, wishes, and prayers.  I finally got a good night's sleep and feel much healthier and happy and ready to carry on with MAGA.  Sometimes, it's easy to fall in the trap of feeling sorry for myself, but I'm going to pick myself up and look outward.

"I’m a rare find... a republican social worker. I spread my message slowly in enemy territory day in and out. One of my dear friends is someone whose political ideology I cannot stand. She is a snowflake. She cried the day trump won. Her life revolves around the “resistance”... all this being said, as a person she is sweet and lovely and a dear friend that I hope one day to red pill. It would be my greatest accomplishment.   I often play dumb around her when it comes to politics, letting her believe I’m uninformed and need guidance.  She will spout whatever rhetoric she hears on NPR or CNN, and then I innocently question it by playing devils advocate. Yesterday she was going on about the new tax plan and how it’s only benefitting the rich... �� so I said, really? Because I used one those tax calculators and it looks like I’m going to get more money under this plan, she had no response for about 5 seconds, then said something about how they are cutting all these programs in the tax plan and rambled on trying to make a coherent point and failing. It’s little victories like this that get me through my day in a building full of snowflakes ������"
Merry Christmas everyone! May God bless you all and let's continue Making America Great Again.

"Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate  of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her irate  and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand.  She started yelling and swearing at me and  I slammed the door on her. I’m so distressed right now  I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to treat the sow  of my mom like that but I’m literally in shock from the results tonight.  I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing, aight?  This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown.  I don’t want to believe the world is so corrupt. I feel like a clown  I want a future to believe in. I want Bernie to be president  and fix this broken country but I feel like just a resident.  I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn’t supposed to be like this,  I thought he was polling well in New York???? I get so fucked on Grindr jizz. "

"This is what I think happened. Roy Moore is a strong and good christian. However, there were several things that were wrong. He did try to resist the government from taking down the 10 commandments. I think it could of stayed up, but the government said it must come down, and he resisted. He resisted the same on Same Sex marriage in the state too, not making probate judges issue same sex marriage licenses.   Also, the amount of hard line views he is not as popular as it once was in Alabama, although it still is a strong conservative state. Don't worry, this was an exception, Alabama is not going to become a blue state, don't worry. This was an exception. Either way, the rape scandal was pretty much false, but it hurt him so badly, the interview with Sean hannity didn't help, even if the accusations are almost 100% false.  Also, he did a few things that weren't so good. His wife said they weren't antisemitic, because one of their lawyers was a Jew. Really, why didn't you say Jewish, it just looks bad. A few other things seemed kind of incompetent. Also, he refused to concede seems petty, since their is no easily available evidence of voter fraud(There still may have been though), it looks real petty. He kind of looks like Hillary not making her concession speech until the day after, but only worse because he didn't even call the Jones campaign to say congrats.I don't think a recount will change anything, and we don't want to look like hypocrites. Either way, we will probably get it back in the next election.  Although I think Christian morals are a good guide for the country. But, since it is a free country, ""Christianity itself"" can't be the only guide for public policy.  it kind of goes against the constitution.  The thing is, I liked and was fine with Moore or Strange, but I guess I supported moore more because of this subreddit. But, Trump was right, any other republican, including Strange, would have crushed Jones and the democrats should know that. He was a moderate republican. I also am a moderate republican also.  The most important thing from this is we need to shape up. If we don't get ready, we will get destroyed in the midterms, we need to get tax reform passed,(hopefully with a few actually good changes, because the bill is only ok in my eyes, I wanted full expensing). We need to invigorate voters more, because it seems only Trump has the ability to motivate voters in the way he did in 2016. We can't let them do well in 2018. If we do well from now on, we can hopefully keep the majority in the house, and maybe we can keep or increase our senate majority, which will be 51-49 once Jones gets put in.  Anyways, this is my opinion, even though I am just one Trump supporter."

"This basically amounts to a cross-post, but I am afraid that it might go unseen on the original subreddit. Net Neutrality has seen a lot of talk recently, and much misinformation. I hope this can help clear up the topic for some people, and explain as to why Ajit Pai should be *supported*.  (Cross-post begins) I think it is important say this, as the entire conversation around NN has been a huge shit show of misinformation. People **need** to see this post, as I explain an otherwise lengthy document in a succinct, and reassuring manner.    **The bill to repeal Net Neutrality is great, and actually ensures that ISPs can not place priorities on higher paying customers versus lower paying customers.**   [Here is the ruling, which is about 210 pages long.](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)   Why would anybody want the **government**, especially one where you can go from a liberal like Barack Obama, to a populist like Donald Trump, to hold **more** control over the internet? The same government which has agencies that misuse it to unconstitutionally spy on it's people? Whether you like Donald Trump, or you liked Barack Obama, you did not/do not like the government under one of them, and more power for them means they can use it abuse and misuse. Now, complete power to ISPs who just want to make $$$ is not a great idea either, as they are willing to do whatever to make more money, right? So we need a ***hybrid*** with limited gov't (but meaningful) control, and that allows the free market to guide the internet in the direction *we want*. A system where abuses can be fixed, but that also avoids heavy handed control under *constantly changing* administrations.   Excerpt 1: &gt; Consequently, Title II regulation is an unduly heavy-handed approach to what at worst are relatively minor problems. Although the Title II Order argued that ISPs were incentivized to harm edge innovation, it also conceded that ISPs benefit from the openness of the Internet. The Title II Order found that “when a broadband provider acts as a gatekeeper, it actually chokes consumer demand for the very broadband product it can supply.” We agree. The content and applications produced by edge providers often complement the broadband Internet access service sold by ISPs, and ISPs themselves recognize that their businesses depend on their customers’ demand for edge content. It is therefore no surprise that many ISPs have committed to refrain from blocking or throttling lawful Internet conduct notwithstanding any Title II regulation. **Finally, to the extent these economic forces fail in any particular situation, existing consumer protection and antitrust laws additionally protect consumers. We therefore find that Title II, and the attendant utility-style regulation of ISPs, are an unnecessarily heavy-handed approach to protecting Internet openness.**  Excerpt 2:  &gt; In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that harms Internet openness, despite the paucity of evidence of such incidents, we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address such conduct. Other legal regimes—particularly antitrust law and the FTC’s authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices—provide protection for consumers. These long established and well-understood antitrust and consumer protection laws are well-suited to addressing any openness concerns, because they apply to the whole of the Internet ecosystem, including edge providers, thereby avoiding tilting the playing field against ISPs and causing economic distortions by regulating only one side of business transactions on the Internet.  Excerpt 3: &gt; Today’s reclassification of broadband Internet access service restores the FTC’s authority to enforce any commitments made by ISPs regarding their network management practices that are included in their advertising or terms and conditions, as the FTC did so successfully in FTC v. TracFone. The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable. The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.” Today’s reclassification also restores the FTC’s authority to take enforcement action against unfair acts or practices. An unfair act or practice is one that creates substantial consumer harm, is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers, and that consumers could not reasonably have avoided.  Excerpt 4: &gt; Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per se illegal under the antitrust laws. Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which applies if a firm possesses or has a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power, prohibits exclusionary conduct, which can include refusals to deal and exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, and vertical restraints. Section 2 makes it illegal for a vertically integrated ISP to anticompetitively favor its content or services over unaffiliated edge providers’ content or services.   Excerpt 5: &gt; Most of the examples of net neutrality violations discussed in the Title II Order could have been investigated as antitrust violations. Madison River Communications blocked access to VoIP to foreclose competition to its telephony business; an antitrust case would have focused on whether the company was engaged in anticompetitive foreclosure to preserve any monopoly power it may have had over telephony. Whether one regards Comcast’s behavior toward BitTorrent as blocking or throttling, it could have been pursued either as an antitrust or consumer protection case. The Commission noted that BitTorrent’s service allowed users to view video that they might otherwise have to purchase through Comcast’s Video on Demand service a claim that would be considered an anticompetitive foreclosure Comcast also failed to disclose this network management practice and initially denied that it was engaged in any throttling—potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices. **If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix), that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.**  Excerpt 6: &gt; We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to **extravagant statutory power over the national economy** while at the same time strenuously asserting that the authority claimed would render the 'statute unrecognizable to the Congress that designed’ it.”  Excerpt 7: &gt; We also reject AT&amp;T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order. Although AT&amp;T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification,” we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures unnecessary.    Summarized ( **tl;dr**)  * Excerpt 1: The FCC argues that the free market ultimately means that ISPs are going to be financially discouraged from actually hurting the supply of internet access that they provide. Despite this argument, they also add that even if they do throttle speeds, consumer protection laws and anti-trust laws will take over in this case and allow for any wrongs to be made right.  * Excerpt 2: The FTC's power is multivaried, and can ensure that ISPs *and* edge providers (facebook, twitter, youtube, reddit, ect.) are also open to appropriate regulation, so as to avoid unfairly tilting regulation towards ISPs. IMO, this is beneficial as it moves us closer, albeit not significantly, to extending the 1st amendment to the internet.  * Excerpt 3: Basically, ISPs commercials, advertising and Terms and Conditions can not be deceptive, as to do so would fall under unfair-and-deceptive practices and open the ISP to suit by the FTC. They also provide a definition for an ""unfair act"" which is, ""An unfair act or practice is one that creates substantial consumer harm, is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers, and that consumers could not reasonably have avoided.""  * Excerpt 4: Section 1 of the Sherman Act would make throttling or limiting of specific applications illegal, would therefore open an ISP to a suit and is stated by the FCC. Section 2 of the Sherman Act would adequately restrain large corporations like Comcast from favoring it's content over another companies through it's power as an ISP.   * Excerpt 5: Multiple examples are given as to how the FTC could sue companies over activities like throttling. Also, the FCC states that throttling of services like Netflix (literally named) could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.  * Excerpt 6: The FCC states that putting the internet directly into the control of the FCC would give the government control of a significant part of the economy, extravagantly so, and modifies the original piece of legislation to an unrecognizable nature.  * Excerpt 7: AT@T asked the FCC to promise to never bring back Net Neutrality, and make it so that a future FCC can not do it. The FCC is saying fuck off, and that if the FCC wants they can bring back Title II, or Net Neutrality if necessary, meaning that on the off chance that this all goes to hell, Title II can be brought back."

"FBI Agent Peter Strzok is cheating on his wife with an FBI colleague- an attorney named Lisa Page.  They send over 10,000 texts on their government-issued phones about their hatred for Trump and love of Hillary.  Strzok is heading up the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.  Three months before he even conducts her interview, he writes the report exonerating her.   -at the same time-   In the heat of the 2016 election, the DNC, which is currently reporting to the Clinton Campaign,  wants to fabricate a hit on Trump.  They approach notoriously effective oppo-research firm Fusion GPS to do it.  The task is assigned to Nellie Ohr.  Nellie is an expert on Russian intelligence.  Knowing a hit piece would look more authentic if it came from the intelligence world, and knowing anything Russia is titillating, Nellie Ohr hires Christopher Steele, a British ex-spy who freelances, to get Russian dirt of Trump.   Steele compiles his ""Russia Dossier"" which is full of unnamed sources and uncorroborated stories.  He brings it, along with Fusion GPS president and founder Glen Simpson, to the FBI.  The case is handled by Bruce Ohr (who happens to be married to Nellie Ohr...).    The Russia Dossier is leaked to Buzzfeed and CNN.  Bruce Ohr tasks Peter Strzok to investigate.  Bruce Ohr is mysteriously demoted.    Peter Strzok, based on the Russia Dossier, wants a warrant to tap the phones at Trump Towers and specific Trump campaign individuals.  He needs a lawyer to go to the FISA court and secure the warrant.  So he taps his mistress, Lisa Page, who he is already tapping anyway.    Lisa Page secures the warrant.  Phone lines are tapped, and frequently leaked.  Names are ""unmasked"" (meaning -if the government got a warrant to tap your phone, and you are talking to Grandma, and your conversation is not pertinent to the investigation, your grandma's name can't be leaked and her privacy is to be left intact).  Suddenly the FBI is casting doubt on the entire Trump team.   Everyone at the FBI reports to acting AG Rod Rosenstein.   After Trump wins, Rosenstein appoints Mueller to head up the investigation into Trump-Russia collusion, which was created by a fake Dossier, paid for by the Clinton Campaign, brought to the FBI by the wife of the consultant to her own husband and usher through the system by a Hillary support and his mistress girlfriend.    This is what we call DEEP STATE.  And is overly simplistic, of course, but very, very very troubling.    **Edited an incorrect name.  "
"I just got out of Disney's Hall of Presidents show and absolutely loved it with one exception.  I was almost sure it was coming but held out hope that it wouldn't happen but when they got to announcing President Trump about 5 or 6 morons booed.    Thankfully a substantial number more shouted them down with cheers and clapping and the Disney staff member asked for quiet, but I found it extremely unsettling.  Here we are in a place with a lot of Children learning about the history and ideals of our nation and some morons can't help but ruin a really terrific experience with their stupidity.  I know I shouldn't let them bother me, after all they were massively outnumbered by people with some class, but it pissed me off.

"I believe this begins with Sessions as the attorney general pick resulting in the special election in the first place. We haven't seen any major swamp draining from him, but then again maybe he's working in the shadows. The next is that the people of Alabama didn't listen to President Trump when he endorsed and was pushing for Luther Strange. They thought they knew better and went with Moore, so now they pay the price. The fact that Jones won sets a precedent that these sexual assault allegations can work. 2018 will prove to be very interesting. The republican candidates better have the balls to squash the allegations if they are untrue. I honestly can't believe people bought that yearbook scheme, but it worked because of the very low republican turnout. Trump carried the state by 20+ points and a year later they lose to a far left democrat? The next problem to address is Mitch McConnell. He encouraged write ins and was openly against Moore. The GOP is a shit show. And what about the Alabama court order scrapping electronic ballots? Seems like fuckery is afoot considering a 92% democrat turnout and the fact that Moore was up 4-5% until the last 5 minutes. The last thing I want to talk about is why did the President not campaign for Moore Alabama? Jones had so much funding and support. Anyways that's where I'm at right now.

"Congressional bosses from Hell: Sheila Jackson Lee  JONATHAN STRONG    ""A lot of politicians give nicknames to their aides. George W. Bush famously referred to his attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, as “Fredo.” Mitch Daniels, then head of the Office of Management and Budget, was known as “The Blade.” Barack Obama reportedly called Larry Summers, his chief economic advisor, “Dr. Kevorkian.”  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas also hands out nicknames to the people who work for her. The Houston Democrat addressed one of her employees as “you stupid motherfucker.” And not just once, but “constantly,” recalls the staffer, “like, all the time.”  Another Jackson Lee aide recounts the time her parents came to Washington to visit: “They were really excited to come to the congressional office. They’re small town people, so for them it was a huge deal. They were actually sitting in the main lobby waiting area….[Jackson Lee] came out screaming at me over a scheduling change. Called me a ‘stupid idiot. Don’t be a moron, you foolish girl’ and actually did this in front of my parents, of all things.”  Yet another staffer remembers requesting a meeting early on in her tenure to ask how best to serve the congresswoman. Jackson Lee’s response: “What? What did you say to me? Who are you, the Congresswoman? You haven’t been elected. You don’t set up meetings with me! I tell you! You know what? You are the most unprofessional person I have ever met in my life.” With that, Jackson Lee hung up the phone.  According to the same staffer, Jackson Lee “would always say, ‘What am I a prostitute? Am I your prostitute? You can’t prostitute me.’”  Capitol Hill is famous for its demanding, insensitive bosses. Yet even by the harsh standards of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee stands out. She may be the worst boss in Washington. “It’s like being an Iraq War veteran,” says someone who worked for her. Strangers may say, “‘oh I know what you’ve been through.’ No, you really don’t. Because until you’ve experienced it…. People don’t tell the worst of the stories, because they’re really unbelievable.”  Do You Think Sheila Jackson Lee Is The Worst Member Of Congress?   Yes         No         For some, a job in Jackson Lee’s office proved not just emotionally but physically perilous. One staffer recalls a frank conversation with his doctor, who told him he needed to quit. “It’s your life or your job,” the doctor told him, warning that the stress and long hours were wreaking havoc on his body. Only a few on staff fought back. One of Jackson Lee’s drivers became so frustrated with her abuse the person pulled the car over and demand she stop: “She’s screaming and swearing. ‘M.F.’ everything. Finally I slammed on the brakes and told her to get the hell out of my car. I’m like ‘I can’t drive with you like this. Either get out, or you can calm down.’ And she’s like ‘you need to go or get fired.’ I’m like, ‘that’s fine. But I’m either leaving without you or you can calm down,’” the staffer said.  Jackson Lee then threatened to call the police and claim she was being held hostage in the car. But she finally did calm down when the staffer called her bluff, offering to flag down a Capitol Police officer to explain the situation.  Former aide Michael McQueery said his experience with other “difficult” bosses on the Hill prepared him for how to handle Jackson Lee. “I’ve worked for two other members. They did the same thing,” he said.  “It was at first, I’m not going to lie to you, it was a rough patch with her and me. But I took her to the side and I let her know that, you know, ‘Congresswoman, I’m a man before anything else.’ And after that, we had no problems. We had no problems,” McQueery said.  Of the scores of Jackson Lee staffers contacted by The Daily Caller, only McQueery offered an affirmative defense of the congresswoman’s management techniques. “A lot of people just did not know how to go, and say, ‘hey, that’s inappropriate,’” McQueery said.  A congressional torture chamber  In 2007, on a quiet afternoon on the fourth floor of the Rayburn House Office building, Caroline Stephens, then a low-level staffer for California Republican Rep. Gary Miller, walked down the hall to her office, taking note of an open door that was normally closed.  Congress was in recess, and the 535 lawmakers who drive the frenetic pace on Capitol Hill were home in their districts glad-handing constituents. For that reason, the door to Jackson Lee’s office was open and the sounds emanating from inside were pleasant laughter and conversation.  “You could tell when she wasn’t there,” Stephens said. That was because on a day in which Congress was in session, a different set of sounds often came through closed doors to Jackson Lee’s office: screaming and, many times, crying.  Later that day, a skinny young black man with his hair pulled back in a ponytail walked into Miller’s office and asked Stephens for a favor. Could he borrow a knife to cut a birthday cake?  Stephens, who’d seen the man working in Jackson Lee’s office, was happy to help, with only the request to “make sure you bring it back, that’s our only one.”  He laughed. “We would never leave a knife around when the congresswoman was here,” he said. As Stephens put it, “that’s when it all clicked that they are really afraid of her.”  She’ll make you wait  “I am a queen, and I demand to be treated like a queen,” Jackson Lee once said, and apparently she wasn’t kidding. Her employees describe waiting for their boss for hours on end, sometimes late into the night, while she attends events or even sits in her office watching TV.  “You worked really, really, really late for her. When she was in town, you were in the office. So that meant, two, three, four o’clock in the morning – we were there,” one former staffer said.  “She liked to hold her staff meetings — she would individually pull in the deputy chief of staff, myself and some other people individually to go over different parts of her day. But she would literally wait until super late at night. None of us could go home, because she wouldn’t tell when she was coming back or if she wasn’t. And if she called and you didn’t answer, it was like World War III,” the source said.  Jackson Lee’s designated driver picks her up at her apartment one block from her office each morning and waits for her outside wherever she goes throughout the days and nights.  “Whatever time she told me to be there, I would always show up at least 20 minutes late, and expect to wait at least 45 minutes,” said one of Jackson Lee’s drivers. By the end of this person’s tenure, “She was making me wait in the car, sometimes upwards of five to seven hours per day.” With the car running for heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, it began to wear down the car’s engine. “My mechanic friend said, you know, your car looks like you’ve driven it twice the miles you have,” the source said.  One woman who interviewed for a job in Jackson Lee’s office arrived at 5:00 p.m. but ended up waiting for hours. “I sat there, no kidding, from 5:00 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. They had me waiting, and this was just for the interview. Her staffers there kept telling me to be patient, that she puts everyone through the ringer…She actually went out to dinner while I was sitting there waiting for an interview,” the woman said. A Lee staffer called the woman at 11:15 p.m. after she’d just arrived home to beg her to come back. The congresswoman was finally ready.  It wasn’t just staffers who have been made to wait. Ray LaHood, the secretary of transportation, cooled his heels for an hour and a half in her office before leaving. “He was there to address transportation issues – getting funding to Houston. So I was just shocked that she would let him leave,” a former staffer said. Jackson Lee was waiting for a chance to appear in front of the C-SPAN cameras on the House floor.  “I would have to wait for hours,” says Gladys Quinto, a former staffer whom Jackson Lee instructed to write a memo about why she was incompetent in front of other staffers. “I missed the last metro once. My roommate had to come pick me up.”  Nathan Williams, who quit his job when Jackson Lee threw a cell phone at him, told the Houston Chronicle in 2002, “I don’t think I ever got home before 11 o’clock at night.”  The ‘Queen’ doesn’t wait…for anything  Even though she delays others for hours, Jackson Lee won’t wait a second for her demands to be met. “She expected you to run – all the time,” says a former staffer. “There was no walking. Nobody could walk, you always had to run – everywhere. She viewed walking as being lazy, so everyone always had to run.”  Another former aide added that the congresswoman would clock her on how long it took her to run an updated schedule print-out from Jackson Lee’s office in the Rayburn building to the House floor. “She would actually physically time you in terms of from office to getting to the [House] floor and finding her, hunting her down,” the staffer said. Then Jackson Lee would demand, “what took you so long?”  Her former drivers say the congresswoman demanded they run red lights and drive on highway shoulders around traffic. This caused at least one accident. As Jackson Lee was yelling at a staffer to drive faster she turned too sharply, smashing the side of her car into a wall.  Jackson Lee’s requests don’t stop at the end of a normal working day. “In the middle of the night, people had to go get her garlic. She’ll call you at two in the morning for garlic because she takes them as supplements,” a former staffer said. Jackson Lee’s garlic runs were confirmed by other staffers, too, though no one could remember the exact brand of the supplement. The deputy chief of staff “would have to go get it, and he would have to go drop it off. It was some kind of a multi-vitamin,” another former staffer said.  On Christmas Eve, one staffer was at a midnight mass ceremony at her church. When the boss called, the staffer didn’t answer. “She got so irritated that I wasn’t answering her call on Christmas Eve. So she called me every minute for 56 minutes,” the source recalled.  Jackson Lee on race  Jackson Lee has always been quick to assign racism as a motive of her political opponents and others. In 1997, for example, The Hill reported that the newly-elected congresswoman asked NASA officials whether the Mars Pathfinder photographed the American flag astronaut Neil Armstrong had planted on the surface of Mars. When it was pointed out that the flag in question was on the moon, not Mars, Jackson Lee cited bigotry. “You thought you could have fun with a black woman member of the Science Committee,” her then chief of staff wrote in a letter to the editor.  Jackson Lee recently blasted a Pepsi advertisement shown during the Super Bowl in which a black woman throws a can of soda at her husband for ogling an attractive white woman next to them. “It was not humorous. It was demeaning — an African-American woman throwing something at an African-American male and winding up hitting a Caucasian woman,” she thundered from the House floor.  In 2009, she helped prevent Rush Limbaugh from becoming an NFL owner. “He does not represent the fullness of appreciation of athletes of all diverse backgrounds, no matter what he wants to pretend to say on his radio station,” Jackson Lee said.  In 2003, she demanded that more Hurricanes be named with African American-sounding names.  A former staffer recalls one revealing episode during the height of the financial crisis in the waning months of the Bush administration. Jackson Lee demanded a meeting with a top Treasury aide, even though she did not sit on any of the committees with jurisdiction over financial matters. As her car pulled up outside the Treasury, Jackson Lee told her driver to park directly outside the door.  Due to the proximity of the Treasury Department’s headquarters to the White House, Secret Service officers told the driver not to park there. After an argument with the agents, who kept telling the driver to back off, Jackson Lee finally emerged from the building.  As the car drove away, a Secret Service van flashed its lights behind them. “Keep driving,” Jackson Lee told her staffer. Ultimately, the driver pulled over in defiance of the boss’s wishes. At this point, Jackson Lee emerged from the car, screaming, “I’m Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee! Who do you think you are?” to a team of Secret Service agents.  Jackson Lee accused the “white” agent at the gate of racism, claiming she wouldn’t have to deal with “this stuff” when Barack Obama became president. She then filed a formal complaint with the Secret Service, which prompted an investigation. A Treasury official later explained that the accusation had been dismissed because the agent in question was Hispanic, not white.  Given Jackson Lee’s apparent touchiness on racial questions, there’s a certain irony in the fact that aides claim she is far harsher to the African Americans who work for her. “’You stupid mother-effer’ was like a constant,” says one. “Like, all the time. But the interesting thing is she would really project that behavior more towards her African American staffers. She would have other ethnic groups in the office, like interns or whatnot. But it was really her African American staffers who she felt comfortable enough to really curse out…. This is something we always talked about. We chalked it up to her just feeling more comfortable acting out her aggression toward a certain group of people versus others.”  “She is very strange in who she insults and how. For some reason, it seemed like she was racist against African Americans,” another said.  Why she would come down harder on black staff was one of many mysteries that provoked endless speculation from those subject to her abuse.  “We would sit around and try to analyze why she was so miserable,” a former staffer said, “We all kind of felt bad for her. She was such a lonely, miserable person. And it must suck to work on Capitol Hill and have all of your colleagues hate you, right?”  The good, the bad, and the zany  And yet for all the nastiness, Jackson Lee also exhibits a zany side. She regularly asks that documents be printed in different colors. She has staff drive her from the Rayburn building to the Cannon building to attend homeland security hearings. She sometimes demands two staffers in two cars pick her up from the airport, one for her, the other for her luggage. On one occasion, she demanded an aide wear a green hat when picking her up.  One day in March of 2004, Jackson Lee told colleagues on her hall in Rayburn that the corridor would be closed from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to accommodate her visit from Michael Jackson. The House Administration Committee promptly informed her that she had no authority to close a public hallway.  Staffers describe Jackson Lee as a hoarder. For example, she keeps over twenty boxes of the book “Black Americans in Congress” in her office, hundreds of copies in all. From time to time, she adds new copies of the same book to her collection.  Aides who’ve worked for Jackson Lee for years will call her on her cell phone and, despite the caller ID on her blackberry, she invariably answers, “This is Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.” When getting into the car in the morning, she will give her aide directions to the Rayburn building one block away, even if the aide has been driving her there every morning for months or years.  Jackson Lee’s speeches are frequent and eccentric enough to have occasioned a game in other Capitol Hill offices. Every day, one staffer puts money into a Sheila Jackson Lee jar. If she speaks on the House floor, as she usually does, the jar moves to the next desk. On the rare day she doesn’t speak, the staffer holding the jar wins all the money.  It’s funny, but not really  Not surprisingly, Jackson Lee has one of the highest staff turnover rates in Washington. Over the last ten years, at least 39 staffers have left within one year. Over that time, Lee has employed at least nine chiefs of staff, eight legislative directors, and 18 schedulers or executive assistants, according to records of federal disclosure forms published by the website Legistorm. Nine staffers left within two months, 25 within 6 months.  The many veterans of Jackson Lee’s office meet regularly for drinks and stories. We “still get together to have a cathartic release,” says one. “We sit around and tell these stories and just work ourselves into a state of rage.”  Jackson Lee’s view  TheDC made several vigorous attempts to speak to Jackson Lee about her staff’s accounts of life in her office. Jackson Lee made an even more vigorous effort not to answer the questions.  This Monday, after 6:30 p.m. votes, Jackson Lee spoke to an empty House chamber in celebration of African American history month, veering off topic to blast Republicans for trying to cut spending. “Why do you have to have your way or the highway?” she asked.  Afterwards, she went into the Democratic cloakroom, a lobby alongside the House floor where lawmakers often congregate. After half an hour, I checked with the reliably helpful Capitol Hill police and other assorted staff to see if she’d left by another route, but apparently she had not. By this point, the lights in the House floor had been turned off, and every other lawmaker was gone. I knew from my reporting it could be hours. “She’s just sitting in there, forever!” I said to a group of policemen. They laughed knowingly. Finally, I left.  The following day during House votes, Jackson Lee briefly emerged from the House floor with her cell phone in hand. “Congresswoman, I need to interview you,” I said politely. She looked at me, scanning up from my waist to my face, said nothing and hurried back onto the House floor.  Later, she held two meetings in the wood-paneled Rayburn Room. The room has only two exits, one of them into a hallway, the other to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office. As the meeting ended and she got up to leave, a staffer whispered to her. Jackson Lee walked quickly toward Pelosi’s office. “Congresswoman! Congresswoman! Congresswoman Jackson Lee!” I said. She muttered something about a “meeting” and escaped into the office.  Finally, I went to Jackson Lee’s own office in the Rayburn building. Her press secretary was not available. I spoke instead to a woman at the front desk, explaining that I had spoken with many of the congresswoman’s former aides, most of whom had damning things to say about Jackson Lee. The woman laughed. She knew all about the article. I gave her my cell phone number, but Jackson Lee never called.""  http://archive.is/YnWMw"

"[Luke 3:3-9 NLT] Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven. Isaiah had spoken of  John when he said,  “He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the LORD’s coming! Clear the road for him! The valleys will be filled, and the mountains and hills made level. The curves will be straightened, and the rough places made smooth. And then all people will see the salvation sent from God.’”   When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, “You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee God’s coming wrath? Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones. Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.”"

"Ex-moose here. My parents came to America from Pakistan in the 70s legally!! Was born in early 80s, parents raised me as a Muslim which I rejected in my teens.   Fast forward, to Trumps campaign. Nobody in my family or extended family believed in Trump. I was the only one. My long time best friend, my cousin, who I’ve known since I was a toddler. We ended up stop talking and fighting because of how pro Trump I was. I got into fights with my brother. The only person that ever heard me out was my cousins  younger brother. To this day I still don’t know his true stance I just know I red pilled my heart out to him daily during the campaign and he never argued back or showed disagreement on ANY of my statements. One time he told me that only reason he didn’t argue was because he didn’t want to make me mad lol he said he was joking later (we might have been fighting at that time but don’t remember) so not sure of his true stance.   There were times I even hesitated on my own stance during the campaign since I didn’t know what was true, nobody else on my side. I used to monitor Trumps Facebook and Twitter as well as Hillary’s during the campaign. I used to compare his likes and positive comments compared to Hillary’s and I felt like it was true and gave me hope, his likes destroyed Hillary’s no matter what the comments said I looked at the actual numbers, I saw the silent majority. Again the media and my immediate family and extended family all against. It’s just me against the world. I never gave up. I never lost hope. I always believed.   Now the world is starting to see the real Trump. The person I always believed in, who gave me hope. The message I heard and felt from him was truth and not lies. The world is starting to see. As he said we are going to keep winning. Not even a year in office and he’s doing an excellent job as I believed and hoped. He is who he said he was.   My birthday is in 2 days. This has been an awesome way to close out the year.

Yeah, you eat your words. Fucking priceless.  Showings signs of admission that Trump is the real deal is priceless. Here’s to the underdog. Way to go Trump. Never giving up. I swear with the world against you and lies and hate every where you turn and never giving up and standing up to the hate. Shows so much character and impressiveness, motivation and hope. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from him, never give up against all odds, always believe in yourself and stand up for yourself. I’m tearing now lol   MAGA   God bless America. Merry Christmas.

It would be interesting to note how many times since the election we have caught CNN lying. Even more in depth would be to look at how long it takes them to retract or update an incorrect article about conservatives as compared to any other correction they make. 
"If I am correct, wasn't the House supposed to vote on Reciprocity a little while ago? Perhaps I am wrong and they did not, but I though I read something about it. Additionally, anyone have any information on the Constitution Convention? I thought they only needed a few more states."
"https://berniesanders.com/press-release/clinton-dnc-joint-fundraising-raises-serious-campaign-finance-concerns/  ""She stole millions in donations and cheated tens of millions of dollars into her campaign's pockets."""
"You 'pedes are family and wish you all a very Merry Christmas! Love ya!  74% upvoted. Go to hell, ShariaBlue!"
"She was so excited, and I look at her with a “no shit “ face and say, “Now I know you hate the man, but do you think ANY of that has to do with the president?” She says no. Instead of laughing hysterically ... I calmly rephrase my question pointing out that the stock market’s strength depends on consumer confidence, do you think Trump has had any effect on that by cutting regulations and talking about a huge tax cut for a year?”   She meekly responds, “Yes.”  Red pilled my liberal mother-in-law.   JOY JOY JOY!����"
It’s on their video about the bakery fine being upheld. Really out of the blue but I couldn’t find any more info. Can anyone else confirm?
"I hope you all have a great day! For those of you who do not recognize or celebrate Christmas, please accept my heartfelt wishes that today you are safe, happy and surrounded by the people you want to be with."
"Can we get somewhere to list every positive benefit that is a result of the tax cuts all in one place? I can't believe I'm *still* having to argue with people that LESS TAXES is a good thing; I've heard ""they're going to go up in 7 years"", ""Obamacare will collapse"", ""the IRS will collapse"" etc etc.   Fucking liberals man."
That would just about do it.
and one little tiny suicide pistol just in case some hero like Jesus Campos came knocking at the door
"I am all for helping people in dire situations. However, if you push your raising tax agenda by demonizing the productive people then you are just a bunch of scumbags to me  Work on changing your message you low life scum"
........he was made aware of these things so he thought we should all know too.
"If we ridicule and name call, then we are no better than them.  With all of the positive boons that will come from these tax cuts(and are already) - we have to let them have their tantrums and then speak to them rationally and with solid facts and numbers and show them that you can't spur an economy by taxing the hell out of everybody.  We must give them the opportunities to come to these conclusions on their own.  We are better than that. We are not petulant children.  We are inspired patriots that want them to share in our happiness and wealth.  We WANT to bring them along for the MAGA ride!  REMEMBER, FELLOW 'PEDES - TAKE THE HIGH ROAD, ALWAYS"
"He said we would get tired of winning, but I'm not tired of it yet!"
"As a liberal, the worst you're going to get is an insult. I hope you can survive that. As a republican, I could receive far worse because people just think you're stupid, whereas I'm thought of as evil."
"You cannot be the dominant culture and counter culture at the same time. You can't run Hollywood/entertainment, 99 percent of our media and academia and think you're fighting ""the machine."" YOU ARE THE MACHINE.""  When your political views gets you lauded and adored and you parrot all of the talking points you hear and risk nothing with your views, you aren't brave. MAGA is brave. "

Every top Dem made statements about the President wanting to fire Mueller.
I posted in a private closed group of friends my opinion of my Senators' efforts to block the tax bill. I said that Senator X was behaving like a cuck waiting for the left wing establishment bull to show up and the citizens of this country were in the role of his' wife.   Boom 24 hour ban.

If you could also adjust the sister subs as well?  I know I'm not the only one who struggles with this....am I pedes?
"Do you guys think 2018 will be the year we win *less*? I mean, it's not realistically possible to expect even more winning.. Is it?  Any decent mortal would be tired of winning so much. I'm worried."

"Back in the 1940's the U.S. Government sold War Bonds to finance WWII.  Since the Never Trumper's and the Democrat's say we can't afford to build the wall, Trump and the Treasury should sell a limited supply of WALL BONDS.  Set the number at $25 Billion with a 2-3% interest rate payable in three or five years. They can only be bought by American Citizens no foreign sales. Set the denominations at $25, $50, $100, $500, and $1000.   I bet a lot of those bonds would never get turned in for redemption because at lot of people would be framing them to hang on their walls.  The money goes into the Wall building account and no one in the Congress is allowed anywhere near that money."
"It's just a question. It's not a gotcha. It's not rhetorical. I just want to know because I'm somewhat uninformed. Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, the one with hair that looks like ramen noodles ... Are there any Democrats who specifically said that they are pro open borders, and not just anti-Wall or pro-Daca or whatever. I just want to know what I'm talking about. Source would also be appreciated if you have one. -Thanks."

"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-dow-crash-another-25-jump-no-heres-the-case-for-a-market-freeze-in-2018-2017-12-21   He cites Fibonacci Extensions, which is a popular analytics tool used by traders to try and predict future market moves, as the reason for his claim.   The only problem is this: He discounts the fact that this is a HISTORIC tax reform bill. This isn't some lipstick-on-a-pig, bait-and-switch RINO bill that promises more than it will deliver. This is the real deal-- delivered at the end of a year that chronicled a historic economic reversal.   The American economy is being turned back on for the first time in decades. There are middle-aged citizens who will experience for the first time what it is truly like to live in a thriving economy that elevates the entire middle class. (Unlike the DotCom and Housing bubbles of the 2000's, which were nothing more than facades, or even Reagan's Recovery, which boosted many sectors, but still left manufacturing--i.e. the working class-- behind.)  I don't necessarily fault this guy for publishing this article. His job is to advice people on the stock market, and being a scared little bitcc, he is not going to make any of the bold claims that I have alluded to above. He undoubtedly recognizes the immense potential that these tax cuts present-- given the fact that he is calling for a freeze rather than a crash.   However, I am sick and tired of ""people"" having little to no faith in America and its citizens. The restrictor plates have been taken off. If we want to floor it, and are willing to put in the work, there isn't a soul or ""Market-Maker""--as the manipulative assholes who control Wall Street are called-- that can stop us.  Get out of the way or you will be flattened on the track, and nobody will come looking for you.   Spez: To bring it full circle-- you cannot use conventional analytics as a means of prediction for this incoming economy. It will be unlike anything seen since the 1950's, and hopefully better. To try and contain it into your nice little model is foolhardy at best. The time for playing scared is over. "
"[Luke 3:10-14 NLT] The crowds asked, “What should we do?”   John replied, “If you have two shirts, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry.”   Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked, “Teacher, what should we do?” He replied, “Collect no more taxes than the government requires.”   “What should we do?” asked some soldiers. John replied, “Don’t extort money or make false accusations. And be content with your pay.”"
Its getting too easy! LOL  They quickly changed the subject to fucking basketball.
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 
"Don’t forget pedes, past presidents have left the Oval Office with large sums of money in their pockets, and the American people are left with no money in our pockets. Trump, is leaving oval office with $8 dollars, we the American people are receiving (have a great opportunity) the money now.  Just Really think about that for a moment. "
Still haven’t seen anything on why
"I don't know how he did it, maybe it was his encouragement. Maybe it's been the economy. Maybe some sort of combination of the two or more variables. Somehow Mr. Trump has reinvigorated Christmas in this country and I have loved it. I hope and believe the new year as well will be a fun holiday to celebrate. Hanukkah, Kwanzaa.. whatever way that you connect with your fellow human is cool with me. Have a great holiday season and Merry Christmas to our country."
"I wore a stealthy infowars shirt to a large city in California. At a glance it appears to promote Antifa, but when it’s read closely it is clearly Americana.   It started conversations! A couple distant snickers, but even those turned into admiration I think when they saw me interacting with my family, especially handling young children and their behaviors. Like, when you’re at the market and notice a parent properly redirecting/positively parenting their child? You kind of nod and smile. That’s the way to raise a human being.   Back to the story: a cashier was ringing me up and gasped after realizing what my shirt said. He was like, “Oh my god, I thought you were antifa,” and he sighed in relief.   He shook his head, looking side to side, and stated he believes “There are way, WAY more Trump supporters and America lovers in California than people realize,” - THAT IS AWESOME TO HEAR!  #MAGA"
"A video of ISIS chopping someone’s head off. It’s almost like if you BOMB THE SHIT OUT OF AN ENEMY, they die and have trouble recruiting new members because no one else wants to be blown the fuck up. And Christians can move back to Syria without having to worry about being beheaded.  “But but but what “Magic Wand” does Trump have for defeating ISIS??”  #OBAMA IS A FUCKING DISGRACE! WORST MILITARY “LEADER” OF ALL TIME."

Just kidding.  Nothing changed at all because Net Neutrality was bs.
I have been seeing people saying this for the past few days? Does this mean ISIS’ military regiment has been defeated? I’m generally just confused.  I’m sure a lot of ppl read that and confuse ISIS with radical Islam which could be misleading 
"I just found out that my city in Palm Beach County is a sanctuary city. The mayor worded it as a “Welcoming City” (I’m assuming to appeal to our hospitality industry), but it’s just doublespeak.   The neighborhood next to mine has had a number of break-ins recently and someone had mentioned this fact and that might be why the police are so slow to respond. I have noticed an increase in homeless, panhandlers, and Hispanic loiterers downtown. The local children’s playgrounds have makeshift beds in them.   I feel like my property taxes are high enough (homes are anywhere from $300k to $2mil) that this wouldn’t be an issue, but I’m apparently wrong. Can anyone point me in the right direction? "
"We're going to do so much winning, we're going to get tired of winning. :-) Well, I'm not tired of winning but enjoying each new win.   Thanks be to the God Emperor and to all of you who supported him, blindly at times, as is warranted due to his holiness.   Anyway, I just needed to high five someone today because Trump looked like a total bad ass signing the tax bill today.   Cleaned up Syria. Threw a bunch of human trafficers in jail,  started work on the wall, and now passed tax cuts along with some Obamacare shut down provisions.  The dude is really making America great again.   Someone cue the Rocky theme song. Let's go win the fucking winter Olympics now!!!   U S A!   U S A!   U S A!!"

I'm putting my money on David Muir. Dude has a huge ego. 
So they are crying injustice and each item I looked at are either flat out lies or great ideas. Sincerely hope local tax and property tax and interest rates deduction are all gone gone gone and California will go to hell for it. Top bracket will be 50% without local tax deduction in California. 
"Fellow pedes, I want to donate money to Trump campaign, ideally not to GOP. Is there a way to do it? Is there a way to minimize money to gop but to djt? If I use those Trump emails to donate, where does the money go?  Thank you."
"The left stacked the deep state with cronies to protect them and they destroyed the credibility of the organization. There are an army of lawyers out there getting ready to spring some really bad people from prison by questioning the agencies that investigated them. Sad to say the DEA and ATF are in the same boat.  On the other hand I now understand Gitmo, and why Obama wanted bring them into US prisons. Bush didn't want to risk letting enemy fighters get released if the deep state failed. Obama wanted to make sure they would. Neither of them wanted to out the fact the UniParty, New World Order, or whatever you want to call it, have been firmly in control of deep state for decades. Corruption.   No wonder Hillary was so worried about all these traitors being hung, it's her and all her friends.   Obamas first act as president? Ordered Gitmo closed. It's still operating. Total failure by the way."
Dershowitz took the redpill !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!!!!!!!!
DUMB ASSES.  Fugly bitch Behar is shaking.
Nazi facist Democrats immediately move to impeach.
Everyone of these people should know what its like. 
Would get us 50 votes plus the VP tie.
"This is what happens when you let large numbers of people who don't share American values into America. The people don't change, America does. Kate Steinle is not only a victim of Mexican Crime, she is a victim of Mexican Values."
"Another anecdotal glimpse into inane, leftist logic...  Work at a fun, diverse, family-like office in New York. Our holiday party is always a big, fun night and our awesome founders provide free breakfast the following morning for everyone who shows up for a brunch-time continuation of the fun.   This year, the plan was to rally at the office where Chick Fil A would be waiting for everyone. Until today, when a 5pm-email is sent out as most people are gone for the weekend...   ""It's been brought to our attention that Chik-Fil-A has a pretty checkered past and doesn't align with the POV (of inclusivity and diversity) that we champion as a company -- so we've cancelled our food with them...""  I responded instantly to the founders shocked at the disgustingly dangerous precedent they've just presented, as well as with links detailing Chick Fil A's support after the Orlando massacre, a fundraise for LGBT youth in Hollywood and a change in donation policy.   Now, I honestly don't fucking care about what kind of chicken biscuit I get to eat when I'm wildly hungover next Friday, but good god – a company that makes amendments anytime anyone is offended is a company that will be both saturated and held hostage by political correctness in the near future.   Super disappointing end to my Friday...  "
This is the last connection the Democrats and specifically Mueller have to connect Trump to Russia and its absolutely pitiful. They have nothing left. After Trump emerges from this unscathed more people will be red pilled then ever about the Russian collusion narrative.   Even better this is likely the end of Mueller's investigation towards Republicans since nobody else has any ties to Russia. The next person arrested will be a Democrat. The real Russian collusion is about to be exposed.   This is the last day the left gets to celebrate about the Russian collusion narrative bringing Trump down. It is over. Everything is about to be flipped on its head. With 4000 sealed indictments right now and rising the floodgates are about to be opened.   DRAIN THE SWAMP 
#FUCKING TRUTH
Praise Papi Trump
"This all reads like a complete propaganda stunt to try to put everyone in fear of the dreaded global warming. What about the other reasons all those fires might be happening? We used to ask WHY, but now they just blame Global Warming. Here is an idea, why don't you clear the underbrush, do controlled burns, and properly manage your forests and wildlands California? Oh yeah, and look into the KOOKs and find out who is flicking matches out the car windows! Geez, look a Fire! It must be Global Warming! Give me a BREAK! ...Yes, I know I left out the obvious suspects, but this is Reddit, I'll leave the fun to everyone else."
"After months of fake sexual assault claims, Roy Moore is still standing.  Dont give up the fight.  Vote today and destroy the MSM"
"For such a long time, i was in a loop of just looking at /all and some random subs. Liberals would infest these subs and constantly i would feel so down because it felt like nobody agree'd with me even when i tried to be civil, it never changed my mind but it did change my name. I adopted the name BlackSheepwnoSoul because of my constant negative interactions with them.  Today i feel like i can finally say that this name is not as accurate, my soul feels better, and my days are much more uplifted thanks to the ""pedes"". I may not always agree with you guys, but you have been civil and kind to me every day, and you actually show me the good things DT does. and it uplifts me. Thanks!"
Just noticed a couple days ago. Normally there's always something from T_D at the top. Now nothing shows up.
FREE IRAN!!!!!!!  FREE THE ENSLAVED!!!!!!!  LET FREEDOM RING!!!!  Fuck the Globalists!!! 
Now what does that vile woman Gloria Allred do? Her client has already buckled on her. I assume she is next to get sued by Roy Moore for defamation.  *I am not a lawyer

I am getting antsy.
What's she rambling about??
Has anyone heard what her gripe is with President Trump? Does she even know? Anyone have a list of her sponsors?  She was wearing a Red Bull's cap while disrespecting our president. Red Bull is Dead Bull to me
And old man McCain is such a turncoat that he got confused. 
**How is any of this illegal?**  * 12/28: Obama signs additional sanctions against Russia  * 12/28: Russian Ambassador Kislyak contacts incoming National Security Adviser Flynn  * 12/29: Russian sanctions go into effect  * 12/29: Flynn and senior transition official (unknown) agree they don't want Russia to escalate  * 12/29: Flynn asks Russian Ambassador to ask Russian officials not to escalate in response to sanctions imposed by Obama  * 12/30: Putin's statement indicates Russia will scale back retaliation against the United States in response to Obama's additional sanctions  * 12/30: Trump praises Putin on Twitter for delaying his retaliatory sanctions against the United States  * 12/31: Russian Ambassador informed Flynn that Russia chose not to retaliate in response to his request  
"Up front. I'm sorry if this is rambling. I made a lot of edits and something might not be where it originally was. I did a quick readthrough and it looks fine, I think.  So, there's a lot of speculation on the 4,000 sealed indictments and what that means. I wrote a reply to someone in another thread about this because I looked into it a few weeks ago. I'm going to give my opinion which could be totally wrong, but I think has some merit. Feel free to disagree, ask questions, add to it, or whatever. I am not a lawyer and this is just what I have found.  **Most important part, imo**: Unfortunately, the report I'm basing this all on states that they only saw if the cases were sealed **at the time they pulled the report**. So, if it was filed sealed and then unsealed when the reason for it to be sealed wore off (eg, the defendant got sentenced or whatever), the case wouldn't have been counted in the numbers. What we're looking at now in most cases are sometimes only filed like that day. So, all of these could be unsealed when the trial starts for all we know.  &gt;Using CM/ECF data, we identified every case filed in every district in 2006, and we identified which cases were sealed when we looked at the database.  ...  &gt;The research, therefore, reflects cases sealed approximately two years after filing.    ------------  With that in mind...  2006 had 576 sealed civil cases, and 15,177 sealed Magistrate cases, and 1,077 sealed criminal cases total. 39% of the Magistrate cases were not filed on EM/ECF and we have no idea if this continues or not. These 4,000 or whatever they're up to now are from mid-early October until now or a couple weeks ago depending on when they pulled the data - so at most ~2 months.   On Magistrate cases-there were 15,177 of those in 2006, but the report says that 39% were not in CM/ECF (where people are getting the data from). So, that would have been ~9,250 in CM/ECF.   Assuming that those same scenarios of not putting the sealed cases in CM/ECF (which is a big assumption), that brings the total of Magistrate, Civil, and Criminal sealed cases to 10,903 in 2006 or 908 per month. Let's assume people are running the reports for all of October and November and that would have been 1,816 in 2006. So, roughly double now, but if we assumed that all Magistrate cases were now in CM/ECF, that comes out to 1,402 per month or 2,800 in 2006. Not really that big of a difference, imo. It's also hard to tell because we only have 1 data set (2006).  Because the people (Twitter, /pol/, etc) that are looking into it just post a screenshot of a spreadsheet instead of posting the data so that other people can look at it, we have no idea what cases they are looking at. It would be nice to see if there were thousands of criminal cases for instance...  Also, I went and pulled a bunch of data a couple weeks ago. I got 258 criminal cases in a 3 week period. I also couldn't check 17 district courts (1 of which was DC) because I ran out of the $15 limit before they charge you. So, that's like half of 2006's total in just 3 weeks and not including 17 courts... Take that as you will. Maybe I'll upload the data this weekend if there's interest and I can strip my personal info from it.  Source: http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/sealed-cases.pdf "
Does that mean we lost.  EDIT: I'm talking about Net Neutrality. I saw [this post](https://imgur.com/a/E5ibu#BwKz5fW) which got my attention.

"Why don't we have something akin to this for today's LEGAL immigrants?  https://culturismnews.blogspot.com/2008/04/americanization-movement.html  &gt; From immigrants she expected love of America manifest in attempts to learn English, pass naturalization exams and generally celebrate their new nation. She pushed American mores, values and standards of cleanliness. America had to provide opportunities and immigrants had to accept them. Thus Kellor utilized both progressive and nationalist tactics in the pursuit of unity.  &gt; Academics today hold the Americanization in low regard.

"Please Mr. Mueller and kangaroo company. Please go easy on me, I'll even testify in court to other people I know whom have talked to Russians once in their lives. In the meantime your ""Russian hacking of our election"" wasn't a hack. It was a LEAK. FROM THE INSIDE. "

He has the power to pardon.  Trump knows this is a completely bullshit charge.  He should pardon Flynn and declare war on the fucking horse face Mueller and his entire deep state crew.  We the people will not stand for this.

They literally shadow ban anything but the same views. It’s terrifying. 
That's the price to abandon your morals and become a subversive traitor 
"Isn't it interesting that Trump hater FBI boss agent gets ""leaked"" to a deep state favorite paper the NYT? This avoids a potential big announcement by Nunes? Nunes who requested the same information for months but was stonewalled even though he had to threaten bringing contempt charges against Rosenstein and Wray. And it gets leaked only days after Flynn already plead guilty and cannot use this new information to improve his defense against a clearly politically motivated abusive prosecution and a tainted process? "
"Because I'm Strayan.  Oi cunts, long time lurker checking in. Keep doing what you're doing."
Interesting to say the least.  It seems these Women are much more informed or because of their jobs actually learn about the Procedures that need to be done.  You watch these hearings as long as I have and it is apparent most of these idiots must rely on multiple people just to know what to say.
"Twitter has killed a large number of users' follow buttons. I see this happening a lot to users promoting Trump. This search yields that the top results are *mostly* Pro-Trump, with things like ""MAGA"" in their profile. A few are hillbots, but I'm going to chalk this up to a shoddy algorithm. Check it out: https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%22no%20follow%20button%22&amp;src=typd  I think we ought to make sure people know what is going on."
"Before one of Obama's speeches, someone in the audience asked him a question about something and Obama replied ""I never said I'd keep all my promises"". I heard it clearly, but I can't find it anywhere. I wish I'd recorded the speech."

Try looking for a picture Strzok’s supposed wife Melisa Hodgman.  The only picture found from a google image search links to this person http://www.cj-lake.com/lynnette-r-jacquez/   Lisa Page image search, google or otherwise - good luck.  The guy seems to be involved at every key turn in the Clinton email/Russia Hack/Pee Pee Dossier narrative.  Who could he be?"
"""These are terrible tax cuts for the rich!""  Also democrats on Facebook: ""these tax cuts expire  in several years! Bullshit!"""
"I have never been more disgusted with such an injustice since the Casey Anthony case. California I hope sinks into the fucking sea. Any time somebody tells me online or real life that ""white privilege"" or ""victory against Trump"" argument I say ""FUCK YOU!"" An innocent woman died today and got no justice because the courts were more determined to get a jab at Trump then do the right thing and see this bastard go to jail for his crime. The fact that there were people celebrating this is a big spit on everything we stand for.  And if I heard that ""Well a white man killed all those people in Vegas"" argument I swear I'm going to punch them because A. That man was in sane. B. A leftist. and C. Blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims have done just as bad or worse crimes in the last two years along with that guy.   The only thing I take comfort is that this little so called ""liberal victory"" is another brick in the wall and another reason why we need to win in 2018 and 2020. God bless and good night. "
"We are all sickened and saddened by today’s verdict, and if we do not act on it, her murder will be in vain. We need the wall, we need voter ID, and sanctuary cities must be outlawed. A great start to this is Kate’s Law. The house has already done its job here. I want this Law up for debate and up for a vote in the senate. Let’s get these f*cks on the record; if they do not want to support Kate’s Law, then they are as good as condoning her murder.   -Call your senators -blast them with emails -blast their website contact forms -send them snail mail -meme their position in their state -flood their social profiles -call out any public figure who virtue signals around this issue -educate the masses   Enough is enough. If we do not act on this now, the media will bury this story in less than a week’s time and we will never hear of it again. "

Mad as hell cannot believe the outcome of the decision yesterday by the jury. And the Democrats and stupid liberals wonder why we support Donald Trump and his America first stance. This is 1000% the prime example of why our immigration policies suck. And why we need Trump to fix it and make America first. God bless the family and friends of kate Steinle we are here with you. I will pray for your family and I will pray for all the family’s that have lost loved ones bc of the dumb idiotic immigration policies we have. Thanks to the old Democrats and Obama bc they care more about immigrants then they do actual Americans. All I can say is America 1st America 1st America first. Sorry for whoever down votes this you shouldn’t be on this page anyways.

"You know for the longest time I've always known there was just something irksome about late night talk show hosts in this day and age and how they have such rabid support from liberals and progressives.  I mean enjoying them as entertainment is fine, but these ""fans"" always seem to take it a bit further and idolize them, taking everything they say as true. I knew there was just something so off about that but couldn't pin point what.  Yesterday I finally figured it out.  Everybody can see there is definitely a clear split between liberals and conservatives now, not just in values but in lifestyles as well.  Conservatives are mostly religious while a lot of people on the left are atheists or agnostics.  Now for conservatives, because we ascribe to a faith tradition, we know we can turn to our religious leaders in our church for guidance. Christians go to their priests/pastors, (Jews to Rabbis) when they are having personal problems, need guidance for how not to live a sinful life, when they need moral support, help, and hope etc etc. And additionally we can always reach out to our church community for other sources of support. We have this structure to our lifestyles and this network of support already established in our lives since childhood.   But liberals (esp millennials) don't have any of that. Sure they have friends and family, but many a times that isn't enough. For the most part they don't know who to turn to for support when life gets tough or they are experiencing unrest.   So then who do they turn to?  Late night talk show hosts.   Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver, Trevor Noah, Chelsea Handler etc.  All these people they treat like their priests and they look to them to provide comfort and solace from this evil world (aka living in Trump's America).   The studios are the altars, the audience the congregation, their monologues resemble the sermons pastors give as they reflect on scripture, except these hosts reflect on their Trump news of the day.   Seriously, the similarities are bizarrely accurate where Trump Derangement Syndrome isn't just a meme, it's a religion. It's scary."

If Flynn is our guy and is really a good guy then Trump will pardon him if needs be.    Flynn was fired for lying to Pence.    Flynn is now in trouble for lying to the FBI.     His fate is tied to the collection of his past deeds and his ability to make recompense. 
"I feel so lost regarding politics, being a firm supporter of Trump I still lack confidence regarding my views. How did the world get here? As a South African (born 1985) my theory has always been liberals have been looking at sociology from their wooden cladded offices in universities without understanding how it would play out in practice. Multiculturalism looks great in theory but it is simply unnatural in my opinion. "
"While our liberal friends are circle jerking harder than ever about Flynn STUPIDLY lying to the FBI.  We get Tax Reform....ask yourself this....how did they catch Flynn's lie?

"""From today's perspective, nearly a year later, it has become apparent that, farfetched as it might seem, the Logan Act made it possible for the Obama administration to go after Trump. The ancient law that no one has ever been prosecuted for violating was the Obama administration's flimsy pretense for a criminal prosecution of the incoming Trump team.  And by the way, when it finally came time to charge Flynn with a crime, did prosecutors, armed with the transcripts of those Flynn-Kislyak conversations, choose to charge him with violating the Logan Act? Of course not. But for the Obama team, the law had already served its purpose, months earlier, to entangle the new administration in a criminal investigation as soon as it walked in the door of the White House.""  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-in-trump-russia-probe-was-it-all-about-the-logan-act/article/2642434 "

HRC fusion GPS dossier used for Russia collusion investigation 2. 16 months of investigation including 6 months of special prosecutor, No Russian collusion found  3. Trump will be investigate for obstruction of justice on a investigation into Russian collusion.  4. So obstructing a non investigation.. NO?? 5. Obstructing an investigation into Flynn 6. Flynn being investigated for Russian collusion based on illegal FISA obtained with HRC dirty dossier 7. Trump asking Comey to stop Flynn investigation is obstruction of justice  8. But Trump as Comey's boss has the authority to order Comey to stop it 9. Comey did not... in other words Trump did not give Comey an order. 10. Comey never claimed to disobey an order  So to sum it up, investigation into obstruction of justice by obstructing an investigation into a person colluding with Russia based on flimsy opposition research paid for by the Democrats that has yielded no evidence in 16 months of intense investigation by Deep-state, US gov, world wide media and deep state allies around the world.   If this is what they use to bring down Trump it truly is the end of the road for western civilisation"

"It appears Democrats don't want to discuss Bill or Hillary Clinton, but do want to discuss say Roy Moore. A number of youtube and online articles written over the past few days seem to have a DNC talking point ""in the moment"" meaning we can't talk about Bill or Hillary as they aren't doing anything ""in the moment"" however Roy Moore is ""in the moment"" and can be discussed.   Do Republicans plan to not seat Roy Moore because he is in the moment?? "
"Tomorrow he's apparently going to resign and he should because he's a piece of shit but resist the urge to spike the football at the ""scalp"" from the Dems. They're only sacrificing him to give them a fantasy moral high ground they'll use against the GOP from here on out.  The Democrats only care about power and because their ideas are so terrible they can't run on them and they know it. Their only weapon is character destruction by any means necessary. They know the ""racist, sexist, homophobe"" crap doesn't work anymore so they're moving to ""every GOP candidate is a sexual assaulter. EVERY Trump candidate in 2018 will have some woman from 20 years ago say he grabbed their ass and must drop out.  They want you to yell and celebrate the scalp but don't allow yourself to do it because he isn't resigning because he's a terrible person. It's only to use for future attacks."

"Not my favorite person, but...  By Charles Krauthammer (UNCONFIRMED) OR POSSIBLY PARAPHRASED FROM PAUL SPERRY ""I do not understand how living in a country with its democracy established over 200 years ago, and now, for the first time in history, suddenly we have one of our former presidents set up a group called ""Organizing for Action"" (OFA).  OFA is 30,000+ strong and working to disrupt everything that our current president’s administration is trying to do. This organization goes against (our Democracy) *Republic--My change*, and it is an operation that will destroy our way of governing. It goes against our Constitution, our laws, and the processes established over 200 years ago. If it is allowed to proceed then we will be living in chaos very much like third world countries are run. What good is it to have an established government if it is not going to be respected and allowed to follow our laws?  If you had an army some 30,000 strong and a court system stacked over the decades with judges who would allow you to break the laws, how much damage could you do to a country? We are about to find out in America!  Our ex-president said he was going to stay involved through community organizing and speak out on the issues and that appears to be one post-administration promise he intends to keep. He has moved many of his administration's top dogs over to Organizing for Action.  OFA is behind the strategic and tactical implementation of the resistance to the Trump Administration that we are seeing across America, and politically active courts are providing the leverage for this revolution. OFA is dedicated to organizing communities for ""progressive"" change. Its issues are gun control, socialist healthcare, abortion, sexual equality, climate change, and of course, immigration reform.  OFA members were propped up by the ex-president's message from the shadows: ""Organizing is the building block of everything great we have accomplished Organizers around the country are fighting for change in their communities and OFA is one of the groups on the front lines. Commit to this work in 2017 and beyond.""  OFA's website says it obtained its ""digital"" assets from the ex-president's re-election effort and that he inspired the movement. In short, it is the shadow government organization aimed at resisting and tearing down the Constitutional Republic we know as AMERICA.  Paul Sperry, writing for the New York Post, says, “The OFA will fight President Donald Trump at every turn of his presidency and the ex-president will command them from a bunker less than two miles from the White House.""  Sperry writes that, “The ex-president is setting up a shadow government to sabotage the Trump administration through a network of non-profits led by OFA, which is growing its war chest (more than $40 million) and has some 250 offices nationwide. The OFA IRS filings, according to Sperry, indicate that the OFA has 32,525 (and growing) volunteers nationwide. The ex-president and his wife will oversee the operation from their home/ office in Washington DC.  Think about how this works.. For example: Trump issues an immigration executive order; the OFA signals for protests and statements from pro-immigrant groups; the ACLU lawyers file lawsuits in jurisdictions where activist judges obstruct the laws; volunteers are called to protest at airports and Congressional town hall meetings; the leftist media springs to action in support of these activities; the twitter sphere lights up with social media; and violence follows. All of this happens from the ex-president's signal that he is heartened by the protests.  If Barack Obama did not do enough to destroy this country in the 8 years he was in office, it appears his future plans are to destroy the foundation on which this country has operated on for the last 241 years.  If this does not scare you, then we are in worse trouble than you know. So, do your part. You have read it, so at least pass this on so others will know what we are up against. We are losing our country and we are so compliant. We are becoming a ""PERFECT TARGET"" for our enemy!""

"So recently my facebook has been flooded with news that the evil Donald Trump is shutting down a national park!  However, not being a typical leftist, I decided to do 5 seconds of research before getting enraged and mashing the ""reshare"" button.  What I found in those 5 seconds was startling!  The first paragraph of the wiki:  &gt;Bears Ears National Monument is a United States National Monument located in San Juan County in southeastern Utah, **established by President Barack Obama by presidential proclamation on December 28, 2016**. The monument protects 1,351,849 acres (547,074 ha) of public land surrounding the Bears Ears, a pair of mesas.  So basically, over a million acres that had no business ever being a national monument in the first place, lame duck Obama made it happen *after* Trump had already won the election, knowing that Trump would be forced to undo the stupid proclamation and they'd be able to piss on him for it.  A quick trip in my handy-dandy-time machine allowed me to travel to a timeline where Hillary won the election (a very depressing timeline for sure, SAD!) where I confirmed that in that timeline, Obama never made that useless land a national monument in the first place.  It was a political cheap shot against an incoming President and nothing more."

"No more plea deals means no more ""climbing the ladder"" by attacking lesser players to build up to someone big. The defense would have every right to crosd examine the investigators at trial to expose this bias as well; there's no doubt the jury would be allowed to hear it.   Think back to the OJ Simpson trial. All of the evidence pointed to OJ as the murderer, but he was acquitted. Most people remember Cochran's ""if the glove doesnt fit, you must acquit"" line as the main reason OJ walked, but it wasn't. A much bigger issue was that one of the detectives on the case used racist language against blacks. The defense used his anti-black bias to suggest he was motivated to convict OJ because of race. It worked."

"Right now, you can watch as fake news and downright falsified stories are being broadcast through pretty much every outlet, including the massive web of social media.   Peoples lives are being destroyed, careers dismantled, and politics are infiltrating every aspect of society in the US.   The country is being divided by puppet masters who have figured out that they can run a full on propaganda machine and get away with it. The communists that have subverted our nation are starting to literally pull out the same old tricks of ""accusations"" to silence, defeat, and destroy their political enemies.   Politicians, CEOs of media corporations, and the plethora of 501c3 political action organizations are an entirely separate class of citizen now, completely and utterly untouchable by the rule of law, which has been mocked and watered down into a mere shadow of what it used to be.   The court of public opinion is in full swing and mock trials in this court are being held daily to prove that guilty-until-proven-innocent is the new standard.   When are we going to get a handle on this fucking shit? I for one, am totally FED UP with my country and countrymen being manipulated in such a blatant way, and the average citizen who is not part of that ruling class has exactly zero voice in the matter.

"There was this rich old man who hadn't been feeling well. He went to his doctor and the doctor told him that he had an incurable case of cancer. The doctor told him he only had a few weeks left to live. Well, the guy (his name was Fred) was incredibly wealthy; certainly wealthier than Mitt Romney, not quite as wealthy as Donald Trump, and maybe in the same league as Vince McMahon. He went to his accountant to find out about how much he'd have left to provide for his three sons (no, this wasn't Fred MacMurray) and the accountant told him that all his sons would be well taken care of for the rest of their lives.  Fred told his accountant that he also wanted to buy each of his sons a gift that they would always remember him by. Fred called his sons that afternoon and told them to come by the office because he had to talk to each of them individually about something important.  His oldest son, who was 25, entered the room first. Fred told his son that he was dying of cancer and didn't have long to live. He said that the son would be well provided for and would never have to work for a living, but he wanted to buy his son one gift so he would always remember him. The son said he wanted a yacht. Fred called his accountant and told him to call Sam at the yacht harbor and to have him get the biggest and nicest yacht around, and it was his parting gift to his oldest son.  His second son, who was 17, came in next. Fred told him the same story. His son was pretty broken up about it and Fred said that he'd be taken care of, but would like to buy him one frivolous gift so that he'd always remember him by. The second son said he'd like a red Porsche. The father said, ""no problem"", called his accountant and said to call up Joe at the local Porsche dealership and tell him to get the nicest Porsche in the lot, and he wanted it for his son as a gift.  His third son, who was five, was the next in. Fred told him that he was going away soon and that they probably wouldn't be seeing each other for a while. He said things will always be taken care of for him and to remember that his daddy will always love him, even though they won't be seeing each other. He then told his son that before he left, he'd like to buy him a gift and he could have anything he wanted and price would be no object.   The son said he wanted a Mickey Mouse outfit. Fred called his accountant and said, ""Call up Ted and buy him CNN."""

Nah just kidding
"Disclaimer: this does not mean be pro-immigration (we need the wall and daca/chain migration repeal) and sentiment changes as people age/have grandkids causing increased conservative mindset to develop but that might end if we ignore boosting white children/marriages but anyways   I'm not as concerned as most people here about this, since Trump made numerous improvements with Latinos and Reagan managed to get half the Latino vote in California the 80s. We lost the Latino vote there thanks to Proposition 187 and the anti-welfare legislation of the mid 1990s (ie FDR in the 30s after Republicans anti-Slav legislation 1920s). President George W. Bush won a majority among Latino Protestants in 2004 and nearly won the Latino vote but the Democrats sabotaged that effort. Even today nearly 40% of Latinos said they'd vote Jeb! Over Hillary  Hispanics in the West, especially in California, were much stronger for the Democratic Party than in Texas and Florida. California Latinos voted 63–32 for Kerry in 2004, and both Arizona and New Mexico Latinos by a smaller 56–43 margin. Texas Latinos were split nearly evenly, favoring Kerry 50–49 over their favorite son candidate, and Florida Latinos (who are mostly Cuban American) backed Bush, by a 54–45 margin.  In the 2006 midterm election, however, due to the unpopularity of the Iraq War, the heated debate concerning illegal Hispanic immigration, and Republican-related Congressional scandals, Hispanics and Latinos went as strongly Democratic as they have since the Clinton years. Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided 69–30 margin, with Florida Latinos for the first time split evenly.  As a family of Polish and Irish-Immigrants we're naturally inclined to vote for welfare politicians until a certain point (1896-1950s+ until 80s respectfully). That's when we begin to suburbanize, gain 40k income, join military, have Americanized children/grandchildren, protestantifcation, speak English and identify with anti-abortion and anti-tax parties. The Italians, Germans, and Nordic people all went through this transformation in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Polish and Italian Catholics came from recently converted Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called ""nativists. Nativist sentiment experienced a revival amongst families of Polish and Italian immigrants because they saw Latinos as competition for their new achieved status as equal to Anglo-Germanic Americans, that wages go down due to unmitigated immigration and people revolt and vote in a Nixon, Reagan, or Trump. This will happen again amongst Latinos as Asians/Africans begin picking up in immigration  Pooling the 2012 and 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies to obtain large numbers of observations of non-whites and individuals with high incomes, we observe patterns of partisan identity, beliefs about racial prejudice, and attitudes about public policies. Our results suggest that race and class intersect in different ways for different groups in society. Increasing income erodes differences in attitudes between Latinos and whites, but has no effect on the large gap in attitudes between African Americans and whites.  Among all Hispanics, 51% think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, including 20% who think abortion should never be allowed. A survey of adults ages 18 to 35 released Friday by the Public Religion Research Institute found 54 percent of Latino millennials said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. Its just not issue because they haven't achieved status. Healthcare and Food is a bit more important than a 401k or abortions  And they hate Sander's and the new anti-religous socialist Democrat brand (look at primary maps). A primary poll shows that despite recent Clinton controversy 75% of Democrats surveilled feel positively about Hillary Clinton and only 18% of Latinos said they felt positively about Bernie Sanders.   https://decisiondeskhq.com/data-dives/hispanic-heterogeneity-in-the-2016-election/  Hispanics may or may not have swung toward Trump, but they certainly did not give him only 18% of their votes.   Their claim also does not address the following facts: counties in Texas’s heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley almost unanimously swung toward Trump as did rural counties in similarly-proportioned north-central New Mexico. Simulatenously, Hispanic areas of Houston swung strongly to Clinton. This potential urban-rural divide has been noted by some authors, but was rapidly discarded by the Post‘s article as being only on a county-level of analysis. In truth, the urban-rural divide is not the whole story of the Hispanic vote; highly Hispanic precincts in urban areas such as Denver, Albuquerque, San Antonio, Phoenix, and Los Angeles all either swung toward Trump or swung toward Clinton by substantially smaller margins than neighboring majority-white precincts.  A more comprehensive analysis of swings in precincts across the country, both urban and rural, can shed some light on the matter. Here are the average swings between 2012 and 2016 in majority Hispanic precincts across the country based on 2015 ACS census tract demographic data:  Latinos 2012-2016  Another stunning result: ARIZONA Hispanics significantly more supportive of Trump &gt; Romney. 31% of Latinos voted DT, 25% w Romney. Trump won Arizona not because of whites but in spite of them  Truth is Hispanic men won the state for Trump   Democrats gained 3% overall in California's Latinos (Gained 3% Urban, Gained 3.5% Rural)  Democrats lost 12% overall in Colorado's Latinos in 2016 (Lost 11% Urban, Lost 15% Rural)  Democrats lost 7% overall in Connecticut's Latinos in 2016 (Lost 7% both rural and urban)  Democrats gained 4% overall in Florida's Latinos in 2016 (Gained 5% Urban, Lost 9% Rural)   Democrats gained 6.5% overall in Georgia's Latinos in 2016 (Gained 6.5% both rural and urban)  Democrat gained 1% overall in Illinois Latinos in 2016 (Gained 1% Urban, Lost 3.5% Rural)  Democrats remained the same in Kansas, though they gained in Rural areas and lost in urban. Washington remained the same but exact opposite reason why  Democrats lost 4% overall in Nevada's Latinos in 2016 (Lost 4% Urban and Rural)  Democrat lost 7.5% overall in New Jerseys Latinos in 2016 (Lost both rural and urban at 7.5%)  Democrats lost 6.5% overall in New Mexico Latinos in 2016 (Lost 4% Urban, Lost 8% Rural)  Democrats lost 5% overall in New York Latinos in 2016 (Lost 4% Urban, Lost 30% Rural)  Democrats lost 3% overall in Oregon's Latinos in 2016 (Lost 5% Urban, Gained 2% Rural)  Democrats lost 5% overall in Pennsylvania Latinos  Democrats gained 3.5% overall in Texas's Latinos in 2016 (Gained 6% Urban, Lost 4% Rural)  Texas's fits a pattern of minorties in Urban voting Democrat; but we still dominated among Suburban America and even did phenomenally amongst the Latinos in North Richland, Colleyville, Keller, University Park, Irving, and the proxy cities of Plano and Allen.   A lot of areas of Texas had majority Latino districts that voted for Trump by 60-70%. Two reasons  Urban Young Latinos didn't show up like the Democrats wanted (one county in South Texas next to San Antonio that voted Trump but is 70% 25 and under Latino with only 15-20% of those voters showed) which means that these young Latinos have still not been politically activated  Rural and Suburban Latinos in Texas voted more Republican than anyone predicted  Tbh long term the Latinos will be an advantage for Republicans; simply because they fall into the Christan-Conservative category.   While numbers vary by the source, data from the General Social Surveys show that the percentage of Latinos that are Catholic has declined from over 70% to under 50% in the last 15 years, while the number of Latino Protestants has growing from under 15% to 30%. By the 2032 election half of all latinos in America will be protestant  Currently 30% of U.S Latinos self-identify with Protestantism. One-third are Non-Pentecostal Evangelicals, One-third are Pentecostal Evangelicals, One-third are Mainline Protestants. Pentecostal Latinos are by far the fastest growing religion by major population in America and are more religious in all aspects than their White Evangelical counterparts (A group that votes 90-10 for Republicans in 2016 simply because they're the religious party)   Evangelicals and Mainline Protestants Latinos are more likely to have English than Spanish as their primary language, they also had higher income levels and higher education levels than Catholic Latinos. They're also more likely to identify with being American or White  Fusion of Anglo-Latino Protestant Churches are popping up in the U.S because they're more likely to have bilingual pastors than their Catholic counterparts (which the uninhibited rise of immigrants caused typically Democrat White Catholics in the North to vote for Trump simply because they couldn't produce pass language barriers and other factors which can all be explained by a small Minnesota town) and these fusion churches are seen as breaking into Americanism, particularly in the United States East Coast  Latino Protestants and Evangelicals are more likely than White Protestants and Evangelicals to be strongly religious and vote for such parties that represent them. White Catholics and Latino Catholics are 50/50 on about everything  In 2013 90% of U.S born Latinos spoke English Proficiency and that 40% of U.S Citizens Latino households only spoke English. This will matter a great deal in politics as immigration from Latin America has slowed down and thus so will Catholicism growth  To the naysayers who say we shouldn't have any gains with Latinos and stick to just straight whites consider the falling. Several states now have Latino births as the majority; Arizona (45%), California (52%), Nevada (45%), New Mexico (60%), and Texas (50%). Several states are at or above 20% of births being Latino births; Colorado (30%), Connecticut (20%), Florida (25%), Idaho (23%), Illinois (25%), Kansas (20%), Massachusetts (20%), Nebraska (25%), New Jersey (25%), New York (25%), Oregon (20%) Rhode Island (25%), Utah (20%), Washington (20%), Whyoming (20%)    And when this day comes (2040s, 50s, 60s?) It'll change all of American politics. All of America will be a battleground"

So they just allowed bigger monopolies to own even more local tv stations and they removed the rule that you have to keep an actual studio in the local TV station. So now locals stations are just big national repeaters of the monopolies national broadcast with no local input.  They said you can count any High Frequency Ststion UHF as one half of a station meaning one corporation can now own 72 stations and fall below the limit of 31 . Remember modern tvs and cable systems make any UHF station indistinguishable from any other station. This isnt the 1970's when two tuning dials exists on a tv.  Needless to say more monopolization and the loss of local braidcasting news studios in cities is not a good thing.  President Trump will need to step in and discipline the kids. He told them they could stay out till 9pm and they are coming in at 11pm after changing all the clocks in the house..

"Hello fellow Centipedes!    New Jersey ‘Pede checking in.   I usually don’t post I’ve been seen a ton of posts about our legislators and upper-echelon leadership making cucked and terrible decisions and need to get the word out. That motivated me to really being into perspective for some people on what New Jersey is ACTUALLY about. Would love for other Jersey pede’s and pede’s from other cucked states to chime in as well.  There are still plenty of holdouts in New Jersey.  Here is a an interactive map of how every county and every town voted in the 2016 Presidential election.   [Interactive Map (Kek out the unintentionally hilarious election night images.)](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/11/how_your_town_voted_in_the_2016_presidential_election.html)   Most of New Jersey is conservative Irish/Italians/European decent with loyal and respectful family histories and morals (with exceptions to organized crimes.) New Jersey has a rich history of a lot of great and hardworking legal immigrants that entered this county to escape persecution, and great a better life for themselves. We support our first responders (even the lefties for the most part) and try to live in harmony. It’s just the gerrymandered inner cities in the northeast and southwest that push these people into office. If you look at Essex County, we are split down the middle: to the east is the dangerous, urban inner cities ridden with once thriving neighborhoods of a hard working melting pot of immigrants and big families. To the west side is now suburban families and money that originated in the eastern side until crime forced a great immigration out that culminated largely after the 1967 Newark riots. If you look at Western Essex county, you will see there is still stronghold towns holding down and fighting the good fight.   WHAT I ASK is to not judge us all. We try our hardest despite the terrible image and wrap New Jersey gets. Our republicans haven’t done everything correctly and it’s a shame because it was one of the few chances we had to prove something here; but Here’s to hoping. It’s a beautiful state outside of that airport. Come and take a look for yourself. I’m happily located an hour from the shore, and hour from the mountains, 20 minutes from NYC, and an there’s plenty of Forrest and national park. The best view of NYC is from Jersey after all. Don’t just us all. Thanks!  Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, &amp;  Warm Regards,  Streeter17 - Air Force Vet  MAGA.   "

In short, the decision revealed that the 2015 Open Internet Order provides no meaningful net neutrality protections–it allows ISPs to block and throttle content. As the judges who upheld the Order said, “The Order…specifies that an ISP remains ‘free to offer ‘edited’ services’ without becoming subject to the rule’s requirements.” https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2017/05/15/can-isps-simply-opt-out-of-net-neutrality/ But the DC Circuit suggests that a walled garden is fine as long as the provider “mak[es it] sufficiently clear to potential customers that if provides a filtered services involving the ISP’s exercise of ‘editorial intervention.’” Court document here, https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/06F8BFD079A89E13852581130053C3F8/$file/15-1063-1673357.pdf TL;DR: Nothing in previous rules prevented ISPs from throttling or blocking content.

"This is my first time posting in this sub. I've tried to avoid political discussions completely over the past year, but this month has pushed me over the edge.   I don't know how you can respect the Constitution and the justice system, and also conclude that someone is a criminal because a woman makes an accusation with no proof. How do you sleep at night knowing that you're labeling a potentially innocent person as a fucking pedophile or rapist?! What does it take away from the victim if people want proof before someone loses their job, reputation, family, and friends??? How would these people that blindly believe the accusers feel if their dad, husband, brother, or son was wrongly accused of a sex crime, and lost everything because of it???  As a woman, it makes me sick. If someone is going to publicly accuse another person of a crime, there better be a load of good evidence. If there is no evidence, how am I a bad person for not wanting to label someone a rapist when I don't know the truth? How does that take anything away from the alleged victim?   In a thread about Danny Masterson earlier, there were a few people asking if it was fair that he was fired for rape when no criminal charges have been brought against him. People literally rationalized this by saying, ""even if it's not true he only lost his job... it's not like he's going to prison."" What. The. Fuck. He only lost his job? Only? Like, do you not value being employed, and the time and effort and sacrifices that you made to get to where you are? My mind can not comprehend taking every thing away from a person like that with no evidence.  Try to be the voice of reason in another sub or on social media and you're instantly attacked. I can't take it anymore. I'm tired of being quiet.  Hopefully this sub has room for one more"

They are turning natural selection on its head by doing this and giving an unnatural advantage to unfit populations, setting them up for cataclysmic population collapse when they inevitably outstrip our ability or willingness to provide for them.

Former Director Comey’s claims that the FBI “doesn’t give a rip about politics”  - http://archive.is/Wo3ZH#selection-441.41-447.26  Grassley's letter to the DOJ quotes it. Wonder if it was under oath by Comey? 
"https://stonecoldtruth.com/muller-rosenstein-and-comey-the-three-amigos-from-the-deep-state/   From the article:   ""Enter Lisa Barsoomian, wife of Rod Rosenstein.  Lisa is a high-powered attorney in Washington, DC, who specializes in opposing Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of the Deep State, err, I mean, the Intelligence Communities.  Lisa Barsoomian works for R. Craig Lawrence, an attorney who has represented Robert Mueller three times, James Comey five times, Barack Obama forty-five times, Kathleen Sebellius fifty-six times, Bill Clinton forty times, and Hillary Clinton seventeen times between 1991 and 2017.  Barsoomian participated in some of this work personally and has herself represented the FBI at least five separate times.  It would be great to research the specifics of the cases she worked in, many of the documents from the Court Docket relating to these cases have been removed from the D.C. District and Appeals Court, including her representation for Clinton in 1998’s case Hamburg. V. Clinton.  Her loyalties are clearly with the entities that make up the Deep State, as are her husbands.""   Older article, but it is now all beginning to shape up and make more sense. "

"She said something along the lines of, “Its a very controversial decision. But why would Trump do it? Well, guess which group doesn’t like the embassy move? Muslims.” She literally spinned a political move that the past few administrations had promised to do and made it into an Anti-Muslim move made by the racist Islamophobic Nazi Drumpf. Newsflash: it’s not an anti-Muslim move. It’s a pro-Israel move."

Would it be possible to track the number of people in the physical location of people in the polling area by their cell phones? Cells have gps tracking and the cell towers collect the location of individual cells. Without identifying the individuals identity you can track who was at the polling place. Then match the number of people that actually cast votes compared to the number that were in a physical voting place.  Sample enough districts to see if something is not accurate.  92% turn out?

"&gt;Here's what the bill contains, according to a Republican summary:  &gt;* The proposal would maintain seven individual income tax brackets at slightly different rates: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 37 percent. The top rate would fall from the current 39.6 percent. The House originally proposed collapsing the system to four brackets, saying it would simplify the filing process.  &gt;* The bill would scrap the personal exemption but increase the standard deduction to slightly less than double its current level. It would go to $12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for a family.  &gt;* It would drop the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from the current 35 percent. The change would take effect next year.  &gt;* The plan would set a 20 percent business income deduction for the first $315,000 in income earned by pass-through businesses.  &gt;* The bill would scrap Obamacare's provision that requires most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. Doing so is projected to lead to 13 million fewer people with insurance and raise average Obamacare premiums, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.  &gt;* The plan would eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax, which the Senate added back to its plan at the last second to raise money. House leaders and corporate groups said the tax would stifle research and development.  &gt;* The estate tax, or so-called death tax, would remain but the exemption from it would be doubled.  &gt;* The child tax credit would double to $2,000 per child from $1,000. It would be refundable up to $1,400 and start to phase out at $400,000 in income.  &gt;* The plan would limit state and local tax deductions. It would allow the deduction of up to $10,000 in state and local sales, income or property taxes.  &gt;* It will not change the mortgage interest deduction for existing homeowners. For new homes, taxpayers can deduct interest on up to $750,000 in mortgage debt.  https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/gop-releases-its-final-tax-plan--heres-whats-in-it.html  https://archive.is/tWXRA"
"The GDP is at 4%. Prior to Trump taking office, the best economists CNN could find said this was a virtual impossibility. It's now a matter of historical record that they were wrong yet again. So much for 'experts.'  They also said that manufacturing jobs were not coming back. Well, they came back and continue to come back. Unemployment is at a 17 year low and the economy is booming.  They said the stock market would collapse when Trump took office. It has consistently broken its own records. Obama's stock market also rose, however that was from printing trillions of debt based dollars out of thin air to bail out Wall Street and ""too big to fail"" financial entities. Thus, Obama doubled the national debt in 8 years and the GDP stagnated at 1.5% in his final year.  Cryptocurrencies like BitCoin, Ether and others are now taking off because they present alternatives to privately run central banks that produce a debt based fiat currency, backed by nothing, which is then loaned into existence, with interest, to the governments and people that utilize it.  As such, these private central banks have become more powerful than the governments they finance. These banking interests have also funded both sides of every modern war. Without this funding, and some might say intentional planning and instigation, these wars never could have happened. The costs in human lives have been immense.  It's therefore understandable, given the water under the bridge to date, that people would have a blanket distrust for all things government and lump Trump in with the rest of the clowns in the car.  But to those paying attention, it should be understood that we are in the early phases of a massive Reformation in the world of politics, currency, intelligence organizations, and the media.  What once could be kept in the dark, under a 'rule by secrecy,' is no longer possible. It's said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Well, if you thought 2017 was interesting, regardless of what side of the political fence you were on, you ain't seen nothing yet. Invest in disinfectant.  The white hats have always existed within intelligence, military and business circles, but they never had the tide of history backing and propelling them. Now we will see what happens when information can no longer be hidden. We will see the just rule of Law return to the land, along with an implementation of an economic system designed to thrive, instead of one intentionally hamstrung by elites to line their own pockets and maintain their control.  Some may think that President Donald Trump is simply out to enrich himself and others in his club and that the moves his administration makes do not benefit the average citizen. This is a point of view that is pushed 24/7 by certain well entrenched factions of the mainstream media, a media which is owned by giant international corporations in bed with the central banks. They take direction from what you might call rogue elements within organizations such as the CIA.  A previous President made noise about these exact things (secret societies, the CIA and the FED). His name was John F. Kennedy. We know what happened to him. Trump has a different destiny, however, as this is an entirely different era.  It turns out the Swamp does not appreciate being drained. Because in the draining, the power and control said Swamp offers is thusly drained. The gig is up and many will have to answer to the music. And a sweet music it is not. Many 'important figures' will go to jail, for everything from money laundering, to treason, and in some cases, much worse than this, when the child trafficking crimes of the higher ups come into the glare of public light. There have been over 6,000 pedophile and child trafficking arrests since Trump and his team took office. This has been the dirty secret in Washington and Hollywood, and frankly all over the world, for far too long to fathom with an open heart.  Does anyone seriously think the broad scale corruption that is being revealed would have taken place if Hillary Clinton, whose entire career is an epic poem to corruption, had moved back into the White House? Alongside, of course, the other half of the political hydra that is her 'husband' Bill Clinton. They of the beneficent Clinton Foundation, kindest of all money laundering charities. It takes a village. And they took many.  A lot of career politicians have gotten filthy rich off government jobs whose salaries do not reflect the windfall they came into after taking office. Where did all of this loot come from? Did they get rich gambling in Vegas like our latest 'lone gunman'? Methinks not. It's called Pay to Play and the Clintons were masters of it. Unfortunately for them, money tends to leave a trail, no matter how much they'd like to wash it away. BleachBit, anyone? It doesn't take a genius to see that, under a Clinton admin, it would have been business as usual. The scandals would have been fastidiously swept under the rug by professional fixers like James Comey, formerly of the FBI. And the mega corporate lobbyists would have continued to run their pay for play game in tandem with the politicos. And, of course, terror factions like ISIS would have flourished. After all, the agents that funded them behind the scenes would still be in power.  Nowadays, ISIS is in a total collapse. They've lost all of their Middle East strongholds, because now they are actually being fought in a manner designed to defeat them. All they have left are their sleeper cells, which wreak havoc in several of the poorly governed countries of Europe - countries which struggle to properly run their own systems, because they answer to the globalist bureaucrats of the EU and not their own citizens. But this, too, will change. There is a groundswell in many of these places for their own version of Donald Trump, a populist leader with the fortitude and wherewithal to return the power to the people, where it belongs.  Fortunately, in the United States, we already have our Donald Trump. And we have this leadership now because, on a greater level than many realize, we actually willed this into being. The long Era of Secrecy and Control is being dismantled at its very cornerstones. In doing so, new cornerstones will be put into place, ones with a foundation built on integrity, freedom, and the best interests of all of the people at heart. No longer will the government be a front operation for those maneuvering in the shadows.  Is Trump some perfectly realized being? Absolutely not. He is as fallible as any of us. But his word is his bond. He is as dedicated as any leader in the world to fulfilling the promises he campaigned on. You may hold onto the notion that Trump is out to take healthcare away from you or enrich some rich crony capitalists, but this is not the case. The MAGA movement is sincere at its heart, which is what provides its great strength, its momentum and eventually, its longevity. Remember, Trump is not owned by lobbyists, unlike his political opponents. He financed his own campaign and was beholden to no outside moneyed interests. He can't be bought, in other words. How many other politicians can say that?  In fact, only someone with Donald J. Trump's precise set of skills and life circumstances could have pulled the sword from the stone and entered the dragon's lair to defeat such an immensely well organized and well funded beast that was the entrenched political system.  Some very well-intentioned people thought Bernie Sanders could have been that man. And indeed, the populist candidate Bernie did collect money from the people of the village and ride off on his donkey to the dragon's fiery den. But he stopped just short of the cave, feeling the heat of what he was up against. He then returned with singed clothes to the village and endorsed the dragon! No refunds y'all. He ran on fighting a 'rigged system' and then he bowed to that very same rigging, even when it was against his own campaign.  Socialism never works, by the way. Its chief aim is to centralize power in a vast bureaucratic government, where the citizens are 'equalized' but disempowered vis-a-vis the all-powerful State. It leads to a totalitarian regime in the end and a general poverty is its bellwether. See every time it has ever been implemented, and Venezuela for some recent results. It is effective in small doses only, under a system driven by free markets in which the best ideas compete for implementation and individuals are encouraged to innovate and grow within that system.  So, we find ourselves here. At the first act of an entirely new play. There is great promise ahead, though times may appear dark. In actuality, it is the greatly increasing light that is revealing what has ever been there and thriving in the shadows.  One of those things is 'dark money.' As the link below addresses, there have been untold trillions spent on unaccounted for programs that did nothing whatsoever to improve the lives of the people of the world. That money went to the plans and back-up plans of players whose interests ran counter to the interests of humanity. When this spending is cut off at the roots and returned in a productive way to the eco-system of American life, there will be a new renaissance that all of the people will participate in. The purge in Saudi Arabia is a bellwether of what will happen in the US, however, it will be done within the modus operandi of the US Justice System.  http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/msu-scholars-find-21-trillion-in-unauthorized-government-spending-defense-department-to-conduct/  The plans are long and the plans are broad, and like all great plans they may take longer then expected to accomplish from our perspective. But from another perspective, they are happening at the speed of light.  You can expect the Reformation to pick up speed in 2018. Hollywood and Washington, kissing cousins that they are, will continue to air out their dirty laundry so that it can be cleaned and replaced with something with far better thread counts.  Trump will continue to represent what I have always underlined: Building &amp; Prosperity and Law &amp; Order. Neither of these dual concepts are racist, sexist or xenophobic. A great leader both protects and enriches the people of his land. When those those interests are in order, he or she can extend the horizons beyond their own borders to the world at large.  Trump may indeed be one of the biggest fans of Trump, but he arrived at a time when he was truly essential. He answered the call at a remarkable crossroads of History, and now we are on a new timeline where all things are possible.  We will see a reformation of our economic system.  We will see a reformation of our intelligence organizations.  We will see a reformation of our local and federal government, all the way from the election process to term limits and above all else, to personal accountability.  We will see a massive reformation of Big Pharma, an industry whose pockets have been lined by keeping people sick, and in some cases, actually engineering illnesses, rather than healing them. This will have a significant carry over effect in the Medical community at large.  And lastly, we will see a gigantic growth in new energy technologies, as the free market is unchained from the fetters of multinational conglomerates that buy out patents and stifle the emergence of the inventions that can compete with them. We will see a comeback of the original Tesla, and not a company that simply hijacked his name.  Take, if you will, a step away from the media culture that has a vested interest in the old world order, and consider for a moment what a truly free humanity might be capable of. The World Wars of yesteryear required an insane amount of money and human resources. When the financial instigators of those wars are removed from power, we will see humanity emerge into a remarkably positive new dawn.  Trump is part of it, but he is only one man. The movement is much bigger than him and it has only just begun. It cannot be stopped or derailed, it can only be momentarily slowed down. But make no mistake, it is going in the direction that Life itself has decreed. #MAGA "

"The FBI’s Trump ‘Insurance’  More troubling evidence of election meddling at the bureau.  The Editorial Board  WALL STREET JOURNAL Dec. 13, 2017 7:22 p.m. ET   Democrats and the media are accusing anyone who criticizes special counsel Robert Mueller as Trumpian conspirators trying to undermine his probe. But who needs critics when Mr. Mueller’s team is doing so much to undermine its own credibility?  Wednesday’s revelations—they’re coming almost daily—include the Justice Department’s release of 2016 text messages to and from Peter Strzok, the FBI counterintelligence agent whom Mr. Mueller demoted this summer. The texts, which he exchanged with senior FBI lawyer Lisa Page, contain expletive-laced tirades against Mr. Trump. Such Trump hatred is no surprise and not by itself disqualifying. More troubling are texts that suggest that some FBI officials may have gone beyond antipathy to anti-Trump plotting.  “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office—that there’s no way [Trump] gets elected—but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” Mr. Strzok wrote Ms. Page in an Aug. 15, 2016 text. He added: “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”  What “policy” would that be? The “Andy” in question is Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director. FBI officials are allowed to have political opinions, but what kind of action were they discussing that would amount to anti-Trump “insurance”?  In another exchange that month, Ms. Page forwarded a Trump-related article and wrote: “Maybe you’re meant to stay where you are because you’re meant to protect the country from that menace.” He thanked her and assured: “Of course I’ll try and approach it that way.” Mr. Strzok, recall, is the man who changed the words “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless” in James Comey’s July 2016 public exoneration of Hillary Clinton’s emails.  The McCabe meeting came on the heels of the FBI’s launch of its counterintelligence probe into Trump-Russia ties. July is also when former British spook Christopher Steele briefed the FBI on his Clinton-financed dossier of salacious allegations against Mr. Trump. The texts explain why Mr. Mueller would remove Mr. Strzok, though a straight shooter wouldn’t typically resist turning those messages over to Congress for as long as Mr. Mueller did.  Meanwhile, we’re learning more about the political motives of Mr. Mueller’s lieutenant, Andrew Weissmann. Judicial Watch last week released an email in which Mr. Weissmann expressed his “awe” and praise for Sally Yates, after the then acting AG and Obama holdover refused to implement Mr. Trump’s travel ban.  This should trouble anyone who cares about the integrity of the Justice Department. Ms. Yates had every right to resign at the time if she felt she couldn’t implement Mr. Trump’s order. But she had no authority as an executive branch official to defy a legitimate presidential order. Mr. Weissmann’s support for her insubordination was a declaration that he is part of the “resistance.” This should be unacceptable in a ranking FBI official, much less someone charged with conducting a fair-minded investigation.  Public confidence isn’t helped by the continuing Justice and FBI refusal to cooperate with Congress. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mr. Mueller, toed the Mueller-FBI line on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee. He repeated FBI Director Christopher Wray’s preposterous excuse that he can’t answer questions because of an Inspector General probe. And he wouldn’t elaborate on the news that Nellie Ohr, the wife of senior Justice official Bruce Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS, which hired Mr. Steele to gin up his dossier.  The man who should be most disturbed by all this is Mr. Mueller, who wants his evidence and conclusions to be credible with the public. Evidence is building instead that some officials at the FBI—who have worked for him—may have interfered in an American presidential election. Congress needs to insist on its rights as a co-equal branch of government to discover the truth.  Appeared in the December 14, 2017, print edition."

"What if Trump knows all the bad shit done by Obama/Comey but believes its too bad for the country to go through a huge upheaval and he just wants to get on with MAGA, and he decides that he needs Mueller not to bring them all down but to investigate everything - understand the depths and total players then the Russia investigation is ended clearing him as he knew it would then he overhauls the DOJ and FBI without openly admitting they are both corrupt over his first term."

I don't think GEOTUS is that dumb. Anybody else getting the idea that the dems commissioned these posts to weaken GEOTUS's decision?
He is doing such a poor job that we arent sure if he is secretly working for Trump and not against. When this ends in 12 years we will look back and be grateful either way.   Fwiw- my 2 cents is that the fbi is fully incapable of being a viable entity anymore and is still ran by people formerly in office not currently. 
Fuck Fake News 
Enjoy it folks ! You have the best president !

Though they apparently laid off 600 workers right after. I read into it because I was disappointed, it seems like they are going to move them to different departments if they can. Since the workers they laid off were in areas where their departments were in decline, while in other places increasing. They plan to hire in MO for example 1000 workers (around there), since they see an increase. So idk if it's laid off, or if they are going to move them to different departments to work. It seems like they were talking like that, but only time will tell.   **Fifth Third Bancorp** - $1000 bonuses to 13,500 employees and set a $15 minimum wage.  **Wells Fargo** - Raised minimum wage from $13.50 to $15.   **Boeing** - Investing additional $300 million for job-training, facility upgrades, and charitable giving in the next year.   **Washington Federal** - 5% merit increase to all employees earning less than $100,000 annually, and will be investing in employee training and technology upgrades (they didn't say how much yet).

"I remember someone saying ""South Park is a litmus test for people who get triggered easily."" That's true. I agree with that. In fact, I'll even go out on a limb and laugh at a joke about Trump just as long as it's funny and is an actual joke. That being said, almost every single episode in Season 21 takes a jab at Trump and most of the time it has nothing to do with the rest of the episode and isn't even funny. It's a political statement in a tv comedy show that pretends to be funny.   By my counts, there were 4 episodes in Season 21 regarding Trump and most of them have him looking like an idiot. Again, they don't even try to be jokes. They are lame political statements. By comparison, at least the episodes involving Obama and THEY EVEN had a story. Overall I counted 4 episodes regarding Obama (1 in season 12, 1 in 14, 1 in 15, and 1 in 16). Compare those 4 episodes spread out across 4 seasons to 4 episodes about Trump JUST IN ONE SEASON.  Fuck your bullshit Matt Stone and Trey Parker. "

The rooms, decorated by our First Lady with care, In hopes that GEPOTUS soon would be there. Americans so happy all safe in their beds, With the border wall growing like the dreams in their heads. My Mom in pajamas and Dad with MAGA cap, Had just settled in for a nice little nap. Then right on the TV there arose such a clatter, Dad jumped from his chair to see what was the matter! He grabbed the remote and turned up the sound, Our great President was on with something about to go down! He was dressed in his suit, and classic red tie. My Mom took a look and I heard a happy sigh. It appears an announcement was reaching my ear, Our President saying we had no more to fear. The tax bill was passed by the House and the Senate and each one of them read it, to see what was in it! Then... He took down the Clintons, the Podestas, and George Soros, All the traitors, the fake news and scary tomorrows. With the help of the pedes, and the memes they create, He said now good-bye to the evil deep State. He thanked all of Reddit especially Pepe, the autists the chans the whole group got covfefe. Lets MAGA together and from this night forward, We say 'Merry Christmas' And Win...until we are too tired to win any more! So much winning! Merry Christmas Everyone!

"Anyone interested in creating a calculator/website which will calculate the money that people save, so that they can then send it to the Treasury as an extra payment?   I want something to send to all of the hypocritical leftists on FaceBook and Twitter. This money also goes straight to paying off the national debt, so it’s a win-win: shitposting and maybe actually getting leftists to pay more money��. So anytime they criticize Trump throughout 2018, I can ask if they’ve sent their extra payments yet and ask for screenshots of the transaction.  Should be easy to create.

"I've got a shop teacher who's in general laid back and easy going, but he flat out said that he has zero tolerance for racism, bigotry, sexism, etcetera whilst he spoke in front of everybody earlier this week. Sure, easy enough - It was little more than him trying to ensure everyone is on the level, but it ended up proving to me that those who speak out the most about racism seem to be the most racist, or prone to viewing things in terms of colour.      We have one person in the class who's of some sort of Muslim descent, based on his looks and his name. I knew him from before, having chatted with him at work from time to time, and never paid it any attention. Our teacher spoke by describing our nearly entirely white class (sans this one particular student) by saying that we're ""A homogeneous  group"" and then giving a little spiel on how he opposes the aforementioned *isms*. I'd never, until he started speaking in terms of skin colour, noticed that we even had somebody who wasn't the same colour. I say this with complete honesty - while I'd recognized that this individual was obviously from a different corner of the globe, it was never something I thought of beyond a simple visual observation. When I would look at him, his features were something that I attributed to him - that I recognized him by, like I would attribute features to anybody else.       Skin colour meant nothing to me aside from being one of these characteristics (and I sure as hell never considered his, let alone anyone elses worth based on something so insignificant - I'm all about merit, and expect to be judged the same), and it wasn't until my teacher emphasized these differences that I really considered it in any serious light. Simply put, I didn't care about his skin colour until somebody started very clearly implying that us ""white"" folks shouldn't make anybody feel bad for not being white.      Now, to break down my thoughts a little further - the whole angle my teacher took is that whites (especially men) are the only ones capable of racism, and that these poor 'others' are victims who will never feel comfortable with who they are unless we make sure to never upset them, no matter what. The entire ""racism"" angle in out culture is strictly focused around the dealings of the big, bad whites versus anybody else. Beyond the implications that only whites can be racist/sexist/bigoted towards others, we need to address how anybody can look at the world in such as way as to focus strictly on such superficial characteristics - and then preach to others about doing the ""right"" thing as if it's not condescending towards their targets, and patronizing to the supposed victims. I reject this notion entirely on the grounds that I, personally, had never looked at my classmate in terms of colour and refuse to accept the implication that I'm going to be racist because of MY skin colour and MY gender. Everything he sought to speak out against, was strictly towards white men, and the point was completely lost. Hell, you could tell that the singled out individual was uncomfortable, whereas 30 seconds prior he was just another classmate to us - and he damn well should be considered as such. Fuck this hypocritical rhetoric - tell offended soyboys and crybabies that they ought to learn to take a joke.      (I really like the Dave Chappelle skit, Clayton Bigsby, the black, white supremacist. I'd hope that everybody can laugh at the irony, and laugh at people who make a big deal about us laughing about...well, just about anything *[I know I'll offend at least one snowflake by saying I enjoy this skit]* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFJAAMS8U5Y )"

"--- **Intro and Motivation**  Given what we know now in late Dec, 2017, the continuance of the obvious witch hunt of Mueller's ""Special Council"" is now causing harm to the American people, because it's sending a signal to our culture and to our legal system that *""presumption of innocence""* doesn't matter--it is false.  Because if a group can do this to the highest position in america--the President of the United States--they can certainly do this same thing to you: ***lawfare***.  Dragging out a legal matter, well beyond its intended scope and time frame, causing grievous harm to taxpayers who have to shoulder the burden of the same, while also insulting and accusing not just the lawfully-elected President but all of those who voted for him.  In a way, this accusation of election meddling with no evidence to support it--with plenty of evidence to disprove the same--is an attempt not only to reverse a disfavorable political decision by the oppositional team,  ...the continuance of the special council in light of the many legal, political conflicts-of-interest of the Special Council team members, and the failure of the MSM or Council to consider counter-evidence that undeniably creates sufficient doubt to stop the investigation, are simply ways to insult, humiliate and infuriate half the country, by assaulting their presumption of innocence, with what could be considered a discriminatory, political assault, whose unreasonable extension can be considered malice, stalking, lawfare, libel, slander, and conspiracy.  Is it possible for Mueller's Team to be sued in a class-action lawsuit for assaulting and degrading *common law, specifically the Presumption of Innocence*, or if not, for essentially waging psychological, nonlinear warfare against the American public?  Are there any legal scholars out there know the answer to this question?  This lawsuit would not be intended to ""stop an investigation"" because it will likely stop itself from having no evidence.  This lawsuit would occur after the investigation, as payback for the assault on our way of life.  It would be payback for dragging this thing--and the american people--through the mud for over a year.  You don't get to do that without accepting the consequences of your action.    Someone once said, I think it was John Taylor Gatto: ""Lawsuits are how assholes communicate to each other"", and trust me on this, Mueller needs a stiff talking-to.  --- **Presumption of Innocence**  From the Wikipedia article on the [Presumption of innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence)  &gt; Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments.  The case of [Coffin v. United States (1895)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_v._United_States) established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes.  See also [In Re Winship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_re_Winship)  In re Winship is described as follows:  &gt; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that ""the Due Process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.""[1]:17 It established this burden in all cases in all states (constitutional case).[1]:17 The decision did not specify which facts constitute the charged crime  ...and Coffin v. United States is elaborated thusly:  &gt; The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law ... Concluding, then, that the presumption of innocence is evidence in favor of the accused, introduced by the law in his behalf, let us consider what is 'reasonable doubt.' It is, of necessity, the condition of mind produced by the proof resulting from the evidence in the cause. It is the result of the proof, not the proof itself, whereas the presumption of innocence is one of the instruments of proof, going to bring about the proof from which reasonable doubt arises; thus one is a cause, the other an effect. To say that the one is the equivalent of the other is therefore to say that legal evidence can be excluded from the jury, and that such exclusion may be cured by instructing them correctly in regard to the method by which they are required to reach their conclusion upon the proof actually before them; in other words, that the exclusion of an important element of proof can be justified by correctly instructing as to the proof admitted. The evolution of the principle of the presumption of innocence, and its resultant, the doctrine of reasonable doubt, make more apparent the correctness of these views, and indicate the necessity of enforcing the one in order that the other may continue to exist.

Those mostly psychopathic pagan actors that are running our government at the highest levels have 'strange bedfellows' including a 40 foot owl and crossdressing/naked orgies in the woods of norther california, or whatever.  So I'm going to put this into a language that they uniquely understand.  Assuming Mueller isn't some kind of double agent hired by Trump (5D chess is very unlikely), Mueller's team and those he represents have broken natural law.  This means that everything they've done will whiplash back at them times 3, by way of the very mechanisms of their initial assualt.  Tick Tock.  Karma Clock.  It's a bitch, they say."

When all seemed bad, subs like The_Donald were there to lighten my day. The interesting and clever article titles and the engaging discussions in the comments just brought a lighter side to the frankly accusatory headlines being pumped out by the MSM. Although not as big here in AUS as it is in the US, the disenfranchised right wing is growing and this makes me optimistic about the future of my great country. As always MAAGA (Make America and Australia Great Again)."

"I think it smacks of fear when people try to prevent others' ideas from being heard by calling those ideas ""hate speech.""  If the ideas are truly absurd, wouldn't it be better to just soundly refute them and allow people to self censor what they read and listen to?  There is no reason to ""SHUT DOWN hate speech.""  When people seem desperate to do so, it makes me believe they know there's truth in what's being said and are just using ""hate speech"" as a boogy man... trying to avoid facing any cognitive dissonance, as well as scare others from listening to the idea.  ""Hate crime"" is another completely unnecessary term.  A crime is a crime.  Classifying some as ""hateful"" and others not just creates a hierarchy of victimhood.  It anything, a hate crime should be determined solely as the ACTION of the crime, not the people involved.  It is action that determines hate.  Any other approach pretends that one victim's pain is less than another's."

Now let's deregulate the laws that say only surgeons trained one way are allowed to perform surgery and everyone else is jailed. Lets really deregulate healthcare and not continue to let the providers make the regulations. In 6 months you'll have cnc machines performing surgery for $1000 with sub millimeter accuracy. And while at it lets deregulate pharma drugs and have all treatments mandate a efficacy report in a public databsse and in 6 months youll have the best treatments for $100 or for free with far less side effects. After all we dont owe the medical establishment  a damn protected outrageous living

He has exposed Washington Post and now Soros has targeted him!! God bless him!! Go thank him today for all he's done!!
"negotiating with the Senate, he's got the votes!"
"Hello ladies and gentleman.  This LNC is taking a slightly different tone.  The last few Thursdays were reserved for making poetry great again, and dance parties.  But to be frank, I am livid.  Today we watched the corruption of justice, and the degradation of common sense.  ______  This evening, a jury in San Francisco found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate innocent of first and second degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and assault with a semi-automatic weapon in the killing of Kate Steinle.  For those of you who did not know, this was the case that created the push for ""Kate's Law,"" and helped to spark the debate of sanctuary cities and states.  We have officially witnessed the death of an impartial justice system.  One's race, and legal status matters more than common sense.  Progressivism and leftism have infected our societies and justice system to such a degree, that a man that had been deported 5 times previously, who was in possession of a stolen firearm (That was taken a few nights before from a BLM officer) and fired the weapon in the city resulting in the loss of life is able to walk free.  The sole reason? He is an illegal.  Had this man been white, he would have been convicted immediately (and rightfully so)  Had person been black, he would have been convicted (and rightfully so).  You see, justice should be color blind.  Right or wrong is not based on a spectrum of one's skin color, or legal status.  It is based on breaking the law.  Correct me if I am wrong, but killing someone is generally breaking the law unless in self-defense....  California has intentionally created a system where good hardworking citizens can barely afford rent, raise kids and feed their families (Trust me, I know).  Meanwhile, they are taxed at some of the highest tax rates in the US.  Do you guys remember when the Oroville dam nearly crumbled, threatening upwards of 200,000 homes?  I do...  Why wasn't the dam repaired with all that tax money they take from us?  It has become extremely evident that California has prioritized the financial support of illegals and the welfare state, over the safety and maintenance of its infrastructure and financial well-being in general.    *BUT WHY /U/KATFISH29?  WHY WOULD CALIFORNIA DO THAT?*  The answer is surprisingly simple.  Creating an entire voter class that is completely reliant on the government to survive (or stay in the country for that matter) is the easiest way to ensure the power structure remains in place.  If the sanctuary city and illegal immigration was cut off and or deported, the leftist platform would slowly wither and die due to millions of its supporters no longer being available to vote.  Oh and If you didn't know, illegals can get drivers licenses in the state of California..  Makes you think...  ____  To the family and friends of Kate Steinle I say this:  You are in my thoughts and prayers.  I promise that the death of your daughter, sister and or friend will not be in vain.  This community will always fight for the rights of our fellow American citizens.  We will fight for what is right, and not what is easy.  I vow to you that this will not be the end.  Globalists beware, America has awoken and we will win.  God bless."
"My wife used to work for this company in Salt Lake that employees a dozen or so illegals. The kicker, all of them are on some sort of welfare, and their kids are on medicaid. When my wife worked there, she was living paycheck to paycheck, barely getting by, and she could not qualify for any kind of welfare, nor could her daughter get medicaid. So she went without health insurance and any kind of assistance for years. All the while these assholes who have no right to be here are getting all the fucking help they needed.   I've wanted to do this for a while, but decided not to, but after what happened with Kate Steinle, fuck it, I'm over this. Build the fucking wall, deport the fuckers!"
Stand strong
" When we walk away from the storm’s roar Then I will be afraid no more And now I’m sure of where I stand Let the strength of peace run through this land  Big Country, way ahead of their time.  https://youtu.be/TV2YmjFCHJg  Spez: I think a lot of the songs they put out are relevant in today's environment.  And their management was cool with their music being used on radio shows like Alex Jones."
I might be wrong but im getting the same feeling i got days prior to the election. I dont know exaclty whats going on but it feels like there is a category 5 hurricane of shot about to be dumped onto the left. I feelblike while everyone is waiting for some big happening Trump is chipping awaybat the deep state. Maybe im wrong and its just his power and total lack of cuckedness but it feels like hes setting all the pieces up for something great.
Gnome sayin?
"The wall must be built. It will be such a small investment compared to what it saves the country not only in money, but in lives.   Don't forget the big, beautiful door for LEGAL entry!"
"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/sample_ballots_marked_for_doug.html  Premarked ballets found in one district office and destroyed. All parties involved found it to be weird they even existed. They did not look into other districts. SHAME  They were giving absentee ballets to felony prisoners still in prison! WTF! https://youtu.be/Hhq8jI35R4M Another source https://libertyunyielding.com/2017/11/30/dems-register-thousands-alabama-felons-vote-last-minute-push/  https://www.roymoore.org/Press-Releases/141/Moore-Campaign-Calls-on-Secretary-of-State-to-Investigate-Voter-Fraud  Election officials said the ballots have been discarded. That was literally it. ""Take our word for it, move along now"" Compare that to the letter that Roy Moore's campaign wrote where he sought further validation to make sure that fuckery wasn't afoot. here's what the Moore campaign wanted:   &gt;First, please request the Probate Judges across Alabama to inspect the election materials currently in their possession—including but not limited to official sample ballots—for signs of tampering or other mischief.

"First, let's summarize **the concept** of net neutrality (not the 400 page Obama regulation that is falsely called this (and obviously none of its supporters read)):  &gt; The idea that all content on the Internet should be treated equally and without consideration for corporate or political favoritism.  Do you remember what the Internet was like before 2015? It'll be like that without this regulation, but with a catch; Google will *still* be able to manipulate its search results and ban apps like Gab.ai, YouTube will *continue* the mass demonetizion of videos, Twitter and Facebook will *continue* banning political dissidents, and monopolistic social media companies in general will *continue* censoring and abusing their customers (and selling their personal data, and also use that data to build advanced artificial intelligence).  The Obama regulation falsely called ""Net Neutrality"" did not regulate edge providers (e.g. social media companies) under Title II, which is why as we approach 2018, roughly 3 years after the regulation was passed, **the net is the least neutral it's ever been in the history of the Internet.**  Broadband providers like Comcast were already essentially (just not officially) regulated under Title II restrictions in terms of individual protection. What the FCC did was declare that Internet service providers (broadband providers) with &gt;100,000 customers should be regulated differently than large corporations who provide services on the Internet (edge providers). Remember, we're talking about Internet-centered corporations that serve and deal with big data for a large number of people.  In doing so, Obama's FCC favored one type of corporation over another, increasing the profits of edge providers like Netflix, and more importantly having **no effect** on monopolistic broadband provider profits, who offset losses on necessary infrastructure investments by increasing your Internet bill (and you likely don't have another provider to choose from).  Anybody who claims that, after the repeal of this regulation, ISPs will be able to charge you extra for accessing certain sites, throttle or block specific content, or engage in any other kind of abuse that was not possible before 2015, is outright lying, completely stupid, or both.  If anything, the repeal of the Obama regulation will spur a new discussion about regulating massive companies collecting your data and abusing their customers, which is why Google is so against the repeal.  The outrage about a reduction in Internet freedom was **purposely** misdirected solely at broadband providers by the Obama administration. Everything Obama did was to benefit coporations and special interest e.g. the ""Afforadable Care Act"" gave monopolies to insurance companies by preventing insurance companies from competing across state lines, while forcing individuals to pay for health insurance, or face a penalty that is thousands of dollars, increasing each successive year.  That is why Ajit Pai is justifiably trying to repeal the Obama regulation that, again, is falsely called ""Net Neutrality""."

Reminder that during the transition period after the election the Trump administration was desperately trying to unwind the move towards World War 3 that Hillary had initiated with Russia. And that is one of the things Trump was elected to do. He saved us.  Example : July 2016 putin begs media to wake up and recognize the danger that Hillarycs state department personll were putting the world in by stationing missiles on Russias border and issuing threats.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ar5p-tV8cQ&amp;feature=youtu.be  Example her state department was literally threatening putin personally  .

"Peel away all the hype, all the over excited pundits, even the Fox News doomsayers (who are in bed with the country club club Republicans), and what do we really have here with Flynn?  Nothing  He lied to the FBI (and Pence) about his phone calls to ambassador Kislyak, for which Trump fired him last February, and for which the FBI will give him a slap on the rest.  But he is going to testify that Jared and possibly even Trump told him to call Russia??  It doesn’t matter.  The White House just said they were authorized to make the call, by none other than Obama.  What about those other charges that added up to 50 or 60 years in jail? He must’ve traded some pretty devastating information about Trump in order to get his deal reduced, huh?  Well, how about planning to kidnap a Turkish foreign national hiding in the US and return him to Erdogan for $15 million.  Intent to kidnap is a pretty scary charge, even if they can’t make it stick.    You see, Flynn worked for trump for about 24 days, however he worked for Obama in defense intelligence for 733 days.  Plenty of time in the swamp to acquire skeletons in his closet.  So what does Mueller have?    -Papadopoulos who offered Russian collusion, and trumps team refused it.  - Manafort &amp; Gates, unrelated charges from many years previous, nothing to do with Trump  - Flynn lied to the FBI, but nothing to do with collusion.  Talked to Russia and quite a few other countries about a UN vote -ultimately trying to help the United States by calming down the UN.   But there is a deep state problem brewing. If there is no Russian collusion the only justification for unmasking Trump’s team goes back to the fake Russian dossier and then they have a Watergate sized scandal of an acting president (Obama) unmasking the opposition party’s candidate (Trump team).  There is a theory brewing on pol that Mueller is actually secretly prosecuting the deep state. That would be nice, but given how he came into this position, through Comey manipulating the system, I doubt it.  Look at all of the Hillary supporters he stocked his team with. Swampy.   I think Mueller is in terminate mode, but frustrated because ultimately he is going after an innocent man, Trump.   So rather than walk away empty-handed, Mueller is going to shakedown anyone he can, make as much noise as he can and at least cover for the Deep State’s illegal unmasking, authorized by Obama."

THANK YOU for sincerely giving a shit about hard--working, tax-paying, honest, legal, AMERICAN citizens.  WE LOVE YOU!!!"
"So we all must acknowledge and understand why this tax cut is a good thing for ALL Americans. We are led to believe that this is something that doesn’t benefit the middle class. Which we all know is who really supports this country monetarily with all the taxes we pay year after year. The Congress is responsible for maintaining and setting forth a budget. It then passes this tax budget and policies to the Senate, who must then approve these items. It can make amendments and pass it back to the House where they reconcile the differences in both bills, so that ultimately one passes. Then it goes to the resolute desk to be signed. Now remember that we pay for these budgets. It all comes out of our pockets. And let’s be honest for one second here, our government (and may of us that have worked for government understand this especially well) is a whole lot less than efficient. They spend too much and do too little. Then sometimes they spend it on ridiculous things that we don’t benefit from. So, there’s some that think perhaps the government shouldn’t have so much to spend, that way they are forced to really justify programs, and hopefully on some truly worthy causes. We all want that. We want our government to work for us, not the other way around. Believe it or not, but some of us actually want a smaller government telling us what to do and how to live our lives. There’s a word for that… Liberty. At the same time we want to be able to protect ourselves and our each other from harm that bad people want to perpetuate against us. Think 2nd Amendment. But back to taxes. How does it benefit (me)  - as we all are really thinking. What does it mean for me? I’ll try to make this as simple as possible. Now we are all roughly taxed 25% to 35% on average.  Under this bill it breaks down like so:  ###### If you make:   $0 - $45,000 (single), or 0-$90,000 (married) you pay 12%    $45,001 - $200,000 (single), or $90,001-$260,000 (married) you pay 25%   $200,001 - $500,000 (single), or $260,001 - $1 Million (married) you pay 35%   $500,001+ (single), or $1,000,001+ (married) you pay 39.6%   The standard deduction goes up from $6.3k to $12k for single people, and up from $12.7k to $24k for married people.  The child tax credit goes up from $1k to $1.6k, and you also get a credit of $300 for each non-child dependent or parent that you take care of. That’s pretty neat. People who own a business would pay a pass-through tax of 25% instead of being taxed at the individual rate. Also, during the last parts Senator Ted Cruz had his amendment approved that removes the Healthcare mandate, meaning you don’t pay a fine if you don’t have healthcare. This is probably the most important piece of it for reasons that surpass taxes, alone. We are constantly bombarded with lies and twists that entertain, distract, and disinform us. You were led to believe that this bill was a bad thing, and that it would not benefit you, yet as I outlined above, this is going to mean that you get more each paycheck, and you get to decide how to spend that. This is a huge win for the middle class, and for this country.   The democrat politicians don’t like this and want you to think it’s bad, because if you prosper under this bill, they are going to lose a lot of voters. Just like the media lied about this bill, they’ve also lied about most everything else. Net Neutrality for instance doesn’t protect what it says, in fact there’s an explicit clause in there that allows exactly what they say it protects against. Anything else you can see on the news is also spun to be almost the opposite of what it really is. Especially about our President. He didn’t collude with Russia, the democrats &amp; Hillary did… to sell our Uranium.  This is something that is provable both from recently released FBI documents, and even an FBI informant has come forward with video evidence of briberies taking place between the Russians and Hillary’s state department.    The Manafort indictment wasn’t for something he did during the campaign, it was for his role during the Uranium One deal. Flynn, lied to VP Pence &amp; when questioned by the FBI and not being allowed to have notes with him, and without a lawyer present. If you look into what he did, he was basically doing his job to prevent shit hitting the fan with Russia, because at the time to try and set up the whole “Russia Meddling” in our election, because Hillary didn’t win, Obama imposed some sanctions on Russia. Which they were going to retaliate on us. Flynn basically cooled things down, and Russia didn’t impose retaliatory sanctions. Not only that, but he was given the OK to do so by President Obama’s admin. He didn’t break the law by making the calls he did (he called several other countries).   He lied to the FBI because he knew someone in the investigation would leak it, hence defeating the purpose of his objective. The only way that the FBI would know is because Flynn was wiretapped. That gets into yet another law that may have been broken, because the whole reason the President-Elect Transition team was spied on is based on a false narrative that  the Democrats, Hillary’s team, and the help of a company called FusionGPS put together in order to place the blame on an incoming administration, in an effort to subvert and topple a rightfully elected President. Wikileaks has pretty much admitted that a certain individual from the DNC (who was mysteriously gunned down) was the leaker. They weren’t hacked. The transfer rate of the files is too fast to be going over the internet, it was done locally with a usb device or some sort of drive. physically connected. Also, have you guys actually read those emails? There’s some really interesting and questionable conversations in there. The FBI informant was given a gag order by then Attorney General Loretta Lynch so that he wouldn’t tell Congress that there was bribery going on in order to get 20% of our Uranium. Otherwise, that deal would not have been approved. It goes further and further deeper into many other examples of corruption and criminal acts. Only one person stands in their way. President Trump. A patriot that has been ridiculed, gave up his billionaire lifestyle in an effort to give this country back to whom it belongs. They can’t buy him, they can’t corrupt him, and they can’t outsmart him.  Thanks to him the middle east (Saudi Arabia) is now cleaning up their own swamp. One of the princess arrested had a lot of ties to 9/11 and monetary connections to Citi Group, The DNC, and many of the politicians in congress. Women were finally allowed to drive there. He’s defeated ISIS in Syria, in less than a year in office. He has a long list of accomplishments that have been twisted to sound bad, or not even mentioned at all. Like all the Billions he’s bringing back to the country, and the amazing economy he’s shaped, through his repeals, deregulation, and better trade deals. He’s arrested close to 6,000 human traffickers and saved countless children from sex trafficking. He is doing all of this, whilst fighting all the corruption on all sides of the equation. Democrats and establishment Republicans alike. He’s donating his salary, he is trying to find a way to fix the mess in the middle east, and with North Korea. Many leaders around the world that had lost respect for us, are starting to respect us a lot more than they have in the past. Despite what the news tells us, he’s absolutely loved in places like Japan, Asia, Poland, and so on. You’ve been led to believe that he’s dumb, that he’s a racist, that he’s evil, etc, etc. Lies. He loves this country, and he is one of very few people that could pull this off and take the heat. He’s doing a great job, and he just delivered a Christmas gift to every American. Mark my words ladies and gentlemen, he will be remembered as one our best Presidents of all time.   I can take this all the way back to the principles that founded our country to begin with, and our Bill of Rights. They almost had it all, and he intercepted the ball from the corrupt. Now they want to keep deceiving you, and keep their power at all costs. Even if it means bringing the whole thing down. This tax bill, what it is vs what we were told it was should serve a solid proof that we are constantly lied to in order to shape our emotions and thoughts. We wouldn’t know about the illegalities, if Flynn hadn’t done what he did. Thankfully, this is the genius of President Trump. He is playing 3d Chess, and everyone else is playing checkers. Everything he does is calculated.  The best they can do is twist what he says, or present something out of context, because most won’t look past a headline. Go and watch his full speeches, especially some of his recent ones. Simply AMAZING. He really is putting America (that means you) first. He is cutting waste, and making sure we don’t get ripped off like the TPP or the Paris agreement threatened to do. We are the pound for pound the “greenest” nation in the world.  Yet we were the only ones that were going to  have to pay and reduce our emissions vs other major polluters. The rabbit hole goes deep, and there is a lot to learn, but it all boils down to this. President Trump is the good guy, one of very few. Thanks for reading.  Oh and one more thing… .Almost forgot.  Bill Clinton is a rapist. Infowars.com "

"# The Globalist Takeover of the Internet  Long before fake news or Net Neutrality (N.N.) became major media topics, the U.S. government was already orchestrating a legal crackdown on anything it would eventually label fake news.   N.N. was just one move in a sequence of events to completely take over the internet. *A sequence that happened so slowly none of you noticed it happening at all.* After all, Net Neutrality wasn't even all *that* bad, right? Sure the internet became a quasi-utility, but it didn't *really* affect you. If anything, you got a chance to finally stick it to Comcast! Go you! Right?   But is anything ever that simple?  Ask yourself why N.N. came out of nowhere. Why was it so heavily advertised? Who paid for the advertising? And who benefited from it?   Now ask yourself what sequence led up to N.N. and who led it to there? Where did the sequence intend to end? Believe it or not, the sequence already came to completion. On Obama's final month in office, the internet was quietly nationalized by legislation he signed the day before Christmas Eve. The president himself became legally capable of taking down any website in the United States within minutes. Of course, that was ruined by the election.   This is a long piece, and the beginning will cover some material that you already know but it is crucial to understand the big picture. I split this into two posts, the first one covers the two-decade buildup to Net Neutrality, which I will summarize below for those who are lazy.   ### 1950 - Education   U.S. House of Representatives commissions the Reese Committee to investigate potential communist influence of domestic NGOs and nonprofits. Head investigator, Norman Dodd, [published the final report](https://www.scribd.com/doc/3768227/Dodd-Report-to-the-Reece-Committee-on-Foundations-1954) in which he discovers that the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie foundations were actively influencing universities to promote ""moral relativism"" and ""internationalism"" to the end of ""oligarchic collectivism."" In other words, globalism. [His report was silenced and the two-year investigation was abruptly shut down.](https://youtu.be/YUYCBfmIcHM?t=16)  ### 1980 - Civil Society Sector  The civil society sector is typically understood to be comprised of NGOs and nonprofits that, according to conventional wisdom, engage in humanitarian efforts, human rights advocacy, government accountability, and other international efforts of the sort. But if that was ever true, it isn't anymore, and hasn't been for decades. By 1980 all of civil society had been taken over by private and state interests, operating as proxies for their agendas. Just as Norman Dodd had discovered. [Julian Assange gives the contemporary example of Google Ideas, a think-tank that proxies high-risk endeavors directly for the White House.](https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/) Google Ideas was heavily involved in the Arab Spring, which was instigated by social media. VP of Stratfor said they have a ""covert role in foaming up-risings,"" and that *""they are doing things the CIA cannot do.""*  ### 1990 - Media  [Bill Clinton's Telecommunication Act of 1996](https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.pdf#page=26) legalizes the monopolization of the media, paving the way for a two-decade globalist crusade to consolidate dozens of media outlets into just six. And just like that, the globalists need only pluck six strings to make us dance to their false song. Comcast, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, News Corp, CBS, and still shrinking.  ### 2000 - Social Media  This section is best summarized by a quote from a reddit user.  &gt; ""If you happen to have a right-wing perspective, Google puts your search results on the 10th page, Youtube demonetizes your videos (or removes them), Twitter bans your account, and Facebook censors your posts so they never show up in the news feed."" -/u/spydiggity  ### 2010 - The Internet   The globalists, having solidified their control over banks, education, civil society, media, and social media, now turn their gaze to the crown jewel of their decades-long pursuit: the internet itself.  Already controlling much of the internet's media and all the social media platforms that propagate it, the only thing left for the globalists to control is the infrastructure itself that comprises the internet. That's why ISPs are important now. Before [*Verizon v. FCC*](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3af8b4d938cdeea685257c6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pdf), the FCC classified ISPs under [Title I of Clinton's 1996 Telecommunications Act](https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.pdf#page=7), meaning they acted as **private entities** with minimal regulation from the government. Separate and unrelated to that classification, the FCC held ISPs accountable to the Open-Internet Rules (no throttling, no blocking, no paid-prioritization).   [*Verizon v. FCC*](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-318262A1.pdf) changed that, ruling that if the FCC wanted to enforce Open-Internet Rules they need to re-classify ISPs under [Title II](https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.pdf#page=63) as quasi-utilities strictly regulated as ""common carriers"", effectively a **state-licensed monopoly**. The most critical factor here is that under Title II, ISPs need to apply for *Broadcasting Licenses*, which give the government massive leverage over them. There was an insane amount of influence being exerted over *Verizon v. FCC* by tech companies and their politicians. [Netflix *allegedly* manipulated their own service to frame the ISPs for throttling.](http://techknowledge.center/blog/2014/09/netflix-secretly-holds-subscribers-hostage-to-gain-favorable-fcc-internet-regulations/) The full extent of the influence is not yet known. It may be that the lawsuit's outcome was sheer coincidence. Regardless, this was a huge win for the globalists, because now they are one step closer to *forcing ISPs to apply for Broadcasting Licenses and regularly renew them.* Without a license, the ISPs go bankrupt. The government can leverage this over them. Remember this, because Broadcasting Licenses become the globalist's most valuable weapon in just one act more of legislation.  Three judges presided over the case, two Democrats, one Republican:  - [Laurence H. Silberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Silberman) (appointed by Ronald Reagan)  - [Judith Ann Wilson Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_W._Rogers) (appointed by Bill Clinton)  - [David S. Tatel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Tatel) (appointed by Bill Clinton)  The Clinton-appointee Democrats ruled in favor of the Title II classification ruling. The Reagan-appointee partially dissented. No surprise. Now the FCC is stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they want to enforce Open-Internet they have to practically nationalize the internet, and *any company that wants to offer access to the internet must receive a Broadcasting License.* The FCC is stumped and can't really figure out what to do next... *So Obama comes in to save the day.* He *pressures* them to move forward with the Title II classification and give the government sweeping authority over internet infrastructure. This potentially unpopular move is quickly rebranded with a cute name and sold to the public as... *Net Neutrality*. Surprise!  The public is told that they are saving the internet! But saving it from whom? Hahaha from the very people who are telling them to save it! Whether by intent or by circumstance, the globalists ended up playing both sides and winning. They revoked Open Internet in *Verizon v. FCC*, repackaged it, and gave it back to us in a box full of red tape.  Now here's where the story picks up...  &gt; Net Neutrality invokes Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to require all ISPs and any company that provides internet service to register for Broadcasting Licenses from the government and regularly renew them.   Well... what if the FCC doesn't want to renew them? Ah but that's crazy talk, the FCC can't just revoke Broadcasting Licenses on a whim. It would be taken to court within seconds!   But imagine what happens when you're appointed by the president as chairman of the FCC, and shortly after you get a call. And that call you get is from whatever said globalist president rules your timeline. And that globalist president tells you that a particular ISP needs to have its license revoked because it's violating federal law. Well, you'd probably say ""fuck you I voted for Trump"" and just hang up. But then the office phones start ringing and you get a little nervous because now other government bodies are calling in, all substantiating that yes, in fact, the ISP really is breaking the law. So you hang up, call your lawyer, and ask him to look up all the laws they were talking about to see if the ISP really is violating them. After all, what kind of law would justify such an abuse of power? None, in fact, that you know of. The next thing that will happen is your lawyer will walk into your office, looking pale as a ghost, and hand you a legal document titled *[Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S.2692)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692/text)*.   This is where everything comes together.  Beads of sweat start to form on your forehead as you begin reading the *[Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S.2692)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692/text)*. You put it down and look up at your lawyer, realizing why his face is drained of life. It was drained by the *[Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S.2692)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692/text)*. You're about to ask him a question about the *[Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S.2692)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2692/text)*, but you pause, and another thought strikes you-  ""Why don't they just call it 'The InfoWars Act'?""   Your lawyer simply closes his eyes, as if with erotic satisfaction, and quickly whispers under his breath ""...Bill Clinton is a rapist."" You look back at the InfoWars Act to read its mission statement.  &gt; ...counter foreign propaganda and disinformation from our enemies by establishing an interagency center *housed at the State Department*...""  That's so bizarre, you think to yourself. Usually agencies  are created independent from other branches of government, specifically to preserve accountability and dissuade corrupting influences. Why would you bother creating a new independent agency if you're literally going to house it in the White House?  &gt; interagency ***center***  Okay so it's a center, of *multiple agencies*. In the White House...  &gt; p. 1399 - The head of the Center... shall be appointed by the President.   ...that answers directly to the President? Okay? What exactly is it going to do?  &gt; Maintain, collect, use, and disseminate records for research and data analysis of foreign state and **non-state propaganda** and disinformation efforts  Wait what? Non-state propaganda? You mean like my evening shitposts on T_D? What the fuck does that mean? Literally everyone on the planet is not a state. And how exactly is propaganda defined? Huh, that's strange... there's no definition in here. Like they deliberately omitted it so they can just... call it whatever they want. Incredible.   You look up to your lawyer, ""How the fuck did Obama get this through Congress?""  Your lawyer drops another file on your desk. It looks suspiciously familiar.  ""He didn't.""   The file is titled *[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20161128/CRPT-114HRPT-S2943.pdf)*,   ""He waited until Christmas Eve and hid it inside of the 3,000 page annual military budget so nobody would notice it.""   ""Ohhhh shit yeah this is that fuckin propaganda thing that Obama legalized I always see it get reposted on The Donald! God, what a Kenyan pedophile thing to do, amirite?""  ""So you've already read through it?""  ""Oh... yeah no I'm a simple guy I just see a grey arrow and I make it orange.""    ""Jesus Christ."" The lawyer flips through the 3,076 pages of the NDAA to page 1,396 (or 1,438 in pdf format).  &gt; **[SEC. 1287. GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER.](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20161128/CRPT-114HRPT-S2943.pdf#page=1438)**  ""This is so much more than just propaganda. Look at what they're going to be doing.""   &gt; Identifying current and emerging trends in foreign propaganda and disinformation, including the use of print, broadcast, online and social media, support for third-party outlets such as think tanks, political parties, and nongovernmental organizations, **and the use of covert or clandestine special operators and agents to influence targeted populations** and governments in order to coordinate and shape the development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation  ""Clandestine special operators?? That's like some Tom Clancey shit!""  ""Not even Tom Clancey would write something like this. Earlier you called this a 'Kenyan' thing to do. But even Kenyans have never sent secret agents to brainwash their people. Really let that sink in.""  ""Yeah... Malik Obama would never do that.""  &gt; The legislation establishes a fund to help **train local journalists**...  ""But just when it couldn't get worse... it gets way fucking worse.""  &gt; Second, the legislation seeks to **leverage expertise from outside government**... provide grants and contracts to NGOs, civil society organizations, think tanks, private sector companies, media organizations, and other experts outside the U.S. government...  ""They call in their globalist friends from some ""totally neutral third-party"" and together they can call anyone a propagandist. They can go after literally anybody who's been flagged by a third-party ""fact-checker"" without having to take them to court. ""  ""Oh fuck.""  ""Those fact-checkers were there all along for a reason. They started by flooding the internet with disinformation and then branding the cute term ""fake news"" to generate a demand for fact-checkers. And then they satisfied the demand that they created. They trained the public to accept the idea of ""neutral third-parties"" policing online content. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google, all the tech companies, and *the White House itself* were planning to use bots to auto-flag-and-censor any content that contradicts the fact-checkers... across the entire internet. ""  ""Fuckin' Snopes.""  ""It's brilliant, really. They control the fact-checkers, the enforcers, and with the passage of Title II, the infrastructure to utilize them. Once a propagandist has been targeted, the President can use absolutely anything in the government to stop them.""  &gt; The Center will develop, integrate, and synchronize **whole-of-government** initiatives to expose and counter foreign disinformation operations...  And that's it ladies and gentlemen.  That's why passing Net Neutrality is so important.   The President uses the ""whole-of-government"" to suppress information. Thanks to Net Neutrality's Title II, they can order all ISPs to take down hostile information and any websites that distribute it. If the ISP refuses, their Title II Broadcasting License is **legally revoked**, they can no longer do business, they go bankrupt, and the government buys out their infrastructure. The government can integrate into the ISPs to censor anything, anywhere, at anytime. The ISPs are forced to obey.  STORY TIME IS OVER THIS IS ACTUALLY REAL  Are you imagining how real this is?   They can physically shut down your access to the internet without a court order! Just because someone called you a propagandist! Just because you shitpost on The_Donald! They can take down Drudge Report, Breitbart, The_Donald, 4chan, Voat, and any other right-wing website that pops up to replace it! They would have done this slowly, over the course of years, like they always do, so that nobody would notice until it's too late! They could've taken us down one buy one, year by year, and quietly suppress any online reactions!   **And it was 100% legal! They passed every law they needed to do it!**   YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LUCKY WE ARE TO HAVE WON THE ELECTION BECAUSE THERE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ANOTHER ONE AGAIN.   AND NOW ONE FINAL QUOTE:  &gt; p.1446 - ""The Center shall terminate on the date that is 8 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.""   They thought she would win.  *[LAUGHS IN KENYAN]*  "
The deep state swamp turned on their electronic election machine fractional voting program to make sure a non swamp candidate like Roy Moore was not elected. The same CIA and FBI who plotted against Trump just threw it for Jones. Otherwise the total numbers and last minute swings dont make sense. That is what happened. Stop infighting.

"I see it so much on reddit. They see we post here and they act like we are evil. It really bums me out. Not because of the random nerds on reddit but because people feel like this in real life too.

They resent us because our politics are different than theirs and this is one big ""I didn't get my way so fuck you""??"

"I personally think that the jury decision was a complete joke. San Francisco obviously doesn't know that ""sanctuary cities"" are unconstitutional.

California Democrats are just that desperate for votes and will do and say anything to get them."

Who's obstructing justice except Mueller and Comey and Hillary and Rosenstein and hillarycs team? Their emails prove they were obstructing justice.

...do the snowflakes all seem to condemn Trump as the worst human being to ever exist and turn a complete blind eye when it comes to their own politicians. Boggles my freaking mind! 
"With the globalaists on the run, fake news being proved faker every day, tax bill, illegal immigration down, wall prototypes up, Democrats being outed as sexual predators, Merry Christmas being made great again, gdp seeing record highs, muh Russia being btfo, political correctness being destroyed, holy smokes the list goes on.

"A number of people have been taken down in the entertainment industry.   Then it moved on to politics where democrats are accused but won't step down while Roy Moore is supposed to step down with fake accusations, forged yearbook, and vindictive women bitter about court case that didn't go their way.  Here comes Billy Bush out of left field, eager to get his entertainment employment back. I think the timing is suspect and time will tell if Billy Bush turns on Trump here shortly."

Sessions is the worst thing that's happened to this administration. He opened it up perpetual attack by hiring and protecting its enemies and it has caused a lot of damage. It must end now
" And it came to pass, in man's hour of need, when the land and country blessed by God was on the verge of dictatorship and destruction, the followers of the Lord called out to him for mercy and redemption.   And God spoke back, hearing the cries of the many and seeing the wicked ways of the men oppressing his children, and as he saw, he commanded from above that a prophet be sent down to guide and choose a wise man to save his children.  And he spoke, ""Let there be Kek. Now go unto the land and into the air, through all forms of viewing for my children, be found and known as Pepe, and be with my children as I am with you. Upon the Earth you must find a wise and powerful lion to defend the land which your God has blessed.""  And Pepe set out, giving red pill after red pill to the chosen children of the Lord, on his journey to seek out the lion, Donald Trump, and name him leader of the free world that God hath blessed."

"""Trump argued that the financial crisis allowed him to invoke the extraordinary event clause in his contract with the bank. Mr. Trump argued Deutsche Bank should pay him $3 billion in damages. The bank filed its own action against Mr. Trump""  Russia laundered through this bank, Trump used this bank. Somehow the above circumstances mean that Trump was given favor by Deutsche Bank. He was literally fighting with them.  **There is no indication that federal investigators suspect a Russian connection to Mr. Trump’s dealings with Deutsche Bank, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Horowitz, of the real estate firm Cooper-Horowitz, also saw no Russian ties in his many years of working with Mr. Trump.**  And in May, federal prosecutors settled a case with a Cyprus investment vehicle owned by a Russian businessman with close family connections to the Kremlin. The firm, Prevezon Holdings, was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya,  The Lawyer paid by the DNC/Fusion GPS. So what point is trying to be made here in relation to 2016 Russian Election Collusion."

I’m currently in an EU country doing work in a higher learning institution. What I saw happen is completely scary and has present a clear and present danger to the community here. The EU sent out questionnaires to students asking a wide range of very sensitive questions abou the EU and communism. However nothing is mention in the questions that the EU is a modern version of the USSR and the wording of the questions made it out that the EU was a benevolent form of government. Both are bad. I felt like the questions preyed on the students whom do not have the political knowledge or capacity to answer the questions. I feel like the results used will try to supress the government under further EU regulations. These questions were so volatile that releasing them with blank answers would cause severe repurcussions on myself and others. Currently we are trying to figure out who all got the questions. If it is state wide I will try to release them. I will update further on.
"i think the guys name is ari something, i cant remember his name, or who he works for though "
There's truth in this world after all.
Two bombshell fake news stories about Trump and the Special Counsel have dropped in the last week. Both times the stock market has plummeted. What if the anonymous source in these articles knows this and how to profit from it until a correction comes out a few hours later? 
"Well you almost had me fooled, @@@@@! But your arrogance and self defeating compulsion to underestimate me have now exposed you! All the pieces of the puzzle have been identified. You couldn't help yourself. You couldn't resist dangling the truth right in front of my face, believing I'd never see it. But the picture is now clear.  Beginning with the immediate red flags, the lies, the multiple boyfriends, the constant underlying shallowness to the copious amounts of love and affection @@@@@ poured onto me, there was always something so strange about our relationship. Something so phony.  Once I stumbled onto information about narcissistic personality disorder, and learned about the concepts of GASLIGHTING and TRAUMA BONDING, finding my experience with @@@@@ to be a textbook example of a relationship with a narcissist, I might have been content to leave it at that. But there was always some nagging feeling that I was still missing something.  There were often some very strange things that would come out of @@@@@'s mouth. Granted, these things might be attributable simply to her personality disorder, and inevitably, the standard reaction to what I am about to reveal will be incredulity and more concern for my mental health. But my instincts do not waiver on this. I know what has happened to me now.  If your skepticism demands it, think of this as one final joke... a rhetorical defense mechanism I have devised to serve as my emotional escape from the clutches of a toxic, seductive sociopath. But I am aware of the world we live in. I know the people who made it the way it is. And I know the depth of their depravity knows no limit.  Following the inevitable narcissistic discard and devastating heartbreak, I found myself tragically uninterested in all the things I previously enjoyed. This is common among victims of narcissists. Distracted while ensnared, then too damaged and unstable to rediscover lost passions in the aftermath.  BUT YOU'VE ALL UNDERESTIMATED ME.  Prior to becoming involved with @@@@@, my greatest passion was my reignited sense of hope for my son's, and indeed, all of humanity's future as Donald Trump rose to political prominence by virtue of his unique and miraculous immunity to malignant banker globalist overlords' media driven sociological manipulation.  Trump had finally given a voice to those of us who saw through the unfathomable dirty tactics, corruption, and collusion of the two parties, and constructed a beacon for anyone who recognized the deadly urgency required to prevent those few remaining steps to all out worldwide oppression from being taken.  During the 2016 campaign, I garnered much attention with my intense support of Trump, writing much about globalism and media corruption, engaging in heated debates while refusing to allow mindless partisan faux issues to distract attention from the real ones like the moral and economic failure of free trade with nations who oppress their laborers and our history of borderline genocidal foreign policy that both parties supported and perpetuated to secure their own personal interests.  We were successful in winning the White House, but shortly after Trump took office, my voice was suddenly silenced, as I was too busy being swept off my feet to participate or even keep up with current events. Ultimately, I would be driven to the brink of madness, certainly sacrificing whatever credibility I might have had and scorching the earth to find revenge and nonexistent closure to the emotional abuse I endured at @@@@@'s hands.  I might have never put it all together without the help of my anti globalist colleague #####, who pointed out to me how irrational and counterproductive my behavior had become. Using the blue pill/ red pill imagery, he triggered my brain to reset itself, breaking me FREE from the narcissistic mind control techniques that had been implemented against me, finally allowing me a clear perspective of my relationship with @@@@@. Red pilling me all over again!  As I reflected, the horrifying but undeniable truth flooded my thoughts. I began to research and, within minutes, I learned the term ""honeypot"" which named a concept I was already familiar with as a pop culture trope. I read the words of whistleblowers like Ed Snowden and George Webb who revealed the global establishment's willingness to use such tactics against its enemies. I read about government's findings about GASLIGHTING and TRAUMA BONDING as effective MIND CONTROL techniques. I read about how honeypot agents are recruited through troubled teen sanctuaries, which would provide access to victims of child sex trafficking. George Webb's writings describe how they are introduced to drugs and trained to be honeypots for the purpose of coaxing government secrets out of their victims, setting them up for potential blackmail, making accusations to damage their credibility, or simply driving them to insanity in order to neutralize them as political threats.  Some strange things that came out of @@@@@'s mouth during our time together included her claims to having been sold as a child for sex slavery, an explanation that she was still being blackmailed into doing certain things for those traffickers, who included ""mayors, police officers, city officials, judges""; while @@@@@ and I were watching American Ultra, when the girlfriend admits to having been his CIA handler all along, I had an epiphany and jokingly asked @@@@@ ""Baby... are you my CIA handler?"" She reacted strangely to that, but then laughed it off, saying ""look at you, figuring me out..."" she went on to say ""Not the CIA... but I have done some freelance work for the NSA... I can't really talk about it..."" I just kinda rolled my eyes and wrote it off as more of that looney tunes charm I was doomed to find irresistible, and finally, near the end of the first narcissistic hoover, ##### and I were at her trailer when he pointed to her drawing on the wall that contained the Eye of Providence. He asked @@@@@ why she had Illuminati symbols in her drawing, to which she replied with no hint of irony, ""I am Illuminati.""  It is clear to me now that @@@@@ is an NSA honeypot agent assigned to establish an emotionally volatile relationship with me for the purpose of distracting me from being an outspoken sworn enemy of the banker globalist establishment, sabotage my mental health, destroy my credibility, and perhaps ultimately coerce me into violence or otherwise damage my character with criminal accusations.  BUT YOU GLOBALIST SCUM WON'T GET THE BEST OF ME.  By violating me so intimately, you have created a FAR MORE VICIOUS ENEMY than you could have ever imagined. I am hereby rejoining the fight to bring you down. I vow to expose operations like these and to warn the red pilled ones everywhere about what you're trying to do. I will spread word to every forum, every outlet, every source for real news that aims to destroy you, and that will only be the beginning.  Your trap was clever. She performed her duties flawlessly. You could not have found a more effective weapon to use against me. It only failed because this is not your world anymore. The people are taking it BACK. Yours is a losing battle. We're going to have each other's backs, and we are going to defeat you. THE WAR IS BACK ON!"
"Like his lawyer said, he has a story to tell. "
"Trump is on the right course, jobs jobs jobs plus illegal immigration costs the US a fortune. His tax cut is the first good news middle America have had in way too long."
"Archive http://archive.is/ad2vP  So basically these are two stories each describing a mystery document, maybe an email, described slightly differently in each article, that was ""discovered"" last year, showing DWS emailing skittish donor saying LYNCH assured them there would be no HRC prosecution, ahem, matter.  These stories are just ODD to read and the document itself is so strangely described in both.    From NYT:  &gt;A document obtained by the F.B.I. reinforced that idea. During Russia’s hacking campaign against the United States, intelligence agencies could peer, at times, into Russian networks and see what had been taken. Early last year, F.B.I. agents received a batch of hacked documents, and one caught their attention. &gt;The document, which has been described as both a memo and an email, was written by a Democratic operative who expressed confidence that Ms. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far, according to several former officials familiar with the document.  From WaPo even weirder: &gt;The Russian document cited a supposed email describing how then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch had privately assured someone in the Clinton campaign that the email investigation would not push too deeply into the matter. If true, the revelation of such an understanding would have undermined the integrity of the FBI’s investigation. &gt;Current and former officials have said that Comey relied on the document in making his July decision to announce on his own, without Justice Department involvement, that the investigation was over. That public announcement — in which he criticized Clinton and made extensive comments about the evidence — set in motion a chain of other FBI moves that Democrats now say helped Trump win the presidential election. &gt;But according to the FBI’s own assessment, the document was bad intelligence — and according to people familiar with its contents, possibly even a fake sent to confuse the bureau. The Americans mentioned in the Russian document insist they do not know each other, do not speak to each other and never had any conversations remotely like the ones described in the document. Investigators have long doubted its veracity, and by August the FBI had concluded it was unreliable. &gt;The document, obtained by the FBI, was a piece of purported analysis by Russian intelligence, the people said. It referred to an email supposedly written by the then-chair of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), and sent to Leonard Benardo, an official with the Open Society Foundations, an organization founded by billionaire George Soros and dedicated to promoting democracy. &gt;The Russian document did not contain a copy of the email, but it described some of the contents of the purported message. &gt;In the supposed email, Wasserman Schultz claimed Lynch had been in private communication with a senior Clinton campaign staffer named Amanda Renteria during the campaign. The document indicated Lynch had told Renteria that she would not let the FBI investigation into Clinton go too far, according to people familiar with it.  and this insane bit here about how it could've been used--after some discussion of how no one knows b/c FBI never bothered to interview them about it: &gt;“It was a very powerful factor in the decision to go forward in July with the statement that there shouldn’t be a prosecution,” said a person familiar with the matter. “The point is that the bureau picked up hacked material that hadn’t been dumped by the bad guys [the Russians] involving Lynch. And that would have pulled the rug out of any authoritative announcement.” &gt;Other people familiar with the document disagree sharply, saying such claims are disingenuous because the FBI has known for a long time that the Russian intelligence document is unreliable and based on multiple layers of hearsay.     So I'm wondering now, is this document on the DNC DWS computer she is trying to keep secret in Awan probe?  Is it something Seth Rich copied and was planning to sell or give to Wikileaks etc? Is it real? Not real?  Destroyed? I mean WTF and why was all this print dedicated to it??"
bwahahaaaaha

“There are like phrases and words.”                          Utter garbage from the liberals with no brains.  Math is tough. How can they lie to so many Americans about this Tax Reform. (https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1809801372384678/)
So the crazies are now saying that because Trump tweeted about Flynn having lied to FBI that Trump has obstructed Justice. How desperate can they get. Thier tantrums have gone from amusing to irritating. Instead of working on making the country better they are just focused on removing Trump. Fucking pathetic.
"I am losing patience with what's happening in my home state. Everything from the HIV misdemeanor law to the ""sanctuary state"" status is making me want to move out, even though I know that I can't. I just have to wait and see when California will turn red again. I am eagerly awaiting the legislation to be run by republicans again. It may take ten years, maybe more. But it'll be worth it.  Don't get me wrong. I love my home state, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. I just don't think that the people running the government are qualified to run it. This would be a great time to Make California Red Again. In the meantime, I'll be staying in Orange County, where it's still predominately right-leaning. I don't think I'd survive in a place like San Francisco, where it appears to be batshit insane."
Suggestions please
This is a bunch of questions I hope someone can help me i understanding.  I think Tax Reform had to be done first to unite the Republican party and get an important legislative win.  1. Why doesn't Trump just declassify the FISA warrants? Blow it the fuck open? 2. What happens if Congress censures FBI for not providing documents? What is the next step? 3. Do you think Trump is prepping the way to hire his own Special Counsel? 4. And when the fuck is WiIlliam Campbell testifying? 
"With all that Strzok has had his hand in,  what are the odds he is who swore under oath before the FISA court to obtain the warrant to go after GEOTUS and his staff?"
"He's basically claiming that Project Vertias deals in lies and deception to catch Washington Post employees. Last I checked, Washington Post lies well enough on its own."

"I'm posting this excerpt from the book *Watergate: The Hoax* because these **exact same operations** are being run right now, right in front of us on our POTUS and on us. Quoting below the first part of the Appendix III of this amazing exposé of the crimes of the CIA, this being ""The CIA Psyops of Watergate and Beyond."" The entire appendix is available online here and is a must-read:   http://www.chaletbooks.com/chaletreports/?p=810  Here's is just the first part of it, as fair use:  Appendix III: The CIA Psyops of Watergate and Beyond  This is a warning: Watergate is a mine field of psychological operations techniques—PSYOPS. You’re free to ignore this warning. You can turn right to the first chapter and read this book without reading this appendix. The book was conceived and crafted as a path through that mine field, so you will come out the other end intact either way.  Your understanding and appreciation of what you’re walking through in reading it, though, will be greatly enhanced by investing a few minutes in reviewing some of the more deadly PSYOPS techniques that you’ll encounter—from a safe distance.  This appendix doesn’t pretend to be an exhaustive study of such black psychological techniques; it merely outlines major ones used in the packaging and selling of a CIA hoax of remarkable scope that is commonly known as “Watergate.”  “HISTORY” BY MANUFACTURED CONFESSION  Watergate is largely a false universe of purported history made up of some truth and a great many lies, most being in the form of “confessions.” It is an infinitely elastic universe, because its sum can’t possibly exist except in each individual perceiver’s mind. Once the volunteered “confessions” and accounts and testimony are closely compared, so many contradictions emerge that in order for much of Watergate to have happened at all, a universe with multiple time streams is required.  These contradictions aren’t the result of mere misperceptions by different eyewitnesses; these are cooked, manufactured fictions by people supposedly “confessing” their acts and the acts of others, or “confessing” a false purpose for certain acts. Their accounts of events, and of several staged phony “events,” contain elements of PSYOPS that are planted for no other purpose than to confuse, and, by confusing, to deflect close inspection and comparison that would reveal the lies.  This goes beyond what is commonly referred to in the intelligence trade as a “limited hangout”: voluntarily confessing to certain sins to deflect attention from others that are far more serious.  CONTRADICTIONS TO CREATE CONFUSION  A time-honored and favorite intelligence technique for creating confusion is to supply two separate and contradictory accounts of what purportedly is the same event. The mind locks. It cannot be resolved. No certain truth can be reached about the time span of the event, because both contradictory accounts cannot be true. The mind is forced to make a choice between two accounts that might both be false, or to leave it unresolved, yet still attempt to link that enduring mystery to other claimed or actual events that depend on it, or that take place around it. The landscape of Watergate is littered with such mental traps.  Read the rest: http://www.chaletbooks.com/chaletreports/?p=810"

JEFF SESSIONS IS USELESS AND IM SICK OF IT 
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/03/clinton-should-run-for-tom-cottons-senate-seat-216001
"**from U.S. Senate floor 2017.12.07 @ 11:50am EDT**  **Senator Al Franken**  A couple of months ago I felt that we had entered an important moment in the history of this country. We were finally beginning to listen to women about the ways in which mens actions affect them. The moment was long overdue.  I was excited for that conversation and hopeful that it would result in real change that made life better for women all across the country and in every part of our society. Then the conversation turned to me. Over the last few weeks a number of women have come forward to talk about how they felt my actions had affected them. I was... I was shocked. I was upset. But in responding to their claims I also wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation. Because all women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously. I think that was the right thing to do.  I also think it gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that in fact I haven't done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently. I said at the outset that the ethics committee was the right venue for these allegations to be heard and investigated and evaluated on their merits, that I was prepared to cooperate fully and that I was confident in the outcome.  You know an important part of the conversation we've been having the last few months has been about how men abuse their power and privilege to hurt women. I am proud that during my time in the Senate I have used my power to be a champion of women and that I have earned a reputation as someone who respects the women I work alongside everyday. I know there has been a very different picture of me painted over the last few weeks but I know who I really am.  Serving in the United States Senate has been the great honour of my life. I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a Senator, nothing, has brought dishonour on... on this institution. And I am confident that the ethics committee would agree. Nevertheless today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as member of the United States Senate. I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office. And a man who has repeated preyed on young girls, campaigns for the Senate with the... with the full support of his party. But this decision is not about me. It's about the people of Minnesota. It's become clear that I can't both pursue the ethics committee process and at the same time remain an effective senator for them. Let me be clear, I may be resigning my seat but I am not giving up my voice. I will continue to stand up for the things I believe in as a citizen and as an activist. But Minnesotans but deserve a senator who can focus with all her energy on addressing the challenges they face every day.  There is a big part of me that will always regret having to walk away from this job with so much work left to be done. But I have faith that the work will continue because I have faith in the people who have helped me do it.  I have faith in the dedicated, funny, selfless, brilliant, young men and women on my staff. They have so much more to contribute to our country. And I hope that as disappointed as they may feel today, everyone who has worked for me knows how much I admire and respect them.  I have faith in my colleagues, especially my senior senator Amy Klobuchar. I would have not been able to do this job without her guidance and wisdom. And I have faith or at least hope that members of this senate will find the political courage necessary to keep asking the tough questions, to hold this administration accountable and stand up for the truth.  I have faith in the activists who organized to help me win my first campaign and who kept on organizing to help fight for the people who needed it. Kids facing bullying. Seniors worried about the price of prescription drugs. Native Americans who have been overlooked for far too long. Working people who have been taking it on the chin for a generation. Everyone in the middle class and everyone aspiring to join it.  I have faith in the proud legacy of progressive advocacy that I have had the privilege to be a part of. I think I have probably repeated these words 10,000 times over the years, Paul Wellstone's famous quote; ""The future belongs to those who are passionate and work hard."" It's still true. It will always be true.  And most of all I have faith in Minnesota. A big part of this job is going around this state and listening what people need from Washington. But more often than not, when I'm home I am blown away by how much Minnesota has to offer the entire country and the entire world. The people I have had the honour of representing are brilliant and creative and hardworking and whoever holds this seat next will inherit the challenge I have enjoyed for the last 8½ years being as good as the people you serve.  This has been a tough few weeks for me but I am a very very lucky man. I have a beautiful healthy family that I love and that loves me very much. I am going to be just fine.  I'd just like to end with one last thing. I did not grow up wanting to be a politician. I came to this relatively late in life. I had to learn a lot on the fly. It wasn't easy and it wasn't always fun and I'm not just talking about today. This is a hard thing to do with your life. There are a lot of long hours, late nights and hard lessons. And there is no guarantee that all your work and sacrifice will ever pay off. I won my first election by 312 votes. It could have easily gone the other way. And even when you win, progress is far from inevitable. Paul Wellstone spent his whole life working for mental health parity and it didn't pass until 6 years after Paul died.  This year a lot of people who didn't grow up imagining that they'd ever get involved in politics have done just that. They've gone to their first protest march, or made their call to a member of congress. Or maybe even taken the leap and put their names on a ballot for the first time.  It can be such a rush to look around a room of... full of people ready to fight along side you. Too feel that energy. To imagine that better things are possible. But you too will experience setbacks, defeats and disappointments. There will be days when you will wonder if it's worth it.  What I want you to know, that even today, on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it's all been worth it. Politics, Paul Wellstone told us, is about the improvement of people's lives. I know that the work I have been able to do has improved people's lives. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. For a decade now, every time I would get tired or discouraged or frustrated, I would think about the people I was doing this for and it would get me back up on my feet. I know the same will be true for everyone who decides to pursue politics that is about improving people's lives. And I hope you know that I will be fighting alongside of you every step of the way. "
"TL;DR. I haven't heard any of this Happy Holidays bullshit anymore.   I hear Merry Christmas so much now, even in liberal areas. Here are my real-life examples of evidence that I have seen since Trump has become President.  1. I have gone out to dinner with my family, at ""high-class"" and ""low-class"" places (steak houses to diners and pizza places), I would say 20 times since Thanksgiving, and every single waiter or waitress has said Merry Christmas, before we could say something.  2. My friend works as a waitress and has said Merry Christmas to hundreds of people, and has gotten back Merry Christmas every single time. The manager on the floor tried to have her fired for saying that, he was fired by the owner, for not allowing Merry Christmas to be said to the customers.   3. Stores around me are showing signs that say Merry Christmas, or Christmas sales, not Holiday or Winter sales.   4. Radio station sign offs for Christmas music are saying Merry Christmas before the Happy Holidays, and sometimes not at all.   5. My mother's Holiday party at work was changed to a Christmas party again.   6. My college professors are even saying it in their last emails to us, and in their last classes, when handing in final papers, or taking finals.   7. Liberals are saying on twitter that saying Merry Christmas is racist. They are using the racist card, so that means we are really winning folks!  Now Yesterday, my family and I went into the city, these are five true, real-life examples.  1. We went to get tickets to Christmas for my aunt and uncle to see Wicked. The ticket booth guy said Merry Christmas to me and my mother.  2. We go to Bryant Park, to the little shops there, we pay the cashier, who is black and she says Merry Christmas.   3. We went to the tree, and all around, you heard people being nice to each other, strangers taking photos for couples, all saying the same thing, Merry Christmas.   4. We go to a HOT DOG STAND to get some dirty water dogs, the guy says Merry Christmas. (It was outside of the legends house tho, so maybe we can't count that one)  5. We went to Greenwich Village, yes THE Village. We get some doughnuts, and the Haitian owner who helped us said, Merry Christmas.    Remember these stories from yesterday are from NEW YORK CITY! The liberal mecca itself.  Things they are a-changing, and in the greatest way possible. President Trump really has made Christmas Great Again. "

"Is GEOTUS fading in a presidential new look??  Watching the Pensacola rally, he’s looking a little darker on the sides. He’s on fire now but a little salt N pepper look??? SEXAY!!! "
I been searching on here and throughout the web with no luck
That's what I hear every time I hear Linda Sarsour. Carry on pedes. 
"And I believe that He punishes those who sin. In the Old Testament, he flooded the earth due the evil of humans. After the flood he gave the rainbow as a covenant with humanity that he would never flood the earth again. The next cleanse will come with fire. What if, serious question, the more frequent fires and earthquakes in California are God showing that perhaps the time is coming for another cleanse. With how evil and vile California is and has become it only makes sense. Just stuff I think about I guess. Let’s all hope that President Trump can prevent the entire country from falling into fire. God bless you all!"
"#It's already the law of the land.  **Highlights from the [Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995](https://www.congress.gov/104/plaws/publ45/PLAW-104publ45.pdf)**  &amp;nbsp;  *SEC. 2. FINDINGS.*  The Congress makes the following findings:  (1) **Each sovereign nation, under international law and custom, may designate its own capital.**  (2) Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the State of Israel.  (3) The city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of numerous government ministries and social and cultural institutions.  (4) The city of Jerusalem is the spiritual center of Judaism, and is also considered a holy city by the members of other religious faiths.  [...]  *SEC. 3. TIMETABLE.*  (a) STATEMENT OF THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.—  (1) Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected;  (2) **Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel; and**  (3) **the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.**  &amp;nbsp;  A little late perhaps, but as a great American once said:  ""Sorry to keep you waiting.  Complicated business."""
"CNN's Donald Trump Jr./Wikileaks story was utterly false and needed to be retracted, after being plastered all over their front page. Devin Nunes was cleared of any wrongdoing, rejoined the House Intel Committee in the Russia probe and he is unleashing his wrath. The forgery of Roy Moore's signature came to light less than 24 hours after Franken resigned and just a few days before the election. Strong November jobs report. MSNBC's Liberal Joe contributor suspended over sexual misconduct allegations.  Am I missing something? Even if I am, this list is still pretty damning.."
Claps are weak. Let's have a thunderous applause for Tom Fitton and his team at Judicial Watch. They are really trying and prying to get the truth for the American people. More republicans need to do what is right and start speaking and tweeting about the issues the President and Judicial Watch are bringing to light. 
"Everything coming out now shows how deep the fix was in. I don't believe they just looked the other way anymore, I think they led the way.  The question is why. Its like HRC was the center of the universe for them. We know it was obvious to everyone she's a criminal and we've heard of her nasty behavior towards people so why go so far out on a limb for her?   I do believe if we could get 1 high profile person who was close to her to come out and admit things the dominos would start falling. It would only take one person for more to come out, just like with the sexual harassment stuff."

And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.   And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

"GEOTUS is the universal expert at multi-dimensional chess. He just said that inner cities are improving at his Pensacola rally. MSM BTFO! They lose regardless of what they publish. Either they have to admit he's right, or they don't and admit that inner cities have become horrible shitholes."
This is war
"On his way to boarding AF1 he told the press that it's a shame Flynn lied once to the FBI and they destroyed his life, Hillary lied non stop to FBI and she got nothing. It's a shame. "
The deep state is going to go through with their farce and try to impeach Trump and day now. They'll fail miserably as always but they're doing damage to his reputation. The arrests of the swamp must begin now
-icated to being the greatest nation on Earth again.  We are winning so much it's unbelievable!!!!
Maybe not even the day. Out out out.
He's not resigning. This announcement was to stop the flood of women coming forward. Then after the holiday season he will be back hoping the news cycle will have moved on.  He will only follow through and resign if we keep the pressure up in January.
"I have to hide my Kek worship. I can’t wear my MAGA hat to the office.  I’m the classic shy Trump Voter.  Why I wouldn’t be fired for coming out as a trump voter I know that it would be the end of line for promotions and the start of being forced out.  I’m between a rock and hard place and I’m not as strong as Trump. One hand I can hide and a work deny worshiping GEOTUS and enjoy an easy life. The other hand ,to thine own self be true, and come out as Trump supporter and face hardships and suffering for it. What should I do?"
I don’t know how to.

"Strzok, The disgraced guy fired from Muellers team for his obvious bias against President Trump and protection of Hillarycs crimes is now back at the FBI going through everyones files at human resources . THAT'S not a problem. (and how did he get his job back at the FBI? Is it a revolving door for Trump haters?)   And his hidden affair with Page apparently is no problem as they moved her there with him so they can continue to break sexual harassment guidelines at the FBI. #MeToo  Why the hell arent they both on suspension?   http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/06/over-10000-texts-between-ex-mueller-officials-found-after-discovery-anti-trump-messages.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fpolitics+%28Internal+-+Politics+-+Text%29   &gt;Strzok, who was an FBI counterintelligence agent, had worked on the Mueller probe, but was reassigned to the FBI’s human resources department after the discovery of anti-Trump text messages with Page, with whom he was having an affair. Page was briefly on Mueller’s team, but since has returned to the FBI.  I find it stunning he would be brought backo the FBI at all and even more stunning he would be put in such a sensitive area as Human Resources. The son of a bitch is probably loading up on job threatening blackmail possibilites against anyone at the FBI who supports Trump. "

Democrats haven't done shit. The only votes they have casted Yes for is to impeach the President. And in the ultimate irony vote to keep the President. Trump has lasted 1 Year. How many times have Republicans got to have a impeachment vote for Obama? I know there were articles but did they ever act on them? 
Vote Roy Moore!

"Given the track record of the left, and their obsession with projection, it is statistically more likely that Doug Jones is an evil, sick bastard."
"If Moore loses tomorrow, I believe we will see allegations of sexual misconduct against more and more GOP candidates going forward. Sexual assault is a serious criminal matter, and yet the left wants to use it for political theater. Everyone deserves their day in court, and our system holds that someone is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If someone is accused, investigate the allegations and then determine their validity. But to assume guilt automatically is wrong. Why do leftists and feminists believe that sexual misconduct should be held to a “guilt by accusation alone” standard?"

"His term was set to expire in 2020. I believe that the Governor will be appointing someone to fill his seat. Do they move the election up? Will it be with the midterms and if so, does that mean that there will be two Minnesota Senate seats up for grabs in the 2018 Midterms?"

"And you pedes thought the Enron execs were scum.  Turns out it was the investigators who were scum and inventing charges.   Keep in mind as you read this that Mueller knew all of this before he tapped Weissemann to be his #2.  &gt;Weissmann, as deputy and later director of the Enron Task Force, **destroyed the venerable accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP and its 85,000 jobs worldwide — only to be reversed several years later by a unanimous Supreme Court.** Next, Weissmann creatively criminalized a business transaction between Merrill Lynch and Enron. Four Merrill executives went to prison for as long as a year. Weissmann’s team made sure they did not even get bail pending their appeals, even though the charges Weissmann concocted, like those against Andersen, were literally unprecedented.  &gt;Weissmann’s prosecution devastated the lives and families of the Merrill executives, causing enormous defense costs, unimaginable stress and torturous prison time. **The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the mass of the case.**  http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/356253-judging-by-muellers-staffing-choices-he-may-not-be-very-interested-in  Spez: formatting"

All they care about is what is in it for me? If it furthers the cause even better but that's an after thought. Migrant attorneys just are drooling over current loopholes while fleecing their clients without wanting change. The top agent in the FBI wanted more of the same ole without changes.  Democrats sold out our culture for votes. It's just plain evil and every angle pushed by the left benefits their own person first and the group they represent as an after thought. It should not be surprising that their roll model is Hillary Clinton. After all she sold out the country for her own personal enrichment for Billions and is a perfect roll model in their book. The proof is they wanted more of the same at our country's expense. Still do and are desperate to have their old Obama ways back.
"Trump won AL by ~ 20 points  You really think the voters got gaslit that much? Or Moore was that bad of a candidate even though he was openly pro maga?  Possible, but the margin for voter turnout would not be this bad as conservatives across America--especially conservative AL--know what's at stake if the Dems gain any momentum  There's many things happening but one of them is not a fair and legal election"

"As a scottish person I grew up in the shadow of American Greatness. I grew up on a diet of American TV programs and US memes. This is what I dreamt about. Whether or not the artists i refer to subscribe to current political affiliations is immaterial (most have already been bought out in dollars or bullets I fear).    i want to start posting artifacts of US popular culture that endure (for me at least).  This is Eric Johnson.  Like other extraordinary talents I wondered what strange set of circumstances would collude to create such wonderful talent. My only explanation is that there was( and soon be again) so unique formula of space freedom and creativity that America affords, hard work and genius that made (will make again) might produce such excellence.  I implore other pedes to remind us of WMAGITFP (What made America Great in the first place)    "

"PJW said it best... ""Imagine my shock..."""
"From mumsnet, a poster responds to someone saying she used hate speech   Remember me when you have your first baby and you're referred to throughout your pregnancy as a birthing individual, a pregnant person, and it makes you feel kind of dehumanised and you wish they'd just call you a woman, a mother, because that's what you are. But they're not allowed, because it's illegal to say only women can be pregnant and give birth.  Remember me when you give birth and you feel vulnerable and exposed and you really want a woman beside you who understands what you're going through and instead your midwife is a six foot man with stubble in a dress and you know he isn't a woman but you're not allowed to object, even when you need to be examined and you just want a woman to do it but you know you can't say anything because that would be hate speech, even though your body is screaming no.  Remember me when your elderly mother, who has lost her mind to dementia, goes into a care home and is told that her carer, Susan, is a woman, because you asked that she only be cared for by women. And even in her addled state of mind, she knows that Susan is a man, and you know Susan is a man, but you cannot object, and she has to allow Susan to perform her intimate care, because to object would be hate speech.  Remember me when your daughter comes home from school crying, the daughter who has spent the last five years training to be the best athlete in her class, her school, her district, she's crying because Lucas in her class, one of the fastest boys, has decided he identifies as female for now and so is allowed to run in her race, and she knows it doesn't matter how hard she trains, he will always beat her, and she can only ever hope for a silver medal now. Or bronze, if there is another Lucas.   Remember me when you go into a toilet late at night, perhaps in a bar, and there's noone else around, and a guy walks in, he has a beard and is wearing jeans and a t shirt, and the way he looks at you seems off, and you feel afraid and unsettled and worried he might hurt you. But you can't challenge him, because if you do he'll say he's a woman and has as much right as you do to be in this toilet, a place where many years ago you might have come to feel safe.  Remember me when you go for a promotion, for a board position at work that's designated for a woman. You've put in the hours, you've worked so hard, you know you deserve it. And the position goes to Lola, who until last year was a 50 year old man. Lola will never do anything inconvenient like needing time off to have babies, or to deal with any health issues that you, a woman might face, like endometriosis, breast cancer, PND. Lola is a woman just like you, and your company are happy that they have fulfilled their quota of women members on the board.  Remember me when you read on the news that crime statistics for women committing rape and murder are on the increase, and now women carry out a much higher number of rapes and murders than they did when you were a teenager or a young woman. And you know that these 'women' are men and that the statistics are wrong, but to challenge this would be hate speech. Remember me too, when these women rapists are locked up with vulnerable women in female prisons and cannot escape, because to challenge the presence of the women rapists with penises in prison with them would be hate speech.  Remember me when your son comes home from school and says that he's learned at school that you can change sex and that some girls have penises and some boys have vaginas and that his teacher said that because he likes playing with girls and dolls that maybe he is really a girl in the wrong body. And you think, no, you are just my wonderful, unique, son, and you were born in your own body. Remember me when a few months down the line the teacher calls you in and says she's concerned that you are not validating your son's identity and that she's noticed you are still referring to him by the name you so carefully chose for him when he was born, and calling him a boy, when he is actually a girl, and that she doesn't want to have to involve social services but she's worried she might have to if you continue to misgender your son and deny his real identity. And you know that she will, because it's happened before in a school near you, and you are afraid.  In this brave new world that you helped to create, look around for your transactivist friends, your lefty male allies, the ones you stood beside and yellled 'terf, transphobe, bigot' with, with you shouting the loudest, because you wanted to show what a good ally you were, how inclusive, how progressive. Where are they now? Why, they are where they always were. Benefitting from the patriarchy. Enjoying the new, improved version of it that you helped them to build by crushing the resistance from the women who spoke up for their rights. This has all cost them nothing; it has made the world a better, easier place for men. It has cost you and your sisters who campaigned with them for virtue cookies, everything.  And me? I'll be where I've always been. Fighting for your rights. Fighting to undo the damage.   I'll have your back, as I always have done."
One thing we know for sure.  GUN CONTROL would NOT have prevented Kate Steinle's murder.  But IMMIGRATION CONTROL would have.  Illegal aliens and other criminals will ALWAYS be able to get their hands on weapons.  DEPORT.  NO AMNESTY.  BUILD THAT WALL.  PROTECT THE 2nd AMENDMENT.  MAGA.

"Roy Moore seemed to be a good enough candidate to win the Alabama special election.  He held all the right positions for a state as red as this one.  He lost because accusers crawled out of the woodwork and damaged his character.  Even with so many facts pointing to these accusations being untrue, they still had enough impact to swing this election.    So, what's to stop the Democrats from doing this every single time a Democrat runs against a Republican?  I mean, with all the Soros money, they can pay off multitudes of women to come out and allege sexual harassment in all the 2018 races and beyond.  Wait. Let me fix that. They WILL pay off multitudes of women.  It's coming. And it will be every. single. race.  **What Didn't Work.**  We tried to red-pill all the people we could with facts that destroyed the harassment narrative the media was so willing to push as undeniable truth.  We pointed out the timing was suspect, being that it has been 40 years.  We showed them that Moore was her divorce judge several years earlier, yet no allegations came out then.  The forged yearbook--which was admitted to by the accuser--still didn't change minds.  In other words, disparaging the accuser doesn't work.  We can't attack the ""victims"" in these scenarios, even if they aren't truly the victims they claim they are. The general voting public still fell for the lies--as they seem to do much too frequently.  **What Will Work.**  First and foremost, the most powerful weapon against this kind of attack is the candidate themselves.  At EVERY opportunity, we need a **woman** to run!  Of course, we can't do this for every election, but wherever possible, this needs to happen.  This would make them powerless and it would be the strongest defense against this tactic.   Second, we need to get ahead of the game.  We need to surround each candidate by women supporters.  Flood the media with massively positive female perspective on the candidate.  This needs to happen the MOMENT someone is running...and anyone who is up for re-election needs to start this female media campaign NOW.  If each candidate can bring it up to the point where any accusations of the sort seem ludicrous, it will help dampen if not destroy the impact of false allegations.  And third, we need our candidates to take up women's issues in the strongest ways possible. Sure, attack Planned Parenthood but speak positively about the women's health facet and ONLY go after their abortion factory abattoir.  We know the equal pay position is based on fallacy, but promote and praise companies that pay women MORE (like the Trump Org. etc.).  Become an undeniable advocate for women.  I mean, we already are, but we need to make sure the media knows it and the voting public knows it.    Please submit your ideas below. We're making amazing progress in turning this country around and THIS is what they fear the most. If they can't attack our policies and positions, they WILL attack us personally. It's all they have.  And it's all they WILL have if we continue to MAGA.  Godspeed.   "

"Why doesn’t it seem like anyone is talking about this? The individual mandate was most legally controversial part of O care, and once the senate passes this Tax plan, it will be gone.

People freak out over net neutrality because it may give corporations too much power...  But it seems most are excited/applauding Disney buying Fox... I.e a monopoly.  Is this hypocritical or just me?

I can't remember the last time I got so much pleasure out of watching the news after Trump won the election. Watching their saltiness for the 2 or 3 days after the election was so glorious. I predict more salt tonight!

"Californian here, long time browser of the subreddit. First time posting here, but only because something amazing happened last night.  I have a girlfriend of 4 years, a beautiful and genuine girl, but a lifelong Democrat. She was all about Bernie around the 2016 election, and when he got duped, she moved right along to Hillary. We used to get in many arguments around the time of the election (and almost broke up multiple times) but she quickly realized she wasn't winning any of the arguments because she was simply regurgitating all she had heard.  For months her cognitive dissonance had become an obstacle, and we weren't able to talk about politics anymore. It was a shame. But in these past few months she has noticed some patterns.   I started pointing out the ironies in all of the ""social movements"" of the Democratic Party such as feminism, BLM, AntiFa, the entire MSM. She started wondering why not a single positive article has been written about Trump, even after I showed her that we hit 3% GDP, illegal immigration down 70%, unemployment at a 17 year low, etc etc etc. I then introduced her to The_Donald, which obviously made her deeply uncomfortable.  Net neutrality was the nail in the coffin. She is a film major, and knows all about the history of the telecommunications industry, and knows that the government handled the ""spectrum"" of radio in the same way they are treating net neutrality. She saw right through the government's bullshit, and noticed their ability to easily rile up EVERY one of our friends and associates. She noticed that people were being herded by the media, political hacks, and other big platforms.   She now researches her own information, browses T_D, has reinvigorated love for our flag, and told me this last night:  ""It sucks, realizing you have been lied to your entire life. I am glad I am doing my own research now, and refusing to be blind. It got tiring being mad all the time and the only thing I was able to do was point a finger at Trump.""  It was MUSIC TO MY EARS PEDES! Thank you for giving me the courage to talk to her about it! Thank you for the resources, and inspiration to tackle the hive mentality in people. God damn, I love this subreddit.   Everyone has the ability to critically think, its just a matter of using it. "
"While I can appreciate why everyone is concerned about Net Neutrality, I think the bigger picture is being missed. We are arguing a small fix to a much larger problem.   The reason NN policies were even put into place is because ISPs have monopolies over certain regions. The solution for consumers should be that if an ISP is behaving unethically, they should have the option to switch over to a competitor that does not engage in these activities. Encouraging competition and the formation of new ISPs would solve this problem.   It's as if we are trying to save people from a burning building and debating who is going to save them, instead of asking why there is a fire in the first place.  Will ShariaBlue still downvote? Yes."
"[Luke 1:57-66 KJV] Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.   And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.   And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.   And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him."

And the evening and the morning were the second day."
"am i the only person who found it odd; as soon as trump was elected and sworn into office, 3 massive hurricanes and weather that's been off the charts for a few years now has reverted back to the norm???.... as crazy as it sounds, weather changing programs are a thing... what if obama and the fuckers were trying to cause global weather unrest to push the bullshit global warming narrative.. and trump just stopped it? he did tell alex jones he'll be pleased with him on that topic during an interview. anyway theres no evidence on any of this, just a random thought i had today and was wondering if anyone felt the same.

"Here is a showerthought I've been having for the past 2 weeks about net neutrality, and I'd like to share it with TD:  When you get to the absolute core with Net Neutrality, it shifts power away from internet service providers (the corporations that build the data trunks in the US) to Content Distribution Networks, such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), Netflix, and other companies that manage servers, but not data trunks (although Google did have Google Fiber, they've ceased expanding it due to cost, which is ironic).  This significant shift saves these companies huge amounts of money, as ISPs can no longer charge them for prioritizing their services, despite just [3 websites](http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-bandwidth-share-2016-1201801064/) (YouTube.com, Netflix.com, and Amazon Prime VOD) taking up 60% of all of America's bandwidth.   So how can these companies pay back the benevolent governmental administration that stacked the deck in their favor?  By doing the thing inverse of neutrality: Censoring content.   Think about the kind of power companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix posses in terms of shaping content. Imagine a political administration that grants them a sizable financial favor - absolving them of having to pay the people that lay the data networks for them.  And that, my friends, is why they don't want to give up net neutrality. "

A 90 Day Ban was actually pretty reasonable. 90 Days to get the Governments shit together before letting people in. Perhaps we should be thanking the Liberal Judges. Because of them America has only had a few minor incidents regarding terrorist connected individuals committing attacks. Any Judge knows that what Trump did was perfectly within his rights as Commander and Chief with that EO. And every time a 9th Circuit Lower Court Judge Blocks the Ban that 90 day ban just gets restarted from Day 1.

To promote marriage and societial childbirth reproduction and survival its time to federally deregulate state by state divorce and alimonies so people arent scared of it. End the endless trials and evaluations and have a simply low cost system like denmark. Do it on federal civil rights basis.  People are avoiding child birth and marriage because they know if it goes wrong their lives are ruined by endless court and legal expenses and unquantifiable childcare costs and spousal support.  If people knew spousal support was not a requirement and child care costs would be strictly limited to actual reasonable cost splitting then  they woukdnt be so scared of marriage and having children with someone else.  No person should ever be required to pay for the lifestyle of another adult person. Thats slavery. Spousal support should be ended on federal civil rights grounds.   Then more people will be happier to try marriage and have kids.

"This over-50 actor has been around forever and has appeared in some of your favorite films. He has slowed his roll a bit, but he was quite the skirt chaser back in his younger days.  Some those skirts did not want to be chased.  His partner is now bracing herself.  She has told friends that even though he has never admitted to anything, she has heard whispers of him forcing women to do things they didn’t want to do back in the day. She is afraid to confront him. She does not know if his name comes up if she should defend him or stay quiet or leave him or what. The uncertainty is killing her.

Anyone else think we need a dating site explicitly for Trump supporters? I’m tired of going out with women who claim to be conservative but then freak out when they discover I support the president.
They’re whining about Trump not having a press conference after signing the tax bill and trying to suggest that a “backlog of bad news” is piling up. And now they’re salivating over muh Russia again. Why is CNN shown in airports? I don’t need fake news while I wait for my flight.

"I was out on a first date with a woman who turned out to be MUCH better looking than her pics. My mind was blown. We had been texting for a while and much to my amazement, she hadn't brought up politics - seriously, Im a little sick of political talk invading every aspect of life. I do post a lot on T_D but this is where I come to bask in GEOTUS glory, not argue with shills or deal with nut jobs.   Anyways, so keep in mind, me and the woman are both Indian (like the username?). I forgot how, but she begins to complain about Trump supporters and then said ""can you believe there are Indian trump supporters?!""   I turned to her with a raised eyebrow.  Her eyes widened, her jaw dropped and she remarked, ""NO!!!"" You're not one of them!""  Me: Does that mean we're not going to have sex? Her: But but why do you like him? Me: Can we just enjoy this date without politics? I was rather impressed you hadn't brought up politics.  Her: No no I need to know. Me: Oh, Im pretty much on board with his entire agenda.   So she proceeds to detail how NN is going to destroy the public school system, take away the internet from the poor, etc. This goes on for a while. Im just enjoying some corn bread while she 'explains' how poor people will be stuck with AOL and emails and unable to afford YouTube (I did inquire as to whether porn would still be available for the huddled masses - she wasn't sure).   I then asked her if she realized that this BS concept of NN wasn't into effect prior to 2015, and none of what she said was the case. She insisted there were other rules stopping all those horrible things from happening.  Me: Can you tell me those rules? Her: Well...not right now. Me: Not one? Her: No.... Me: So you don't even know if you're telling me an accurate statement. Her: .....that's a good point.  We proceeded to enjoy the rest of our date. We kissed, I dropped her off and she wishes to see me again.   "

Today a cowoker showed me LBRY, which is meant to be a decentralized image/video sharing service. No one can take this shit down, tipping is integrated, and 100% of earnings go to the creator.

"Hey T_D, Merry Christmas to everyone!  I want to say a special thank you to those whom I have talked to already and helping spread the word. The greatest part of next year is what POTUS delivered to me as a small business owner.  I have run a web site for many years and branched out this year to physical goods and will grow next year due to the tremendous tax cuts we all got as Christmas presents. I will be able to hire some help and continue to grow!  This is the greatest gift of all. Not only can I build a business around my favorite subject, the Second Amendment, but I can thrive in it and produce jobs for folks that maybe didn't have one.  2017 was a hard year on a lot of us. We went through hurricane Irma, lost some stuff and I lost a couple people who had no choice but to move away afterwards.   2018 will bring a lot of good and positive change. I'm moving the business to Texas and will expand. We are even looking into a store front for the first time. Very exciting things indeed. You will be able to find me near Lake Livingston and I am always looking forward to meeting new Centipede friends!   If you care at all about the Second Amendment, feel free to check out https://reloadone.com (2A magazine) and my new business https://armsetc.com (custom frames: https://imgur.com/6Qmnz1S) and consider helping make 2018 YUGE!  But most of all, thank you to POTUS for making all of this possible. Without those tax cuts, none of this would have been possible.  Merry Christmas Everyone!"

Unemployment is at a record low, home construction is at a decades high, African-American unemployment is at a 17-year low, Hispanic unemployment is at a record low.""

"Interesting info from betting aggregation site www.oddschecker.com/politics/us-politics/us-presidential-election-2020/winner, which puts up the odds from 20 different actual betting sites.  The current odds, based on actual bets, for President Trump to be reelected to a second term are are from 40 to 50 percent depending on the site.  Whereas the odds for Hillary are from 2 to 3 percent, and her odds are far surpassed by political nonentities such as Dwayne Johnson, Mark Zuckerberg, Cory Booker, Amy Clobuchar and Doug Jones.  Only yesterday, Christmas Day, there was a fawning, obviously scripted interview with Hillary conducted by - get this - Steve Harvey.  The audience was obviously hand picked also, they applauded and cheered loudly at everything she said, no matter how inane.  If HRC had said ""In order to save our democracy we need to neuter all white males, and then take away their right to vote!"", they would have applauded that as well.  So why do the fake news media keep pushing Hillary?"

He wont nominate a conservative to the supreme court. He wont withdraw from TPP. He wont withdraw from Paris. He won't be able to stop illegal immigration.  3% growth is impossible. He wont get funding for the wall. Manufacturing will never come back. He won't actually deregulate.  He'll never get tax cuts passed. He won't actually move the US embassy to Jerusalem.

Anyways I felt so relaxed and so at ease to be spending my Christmas with my parents and this discussion around the table was not loud and rowdy. I think it was my parents who shaped my core political values. Good people in my life. Quite apparent that I may be one of the few in my family who hold conservative views. Could explain why I don't receive much correspondences from my cousins who tend to lean left. That bothers me and despite that, they cannot be civil. I have not talked to many of them in years. I never see them. Lost cause I guess. Either way I sent them Christmas cards. All I can do I guess.  "
"As I watch what little coverage there is of the current Iranian attempts to throw off their oppressive government I can't help but remember sitting glued to the TV in 1989 watching practically non-stop coverage on the Tienanmen Square uprising , especially on CNN, at a time when there was no internet to speak of and video was allegedly being smuggled out via what was then relatively new DVD-R technology...  we all hoped that perhaps this would be the beginning of the end for Communism as a major force in world politics, were shown compelling photos of one solitary individual standing up to a brutal military regime that inspired solidarity among people who value liberty the world over, had our hopes buoyed as anchors and reporters expressed their belief that this time was different and had hopes of toppling the regime...   but instead of that spirit prevailing the attempted revolt was crushed and after that the coverage practically ceased and the liberal idea that people being liberated from that kind of oppression was important seems to have been shelved and the MSM became more interested in attacking people who stir up trouble by pointing out that these abusive governments still exist, and with normalizing that oppression under the guise of ""globalism"".  Now with nearly 30 years of hindsight to work with, I have to wonder if the very thorough Tianamen Square coverage wasn't just another coordinated MSM/globalist propaganda job designed to illustrate to not just the Chinese but the world at large that resistance to that kind of collectivist governmental control is futile.  Before the last few years I would have said that this was a pretty far-fetched conspiracy theory, but not with what I know now about globalists and the news media that serves them."
"Because Pelosi has a point.

Definition of Obstructionism.  So just ban the Democrats and streamline the process.  Anything wrong with this approach as a practical issue?  spez: Obviously the ""shut down the government"" vote is her being spiteful, but we should run with the opening she's given us.

"The revised tax bill has dropped its support for Nuclear Power tax credits  https://www.oilandgas360.com/incentives-for-evs-and-wind-make-it-into-final-tax-bill-nuclear-credits-canned/  Even when wind and electric vehicles make it on the bill. I think this is a mistake, as nuclear power is our most powerful green energy source, and one that doesn't falter like wind or solar.   The good news is that effort is continuing to introduce tax credits at a later date  https://www.eenews.net/eedaily/2017/12/21/stories/1060069617  http://www.myajc.com/news/isakson-projects-confidence-about-congress-quickly-approving-vogtle-money/fNPeVWPrUVV0bYbG0o6mYN/  Right now it's mainly focused on the 2 US nuclear plants in construction right now, but a nuclear tax credit could help construction of future advanced nuclear reactors which are much easier to produce, cheaper, and safer.  I hope nuclear gets the relief it deserves. Congrats on the rest of the tax bill by the way!"
"In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is.    The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence."

Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email. ​ .   I cannot state how huge this is, it's a cover-up involving the President of the United States. There are a lot of emails implying this, but this email states it very clearly so anyone can understand.  The email proves obstruction of justice and shows how they lied to the FBI, and likely perjury of Congress. This at the very least proves intent by her Chief of Staff. Obama used executive privilege in their correspondence. Cheryl Mills (who was given immunity) states they need to ""clean up"" the Clinton/Obama e-mails because they lacked state.gov.  Additionally, Obama on video [publicly denied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnIA0QJWqEI) knowing about the server. He also [claimed on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxnFoFOyn48) that he learned about the secret server through the news like everyone else. The corruption goes all the way to the top! Obama is lying to the American public. Hillary Clinton set up her private server to hide her pay to play deals discovered throughout these leaks, and to prevent FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests.  Paul Combetta was hired to modify the email headers that referred to a VERY VERY VIP individual, i.e. change the name of who it was from. If you [read Stonetear/Combetta story](http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/22/how-reddit-ruined-the-hillary-clinton-campaign/), it's easy to see this is exactly what he was attempting. He wanted to change header information on already sent mail to show ""state.gov"" instead of Hillary's private email address. Multiple people informed him of the infeasibility (and illegality) of it, so somewhere in the next 6 days, it was decided that simply eradicating them was the only option left. The FBI said they could find no intent to break the law, therefore no recommendation of prosecution.  This email proves, in plain language, that there was intention, and knowingly broke the law. Ask yourselves: Why would they both be communicating on a secret server to each other? Why not through normal proper channels? What were they hiding? We may soon find out. .

We are going to take the white mans life.""   &gt; ""You have to move on the white even if it means violence and bloodshed.""   &gt; ""Your first job is to kill Jesus and the other honkies will fall into line. Then the white man dies. ""   The FBI's summary about Kwanzaa founder Maulana Karenga is this:   &gt; On close examination, the teachings and preaching of Karenga and his ilk are baseless and destructive. ""The Quotable Karenga"", is wildly destructive and is an assault upon the intelligence of all American Negroes.   You can read the FBI file on the founder of Kwanzaa here: http://governmentattic.org/docs/FBI_Monograph_US_April-1968.pdf  I am a pro whatever race you are person. If youre black be proud to be black. If youre Italian be proud of it. If youre Chinese love your race. If youre Polish like I am, enjoy the jokes ;) All together we make up an incredible and amazing world that we all call home.   What the world DOES NOT need are people like Maulana Karenga (aka Ronie McKinley) dividing everyone with faux celebrations born from hate. How is he able to operate all these years without any scrutiny?"
if I listened to Eichenwald's shitty advice last year.
"I have seen numerous posts from pedes looking for work, some homeless .  We are a community and only as good as our weakest link. So first challenge, I have a pede in tempe/scottsdale az, who is looking for any kind of work.  Who has leads for this pede?  "
"Had a post about tipping my Pizza Gal 20 bucks and a merry Christmas, didnt think much of it never saw any replies but when i checked the post I had seveal but no trace of them on my dashboard"

Damn straight.
"Do you people not realize that other cultures celebrate the new year on a different date? No you don’t. Do you Nazis know that the Chinese celebrate the New Year on February the 18th? No, you don’t because you are all a bunch of Nazis that only care about the white-cultured new year calendar called the Gregorian Calendar. As a Hispanic and as someone who uses the Aztec Calendar on a regular basis, the new year already happened many moons ago and he did not acknowledge the fact. I have never been more reeeeefended in my entire life. Donald Turnip does not acknowledge other calendars. Literally Hitler.   **END RANT**   /s"

I've been looking all day and can't find it. Please help and thank you! 
"Through Smile.Amazon. That way when you buy a Trump hat to replace the one that keeps getting stolen, you will automatically donate too the people who are supporting us. "

"I listen to the ONLY conservative talk station in the San Francisco Bay Area, KSFO 560AM, and yesterday, they had the BEST morning segment. ( you can get it for free on iHeartRadio)  The station asked conservative / Trump supporting listeners who work in Silly Con valley to call in.  The topic was the bias of libtardation in the valley, and the melting snowflakes the day after the election.  One caller, admitted she ( not zhe ) worked at the Gulagplex. She said the day after the election, all the libfarts wore BLACK clothing to work.. because they were in MOURNING for hillarie’s loss in the election.  ��  Additionally, I know from other sources  ( have to protect them ) , Goog ( Alphabet ) held talk sessions, where employees could grab a mic and share their feelings about the loss... many of them stood up and CRIED publicly in front of their peers....  including grown ass men!   That is all."
"Per article: But later, Kennedy said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission seemed “neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips’ religious beliefs” when it found his refusal to bake a cake for the gay couple violated the state’s anti-discrimination law."
Hitler would never declare the capital of Israel Jerusalem. He would never recognize Israel as a nation. The Lefts favorite insult no longer applies to President Trump.

"If Comcast and AT&amp;T can bring the tech giants down a notch, I'm all for it. All this time we've been plotting on ways to take down monopolies who have waged war against us and our beliefs and the solution might've been in front of us all along.  While I doubt it will ever get to what the neuteureds think will happen, I'll gladly cheer on Comcast and AT&amp;T if they wage war against the tech giants."

"Muh Brobama came into my room to bring me a plate of magic wands and I literally screamed at him and hit the plate of magic wands out of his hand. He started yelling and swearing that Trump’s 4% growth and the Dow rising 5000 points in a year for the first time ever was all due to him and I slammed the door on him. I’m so distressed right now I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to do that to my BroBama but I’m literally in shock from the GDP tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is the economy breaking records? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown. I don’t want to believe the world is so great with Trump. I want a future to believe in. I want less than 3% GDP and higher taxes to break this country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, I thought Trump needed a magic wand and he would never bring jobs back???? This is so fucked."
If a court finds you not guilty that means you’re innocent and didn’t actually do a terrible thing!   Serious? People didn’t realize I was mocking liberals? Not sure who to make fun of here.

"Calling someone Pocahontas is not racism.

It's ridicule, and its well placed.  She touted that she was Native American to gain tenure at Harvard.  Harvard even claimed, ""EW is the first minority to gain tenure.""  What does that do for actual people who are real minorities?  In 2012 when she ran for Senate she claimed that she didn't understand why Harvard listed her as a minority, knowing damn well that she listed it.  She is a joke.

You are big supporters of the LGBT community, no issue there, but you LOVE Islam. Who just so happens to murder gay men and women for the sole reason of being gay. You have a group called Antifa that goes around beating the shit out of anyone who doesn't agree with them. That resembles the Hitler Youth much more than any Trump supporters. We don't support a traitor, or a man who didn't have a real job until he was 40 who's trying to steal from hard working Americans to implement socialism that never works. Ask Venezuela.

Luckily they are still thousands of young women here in the United States who dress properly in skirts/dresses,support trump,are beautiful,intelligent,and know they already have rights, there numbers are only gonna grow, as a Gen Z millennial it relieves me to know that I am able to get married someday if I want to and not worry about SJWs being the only women in America.

I don't think you're American. I don't think you're worthy of even being called a human. You're nothing but filthy, jobless, communist rats.  *'muh ricochet bullet'* is a bullshit excuse. The fact that you're favoring an illegal alien (who was deported SEVEN TIMES) over one of our American citizens says enough.  If I see an illegal, and I know he/she's an illegal, I WILL call ICE without hesitation. Their very existence within our borders is a slap in the face of many **LEGAL**, **HARDWORKING**, **PATRIOTIC** immigrants (including myself) who put their blood, sweat, and tears into building a future for themselves in this country, as well as it is an insult to **all other Americans who are struggling** while these illegal parasites *get everything for free*.

"I won’t link to the thread directly, but it explicitly states that Pai is “speaking at Verizon headquarters” and links the following url (currently loading slow under heavy traffic)  http://www.iicom.org/events/telecommunications-and-media-forum/item/tmf-washington-2017  Here we see a conference for an **industry group** in **Washington, DC.** Verizon is listed as a sponsor for the event (they do work in the telco industry after all), but it is explicitly not located at Verizon headquarters, nor it is a private event for Verizon. I would expect the FCC Chairman to speak at events like this. Much different than the implication that he is doing some shadowy, private speech to a corporate overlord. Looking at the comments I can’t find a single correction to this glaring mistake.   Just another example of fake news that gets a free pass on this website. "

If my powerBI dashboard had hung like that, it could have been because someone was running a big update statement, changing the data in the underlying tables.      In order to find out, someone needs to check the transaction logs on all of the databases: AP's and the polling booths.     This has to be done fast. Transaction logs aren't normally kept for more than a few days, and probably aren't covered in that court order."
"[Matthew 2:1-11 KJV] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.   When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.   Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.   When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."

Reminder that Obama's birth certificate as he posted on official government websites was proved beyond a shadow of a doubt to be forged using  cut and pasted dates from another woman's birth certificate and Obama was likely not actually legally a president and Trump was defending the nation against a literal foreign agent posing as President.

"I think Roy Moore probably dated younger women. To the point where we frown upon a 32 year old dating a 17/18 year old. But it isn't illegal, just frowned upon. The RINOs and the Left could hurt Roy Moore with this. But these claims are 39 years ago and not illegal. Maybe Roy would have come up to the podium to explain this embarrassing but not illegal act. But no....  ...the Left and the RINOs had to find  something illegal. If they could place Moore with a 17 or 18 year old than it wouldn't be too hard to convince the public to make a leap to a 14 year old. Bam! Illegal! So that's when the WaPo at the behest of the DNC cooked up the Leigh Corfman scam with Gloria Allred and the fake signature.  When Roy saw this concocted story to take him down, he did the right move to deny all accusations. If the Left wants to play hardball then Roy Moore is going to play. That's what the media does, blends truth with lies to try and muddy things up."

Nothing he has ever done even slightly compares to the Clintons. If there was anything, we'd know by now.   By their logic, if posting fake news on the internet is rigging an election, ShariaBlue was an attempt to rig the election. They say we live in a globalist society where everyone is the same, so does it matter there they were located?  PissGate is evidence that the Clintons were working with the Russians, so why don't they care about that? No, they'd still rather have a person that: 1. Supports a rapist 2. Murders enemies 3.

"So my wife is a witness in a DUI hit-and-run in VA and the court case record lists the defendant as “non-Hispanic Caucasian.”  Now even the most sensitive lib would say this guy isn’t Caucasian. For example, he needed an interpreter at his pre-trial hearing, his name is 100% Hispanic, and his family is all Hispanic.  The only reason I can think for them to not list his race is to skew crime data (which we know they are trying to cover-up Re: California and Sweden).  “Oh look, we don’t have an illegal immigrant crime problem!”  “Look, most of the DUIs are white males!”  We can’t even trust pure data anymore!  Rogue employee or our corrupt governor?  The swamp extends far and wide. "
"I've been extremely happy with everything Trump has done so far, except one thing: I was worried that the Swamp may not be drained or that Justice may not be served.

This was a total disregard for evidence. A gun cannot shoot off by stepping on it. The guilty defendant admitted to the gun going off and is caught on video running away. He’s clearly lying about the gun “being stepped on and discharging” but even if the jury believes that trash he at least gets charged with manslaughter. Our justice system failed in the name of political correctness and California being what California has always been.

We know, for sure, that John Podesta is the main mind behind the Russia collusion narrative (see [the timeline I developed a few months ago as the first of the information became public](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/633nd8/important_pedes_i_have_put_together_the_russia/), also from what was made public in *Shattered*).  The thing I don't quite see yet is how one FBI agent, apparently, managed to steer the government's investigation into supposed ""Russian collusion"" by doing two things - softening the charges associated with Clinton in the first place (and meddling with the interview process for other witnesses), and preventing the new batch of emails from Wiener's hard drive from being properly investigated.  I see, logically, three possibilities:  *  One, that Strzok was acting totally independently of Podesta's circle, and decided to meddle out of a personal like for Clinton.  *  Two, that Strzok was influenced by Podesta's propaganda machine and decided to help exonerate Clinton in order to help her win.  *  Three, that Strzok was actively working with Podesta (or someone in Podesta's circle) as Clinton's man on the inside, and helped to exonerate Clinton because of that personal connection.  Open to interpretation if Podesta reached out to Strzok, or vice versa.  I don't know what to make of it, but I don't believe in coincidences - how likely is it that someone acting independently steers the government in the same direction Podesta took the social sphere after the election?"

This is a dangerous power MSM have now realized they all have-their fake Russia news can make markets crash. There must be consequences not just firing (which they haven't even done).
"WASHINGTON — Ringing in the holidays for the first time from Washington, President Donald Trump lit the National Christmas Tree Thursday evening, wishing the country “a Merry Christmas” — as he vowed to do during his campaign.  Taking part in the annual ritual, Trump counted down from 10 before his wife, Melania, pushed a button to set the tree aglow with golden lights and silver stars.  “Today’s a day that I’ve been looking very much forward to all year long,” said Trump. “And now, as the president of the United States, it’s my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world a very merry Christmas.”  During his campaign, Trump had promised that, when he was elected, people would be saying “Merry Christmas again,” a reference to what he characterized as the country’s obsession with political correctness. In Trump’s view, the move toward the use of the more inclusive phrase “Happy holidays” minimized the Christian celebration.  Trump was introduced by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who called Trump “a man who loves our parks, loves our military, and loves our country. The man who brought ‘Merry Christmas’ back to our nation’s capital — and you did, sir.”  Speaking from behind a bullet-proof glass enclosure, Trump also bragged about the mild weather, which hovered in the mid-50s, and compared himself to President Ulysses S. Grant, who signed legislation making Christmas a federal holiday.  “I sort of feel we’re doing that again,” he said to an audience that included many of his family members.  The program, which will air Monday on the Hallmark Channel, was hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and actor Dean Cain and featured performances by the Beach Boys, Jack Wagner, Wynonna Judd, Craig Campbell and others. It was a less high-profile lineup than last year, when the performers included Kelly Clarkson, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, The Lumineers, James Taylor and Chance the Rapper.  This year marks the 95th annual National Christmas Tree Lighting. The tradition began in 1923 with President Calvin Coolidge and takes place in President’s Park, just south of the White House."
"Flynn tells a lie to FBI about a non-crime.  The Left goes nuts and screams and crys to prosecute him.  DOJ opens investigation and prosecutes.   The Left celebrates and parades about justice for lying to FBI regardless of reason.   Trump pardons Flynn.  DOJ  then investigates Hillary, Comey, Rice, etc. for the many lies they told to cover up their own crimes.  The Left crys foul,  but DOJ reminds how Flynn was prosecuted for MUCH less.  Dominos start to fall and the hypocrisy of the left is exposed  (yet again)  "
People getting wise?
"""The shift from ""grossly negligent"" to ""extremely careless,"" which may appear pedestrian at first glance, reflected a decision by the FBI that could have had potentially significant legal implications, as the federal law governing the mishandling of classified material establishes criminal penalties for ""gross negligence.""

"I don't understand all the calls for Sessions to be fired.  I mean I can...but only to people who don't see past the show to see the man behind the curtain.  .   Trump cannot go after his political adversaries. It is bad PR. It will only lead to vast civil unrest across the country. It especially gives Soros' army, antifa, and all the other psycho liberals the most opportune reason to raze the cities. I can see already see the headlines.   .  In order to go after the Deep State, Trump needs to look like he is totally hands off. That is what I see every time he tweets something about the DoJ being quiet and not doing anything. With every tweet he is pushing himself further and further away from the DoJ. When indictments do start to drop, it looks like a totally independent DoJ investigation that Trump had no hand in. The best case scenario is every department cleans itself up without Trump giving a single command.  .   Go watch that session where Sessions answers questions to the house a month or two ago. There were a few tells that he is working on stuff that he can't discuss.  .   The second problem: you have to deprogram the (leftist) population. Trump could go through and wipe out the Deep State in one fell swoop. That's good....but you still have a large share of the population who have been programmed with crazy leftist ideology and conspiracy theories. Hence the immediate riots and civil unrest that would occur. My theory is that he is trying to win people over (no matter how futile) via his success, or perhaps wait until people get exhausted from the Trump Derangement Syndrome and get on to the acceptance phase like the R's did with Berry....then start to knock down the big dominoes after flushing out the small fish in the meantime.

"Seriously.... you even have local tv anchors parroting leftist talking points on this issue.  Cui Bono?  The internet destroyed traditional mainstream media’s ability to act as a gatekeeper. I remember back in 2006,2007 when they were against it or didn’t have such favorable coverage.  Now Morning show hosts are parroting the leftist talking points about this without so much as giving conservatives their side of the story?  Does a host of The Today Show really know anything about this issue?  Who benefits from Net Neutrality — as it is described by the left?  Huffingtonpost, Breitbart, alex jones, any independent media ran strictly off the internet?  Who loses? NBC, abc, cnn—any traditional outlet who used to be able to act as a gatekeeper for how News was shaped and disseminated.  I’ve followed this issue for the last 12 years and I just find it extremely funny how the establishment seems to be totally for this when they were totally against it. Back in 2007—it was mainly the Valley and tech companies being the fierce advocates for it. Now news agencies are for it? Something doesn’t smell right "
"Donald Trump is embarked on a very difficult path. In a world where America is the role model for capitalism (forget China. It cannot replace the US as it essentially relies on the US as a role model.), lazy liberalism poses a serious risk to us all in its inability to manage capitalism efficiently. Social relations in capitalism MUST be dedicated to it alone. We cannot water it down with Arab culture (Islam) and countries must learn how to play the game. They cannot simply hoick their surplus population across borders. The only way to do that is through the market and the harsh lessons market forces will teach us all."

"X-post from r TheRedPill Thank you -pushkin for this wonderful post.   TL;DR in The Roman Empire : Peace caused Feminism, Feminism and its values caused very low fertility rates + virility drop among men ( they became more and more weak fat apathetic, homosexuality and prostitution became normal ), it resulted in a massive immigration to sustain demography and to do the dirty jobs romans didn't want to do anymore. A new religion came in and grew in followers very quickly. Government public debt skyrocketted. Politics went nuts, leaders were either hated or puppets. Most of the army was made of mercenaries ( paid immigrants because romans didn't want the dirty job anymore ). Romans were about to become a minority in Rome. Mercenaries eventually overran and pillaged the Empire.   My personal theory is this : if a country's fertility rate per woman goes below 2 for a considerable amount of time, it will end in an economical and political crisis. If that country uses immigration to sustain demography, it will end in a civil war.   Edit : I said feminism causes economical crisis... but why ? Someone linked a very nice video explaining a very plausible theory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__PJ8ymliw  Please note that I didn't write any of the following text, it is a comment u / tomek77 / made 7 years ago on r / Equality / making observations about how we're following the same path as the roman empire . It ultimately led me to believe that the western part of the world will pretty much cease to exist in the next 50 years.   ────────  Unfortunately, feminism and future is an oxymoron (or fortunately, depending on your point-of-view), as it seems to be unsustainable on the long run.  Based on past history, it appears that a civilization that embraces feminist values will cease to exist in just a few centuries. This is why we have never seen a feminist civilization aside from very short spans at the end of the Roman empire and possibly a few other more ancient civilizations.  Reading the history of the roman Empire brings such glaring similarities with our own civilization, it is as if human social dynamics are literally stuck in a cycle that repeats every couple thousand years (there were two matriarchical, extremely advanced civilizations: one at the end of the Roman empire, 2000 years ago, one possibly at the end of Babylon, 4000 years ago).  For those who enjoy history, here is a short recap of social changes in Rome, 2 millenia ago (most historians focus on military and political facts, but I find the social aspects just as fascinating):   • ~5 century BC: Roman civilization is a a strong patriarchy, fathers are liable for the actions of their wife and children, and have absolute authority over the family (including the power of life and death)   • ~1 century BC: Roman civilization blossoms into the most powerful and advanced civilization in the world. Material wealth is astounding, citizens (i.e.: non slaves) do not need to work. They have running water, baths and import spices from thousands of miles away. The Romans enjoy the arts and philosophy; they know and appreciate democracy, commerce, science, human rights, animal rights, children rights and women become emancipated. No-fault divorce is enacted, and quickly becomes popular by the end of the century.   • ~1-2 century AD: The family unit is destroyed. Men refuse to marry and the government tries to revive marriage with a ""bachelor tax"", to no avail. Children are growing up without fathers, Roman women show little interest in raising their own children and frequently use nannies. The wealth and power of women grows very fast, while men become increasingly demotivated and engage in prostitution and vice. Prostitution and homosexuality become widespread.   • ~3-4 century AD: A moral and demographic collapse takes place, Roman population declines due to below-replacement birth-rate. Vice and massive corruption are rampant, while the new-born Catholic Religion is gaining power (it becomes the religion of the Empire in 380 AD). There is extreme economic, political and military instability: there are 25 successive emperors in half a century (many end up assassinated), the Empire is ungovernable and on the brink of civil war.   • ~5 century AD: The Empire is ruled by an elite of military men that use the Emperor as a puppet; due to massive debts and financial problems, the Empire cannot afford to hire foreign mercenaries to defend itself (Roman citizens have long ago being replaced by mercenaries in the army), and starts ""selling"" parts of the Empire in exchange for protection. Eventually, the mercenaries figure out that the ""Emperor has no clothes"", and overrun and pillage the Empire.   • humanity falls back into the Bronze Age (think: eating squirrel meat and living in a cave); 12 centuries of religious zilotry (The Great Inquisition, Crusades) and intellectual darkness follow: science, commerce, philosophy, human rights become unknown concepts until they are rediscovered again during the Age of Enlightenment in 17th century AD.  Regarding the Babylonian civilization (~2,000 BC), we have relatively few records, but we do know that they had a very advanced civilization because we found their legislative code written down on stone tablets (yes, they had laws and tribunals, and some of today's commercial code can even be traced back to Babylonian law). They had child support laws (which seems to indicate that there was a family breakdown), and they collapsed presumably due to a ""moral breakdown"" figuratively represented in the Bible as the ""Tower of Babel"" (which was inspired by a real tower). Interesting and controversial anecdote: some claim that the Roman Catholic Religion is nothing more than a rewriting and adaptation of an ancient Babylonian religion!"

"By the time 2020 rolls around, and at the rate he is fulfilling promises, Trump won't have any issues to campaign on. He will have fixed the country entirely. He is too motivated to just sit in the Oval Office doing nothing for four more years, so I predict he'll go find another project.   Our only hope of 8 total years of GEOTUS is if he purposefully puts off fulfilling his campaign promises and fixing things, so he has stuff to do in his second term. Kind of like a TV show that stretches the plot out because they have more episodes to fulfill than they have story for. But Trump is way too driven to stoop to tactics like that."
"Honestly the backwater political message boards have become your best source, T_D included. Pretty much anything in the spotlight of ""media"" is either already bought out, in the process of being bought out, or will eventually be bought out.   Media is a precious commodity, especially to those with an agenda to push that is counter to the silent majority. It's the bullhorn they need to REEEEEEE loud enough to drown out the electrician who wants to talk for five minutes at a town hall about building code. It's the platform they need to REEEEEEE loud enough to silence a doctor expressing concern over something related to public health. It's the machine they need to roll over and crush the policeman who wants to tell his story about positive interaction with the public. It's the propaganda they require to assume control over an entire society. It's one of the keystone tenants of communism, which has invaded and begun to pervert our nation like a gangrenous infection.   So even though we still have some conservative leaning news/media outlets, it's only a matter of time before they're infiltrated and bought out. That's the methodology of the communist agents that have been silently and slowly attacking our nation from within for the past 30 years. Hell they even spell it out in the communist manifesto.   One huge problem is that the communists of today are a weird hybridization of communists and opportunistic oligarchs. Their utopia of the Soviet Union collapsed while they were overseas, on the job, so now they have no home unit, and have largely become rogue agents that will continue to subvert our society not for loyalty to their soviet comrades, but for personal gain and profit.   They use the methods and tools that were given to them in the 80's to prop up a system that breeds followers and puts money into their coffers.   Communism is a system of control over the masses. And if you can control enough of the masses to consume your content, then the money prints itself.   We just need some brilliant anonfag over at /pol/ to occasionally drive a van at full speed up a ramp and through a flaming circle while tossing out leaked documents into the crowd that unveils the masters, not because they're some political wizard - no, it's much more simple than that - those bastards are just in it all for the lols and to counter whatever is the mainstream culture, so they'll slam the gas pedal into the floor and flip that motherfucker while holding onto the oh-shit-handle with one hand, and doing the pepe gesture with the other, ***just because they can***.   It's fucking weird, hilarious and even sad that our society has become this illusion of freedom of ideas, when in reality basically everything we consume is in some way tied to the media overlords and their trickery, who occasionally get their balls busted by some faggot on the internet who is so disillusioned with society that they've made a pastime out of ruining globalists' day.

"I recently deleted links to several website that I have frequented for nearly ten years.  Why? Because after reading a story or a comment I believed in exercising my 1st amendment right.  However, over the last 12 months sites like DisQus, have been employing heavy handed censorship actions to conservatives. Also some of the ""moderators"" take the any pro-Trump post personally and suspend, block or banish posters.    Why not reason with them?  When you attempt to reason with a communist moderator, you are met with mockery or scoffing. They genuinely don't care about free speech and are happy to tell you so. In their small dual synapse minds, the only thing that matters is that America and President Trump are the enemy, anyone who supports either is a Nazi, and if they are white, then they are double Nazis.  It is insane the time we are living in. A time when free thought, expression or curiosity is punished; hate crime 20 year sentence for a ""fooking white male"" leaving bacon on a ""Religion of Hates"" doorstep in Florida. We have crossed over into a dark realm of pseudo communism that will either lead to full blown communism or full blown civil war.   How did we get here?  Opinions are like a holes, but this man's opinion it is this, patriotic free speech has been driven from our lands and patriots have no avenues to express their disgust at the communist leanings of the American left. When you take away free thought, expression and speech from a people accustomed to it, then you must be ready to accept the harsh outcomes that follow.  What can be done to change the inevitable?   Websites need to allow for the expression of thought, if not then they are part and parcel of the end of America. People need to learn how to disagree with one another and remain civil.  The people need to take control of the government, before it takes the rest of our Liberty. Pray for Our country and each other and that God keeps blessing us.  #MAGA,  The Real Chipster"

"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries, improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.  A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.  Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.  -Winston Churchill"
"I was answering someone who replied to something I wrote about the ""left"" side of our UNIPARTY system. A few thoughts later, I thought how the repubs act on solid fact and with rationality (sort of). The dems act totally it seems on emotion and bitter diatribe, don't forget outright lies. So that being said, its almost like the Uniparty resembles the human brain. The right is the rational/analytic side and the left is the emotional side.

"“With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people—a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and independence.“ -John Jay  Been reading through the Federalist Papers and essay #2 is where I found this gem. This is not to say that other people wouldn’t be welcome, but that our founding fathers knew that we shared a culture, shared values. We fought for that culture, and we won. Any attempt to dilute American values and culture, eroding what our founders fought, bled, and died for is a slap in the face to their sacrifice.   REMEMBER WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR PEDES!  MAGA!"
"I watched the FBI hearing right after Comey was fired and McCabe sure as shit didn’t seem upset that Comey was gone. He was almost giddy about it. He knew that Comey was going to be canned by Hillary because he just didn’t suck up hard enough. Clinton still blames Comey for her loss. McCabe was already getting campaign cash from Clinton for his wife and he’s got his own sexual harassment claims that would probably disappear if Clinton was president (it’s almost like you have to be perverted to be in her camp). Anyway, this same douche put his pro-Clinton protege in charge of the Clinton and Trump/Russia investigations, knowing the investigations would be biased.   You might wonder why he’s still doing shit Hillary would want even though Hillary lost? The answer is simple. He thinks that if Trump is gone then a DNC president will be in charge soon and that he’ll be rewarded. Also, his wife might run for office again and she’s going to need funds again.   McCabe needs to go. He thought he was getting Comedy’s job by playing ball and probably thinks he’s still got a shot at this. He doesn’t care what has to happen in order to get there."

"It's not even 5pm on the east coast on this MAGA monday and we already have a Democrat congresswoman going to *prison* for defrauding a charity and another Dem in California accused of forcing women to watch him masturbate. POTUS delivered the crooked BLM (not the racists, the other one) a massive BTFO in Utah and Judge Roy Moore *will* win the special election for the Senate this week in Alabama despite massive amounts of Soros funded lies and fake news.   Now back to your regularly scheduled MAGA shitposting. No Brakes! For every pede a coat and for every coat a pede! "
Donald Trump does not teabag his foes when they are defeated.   **He potato-sacks them**.

"The primaries were rigged by Ms. Noodles with care,  In hopes that glass ceilings would be shattered there.  Dem voters were nestled all snug in enclaves  Some bussed and illegal and others in graves.  Melania looked stunning and Donald in a red cap  Both fuming and furious their country was crap.  But then throughout its lands and across its great plains,  Voters decided to make it great again.  And then throughout the twitters and far over the trees  Abounded cacophonous fag calls of ""REEEEEEEEE!!!!!""  They sperged and they raged, many brackish tears shed  ""I'm With Her"" signs discarded as blue states turned red.  High energy flourished. Our victory came.  Don whistled and shouted and called us by name:  ""Now Milo! now Pepe! now Eric, good gents!  On, Junior! on, Tucker! on, Conway and Pence!""  Hilly cried and shat bullets while slugging down liquor  Skippy stopped fucking boys, and they started to bicker.  ""T'was Russia,"" they storied, ""that's how this was won. We'll simply accuse them of things *we* have done.""  We plowed through the meme war, tactical Pepes deployed,  So our jobs could home and see ISIS destroyed.  The Dow's up, border's locked, and perhaps greatest of all,  Like Jerusalem and China, we'll soon get a WALL.  As we fix what O ruined and made us the greatest,  We must always remember: **BILL CLINTON'S A RAPIST**"
That is all.
"Dear Mr. President. So that we may curb graft and inefficiencies in governance, and for a more equitable treatment of taxpayers, why not use blockchain technologies to cut the salaries of redundant civil servants?

The judge also refused to explain the detailed reasons for his recusal. Was it some form of extreme bias that needed to be hidden from the public? If it comes out does it mean that the Flynn plea is null and void until it goes before a real judge who has a legal ability to rule on the case?  What are they hiding?
Why did they lie about Donald Trump Jr the way they did?
"TREASON: the crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government: "
"I wrote this as a reply in another sub to poster who stated they couldn't fathom how Trump came to be, seemed worth it to submit it here too.   Becuase the reality is that the ""educated elite"" have long been the the standard bearers of the democratic party. But only 25-30% of the population holds bachelors or higher degrees.   The educational institutions of the country have turned to draconian liberal ""social justice"" institutions. They are no longer facilities to debate ideas, discuss policy, and ponder theory.  They have become institutions where you are quite literally told what you need do and how you need to think.  So for many years the divide between the elite Democrat leaders and the average American has widened. Rather than embrace any differences of opinion and work constructively to bring people together the democrats spent all thier time calling everyone who didn't hold a four year degree redneck, racist, bigots. Which really couldn't be further from the truth. Many people without formal educations have just as much or more true intellect, and morality as those that have received them.   All the sudden in America if you went to (Christian) church, or owned a gun, or thought traditional sexual relations were a good thing, you kind of overnight became an ""enemy of progress"" and were ostracized by the herd mentality of progressivism .   The old expression, ""when you're a hammer, everything is a nail"", think of it as ""when you're an activist, everything is racist."". After years of this demeaning and dismissive attitude people eventually got tired of being labeled racist, bigots, homophobic. Those terms got soo overused by the left trying to shame people into agreeing with them that they lost thier value. If you didnt protest for Michael brown, you were a bigot. If you thought BLM shouldn't use violence or block roads, you were a racist. If you even hesitated to say that you 100% accepted Caitlyn Jenner, you were a homophobe.   Meanwhile an ""education"" is given an undue significance while the institutions of family, church, and community were being attacked. Dont mistake this for me ""attacking"" education. There is a clear need for it and if done properly it can expand the horizons of the student. But there is very little about the American higher educational system that is being done ""properly"".  Enter Trump. He connected with those people in an almost inconceivable way. They finally had a champion that didn't demand they sacrifice thier values in the pursuit of progressivism. While he definitely had his flaws and was brash and crass, people were drawn to him.   To well a educated (indoctrinated) progressive, Trump is an unexplainable enigma. They simply can't comprehend it as it breaks every narrative they believe in. With the media's complicity feeding thier outrage they simply are growing more indignant by the day. Everything he has done has been portrayed through the media in as negative light as possible, remember ""when youre and activist, everything is racist sexist, etc....)"". Many Americans see through it though.     To the average American that values family, individual liberty, personal responsibility, respect for the law, its pretty easy to see how we got here. Unfortunately the media and educational institutions have simply doubled down on thier ""progressivism"" in response to Trump, and the divide is only going to get worse. "
According to the fake news channels. (They are trying to give them political cover)

What a shame for the 12k workers; most probably don't give a shit about politics at all and just want to bring a paycheck home to their families.  It's a new CEO now, but he's obviously been left to clean up Immelt's shit."

"In my opinion, Democrats knew the only way they can get the allegations on Trump to stick is to make them seem non-biased. So essentially they threw members of there own party under the bus for months now with the end game of getting Trump. Notice how not a word was said about the Trump accusers in the beginning of this shit storm but now that the sexual assault storys are the juiciest thing on the news they bring back the Trump accusers.. This all seems like one YUGE set up. After realizing the whole 'Russian Collusion' isn't going to get Trump impeached they knew they needed a bigger story, one where they learn from there mistakes and don't put as much spin on it. "

"POTUS &amp; his team are probably doing this already.  Just like Russia, Russia, Russia, the media is not going to let this go unless he gets in front of it. As a woman I this it's crazy to not expect a man to not act like a man when we are running around in bathing suits &amp; sexy outfits. Women certainly pay attention when men run around in bike shorts &amp; other reveling clothing. As I have always said ""I'm married not dead"".  People dress in clothes that makes them feel sexy &amp; good about themselves. I know the Feminists are going to crucify me but enough is enough!

"[WP] Mr. Trump, has just informed Hope Hicks that he is taking an US Air Force supersonic aircraft, with his best Secret Service agent and his Air Force One Pilot, and 'he will visit US Bases in Japan, Iraq and Afghanistan' on Christmas Eve, before a less than an hour long early morning TOP SECRET Christmas Mass at the Jerusalem Embassy of the United States in Israel on XMAS Morning.   The world can only find out, after Trump returns to American Airspace at Bamberg, Germany, after a supersonic flight from Israel to end at 2:45AM. Hope Hicks has been tasked with three telegrams, the first to North Korea, alerting Kim Jung Un of the US’s first official overfly of a US Pilot in North Korean Airspace with Taiwan and Japanese air force escort, the second to Putin inviting him to brunch in Germany with subordinate Angela Merkel, and the third to Hillary Rodham Clinton to be phoned in by Hope Hicks at precisely 3AM, with the top secret message “the view is beautiful above Jerusalem!”  The night begins at Kirtland Air Force Base, after a New Mexico GOP fundraising event for Trump 2020, hosted by Susana Martinez and the Utah Congressional Delegation. Director General Hicks waves as the USAF stealth jet leaves ABQ airspace bound for Taiwan under cover of a Arizona afternoon.  "

" I'm addicted to police scanners at night. We listened as Vegas was happening, hearing about all of the other casino shootings in real time. Last night Ventura county lit up around 10pm and I tuned in again to hear the truth about the situation.  Last night, there were reports of single trees on fire scattered around the city. I listened as reports from officers cleared smaller fires not associated with the larger fire.  The NWS has been warning about a high fire possibility for a few days, if someone was going to start chaos, last night would have been the time as winds are now about to whip this fire directly into the path of millions of homes.  My gut says its intentional. (No solid proof, intuition only.) There have been multiple deaths not reported yet of loved ones worried about family only for the first responders to report back they're dead. Every hour or so they find a victim. Pray for these people. Their leaders have failed them. Their leaders have failed these incredible first responders. Their leaders have destroyed their state.  Pray. God help California.

...for the Trump Curse to kick in on Mueller.
"With the release of information about Strzok, Ohr, and other members of the FBI+DOJ, the House has enough evidence to start a formal impeachment process. I'd suggest maybe going after McCabe and/or Rosenstein (both of whom are susceptible to impeachment, as they hold public offices that required Congressional confirmation) right after the tax reform bill passes.  Why?  An impeachment process would galvanize media attention on the evidence presented. This would enable Gowdy and other House centipedes to air as much evidence as they have about the FBI's biased mishandling of the Clinton investigation, the Mueller appointment, and every other piece of dirty laundry in the McCabe and/or Rosenstein team(s). It would entirely undercut any charges anybody might want to bring against Trump.  Most importantly, though, it would communicate that the Congress will hold biased members of the Dept Justice and FBI accountable. Keep in mind that an impeachment is a political process, not a legal process; I'm not suggesting that anybody in DOJ or FBI broke the law (though they might have). Rather, they have seriously damaged their institutions' credibility. They deserve the full censure of the Congress and prevention from ever holding public office ever again.     "

Would it be possible to make a law that allows illegal aliens to legally steal from their employers? Most employers use illegal labor because they are outside of the justice system and can be treated as slaves. Turn the tables and allow illegals to steal anything they want from their employers. If they get caught the worse that could happen is they are fired. They get to keep anything they stole.  This would impose a very harsh and instant penalty on people that employ illegals without requiring any government enforcement.

"In Jerusalem's history, it has been attacked 52 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, besieged 23 times, and destroyed twice.  Here are some simple facts:  * 1. Israel became a nation in 1312 B.C.E., two thousand years before the rise of Islam. * 2. Arab refugees began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern State of Israel. * 3. Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 B.C.E, the Jews had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years. * 4. The only Arab domination since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years. * 5. For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity. Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital, and Arab leaders did not come to visit. * 6. Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 hundred times in Bible. Jerusalem is not mentioned once in the Koran. * 7. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem. * 8. Jews pray facing Jerusalem. Muslims pray with their backs toward Jerusalem. * 9. Arab and Jewish refugees: Arabs were not driven out of their homes. Following the UN decision on Partition in 1948, the Arab refugees were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders, promising to purge the land of Jews. They argued that an ""Arab presence"" would only get in the way of the planned devastation. Sixty-eight percent left without ever seeing an Israeli soldier. * 10. The Jewish refugees were forced to flee from Arab lands due to Arab brutality, persecution and pogroms. * 11. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated to be around 630,000. The number of Jewish refugees absorbed by Israel from Arab countries is estimated to be the same. * 12. Arab refugees were INTENTIONALLY not absorbed or integrated into the Arab lands to which they fled, despite the vast Arab territory. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees since World War II, theirs is the only refugee group in the world that has never been absorbed or integrated into their own peoples'lands. Jewish refugees were completely absorbed into Israel, a country no larger than the state of New Jersey. * 13. The Arabs are represented by eight separate nations, not including the Palestinians. There is only one Jewish nation. The Arab nations initiated all five wars and lost. Israel defended itself each time and won. * 14. The P.L.O.'s Charter still calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. Israel has given the Palestinians most of the West Bank and autonomy under the Palestinian Authority, and has supplied their police and security forces with weapons. * 15. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated and the Jews were denied access to places of worship. Jewish grave markers were used to build public urinals in occupied Jerusalem. Under Israeli rule, all Muslim and Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths. * 16. The U.N. record on Israel and the Arabs of the 175 Security Council resolutions passed before 1990, 97 were directed against Israel -- notwithstanding the fact that the Arabs refused to participate in the 15 nation United Nations Commission of Palestine which recommended partition in 1948 and sought immediately to undo its work by force of arms. * 17. Of the 690 General Assembly resolutions voted on before 1990, 429 were directed against Israel. * 18. The U.N. was silent while 58 Jerusalem Synagogues were destroyed by the Jordanians between 1948 and 1967. * 19. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians systematically desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives between 1948 and 1967. * 20. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians enforced an apartheid-like policy of preventing Jews from visiting the Temple Mount and the Western Wall between 1948 and 1967.  "

"Has there been a time when we were propagandized by the media? Sure. Every day for the last 20 years at least. Has there ever been a time when all the stops were pulled, and the absolute purpose was to properly gaslight everyone, without qualification? No.  This isn’t even a Russian disinformation campaign, and those are already destructive. This is what happens inside of countries when we are about to overthrow their government. For examples, see Iran in the 50s, all the way to Ukraine in the last few years. The purpose isn’t to convince everyone that Trump is bad and we should impeach. At this point, the purpose is to make everyone so distrustful of everything around them that they will only accept their own echo chamber as “truth.”  This is the precursor to the creation of civil war. People are being purposely separated from the ability to discern the truth, no matter what the desired truth might be. Take a moment to hug your neighbor, speak with your ideologically different family, share a moment of peace with those you otherwise disagree with. Tomorrow may be too late, because the end result of this may be more destructive than anything we have ever witnessed as living beings.  I pray that we can come through to the other side of this dark tunnel in one piece, but I cannot see any peace on the path we’re being led down. I say led, because we are no longer in control of our republic - any of us, left or right. If you believe in God, please pray. If not, do whatever it is you do to try and bend the universe to justice. Thanks for reading."

I could have sworn today I heard there was a text message or email between peter strzok and lisa page:  Page was worrying about the text messages/email and being caught saying the things they said about Trump. One of them saying that the other should not worry about it because the phones are untraceable.  Did anyone else hear this or read this. It is very important as it shows their awareness of what they were doing against Trump unethical and illegal.

"As someone who used to be the biggest Eminem fan there was, I can confirm that the Trump Curse is well upon Eminem.   Eminem released a song last month, ‘Walk on Water’, with Beyoncé. Yet despite two of the biggest names in music, the song flopped at the charts, hasn’t managed to crack 50 million YouTube views (as of writing). It is his first ever lead single to fail to crack the top 10 in the charts. His new song ‘Untouchable’ which is about so called “White Privilege” is also failing in terms of YouTube views and sales. Untouchable hasn’t passed even 5 million views in almost 3 days, and this is even more remarkable when you consider how these days music artists obtain 5 million views hours within release of a new song.   What makes this even more devastating for him is that his new album ‘Revival’ is due for release in 5 days! Imagine that, an Eminem album due for release in 5 days but no one has a clue because due to two low energy singles which have failed to garner any buzz for the album. I predict this album will struggle to crack one million sales, and will be his first album to not go Multi-Platinum.  The Trump Curse is truly real and strikes again as the best selling hip hop artist, and best selling artist of the past decade fades into obscurity. "

You'd think they'd be in favor of it, based on the countless articles about how the world is dying because of the amount of people in it.   Right?  I mean, according to the media, this bill single handedly solves climate change.it even takes into account the next 10 or 11 billion people.  Negative carbon footprint for humanity, here we come!"

"Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites, — in proportion as their love to justice is above their rapacity, — in proportion as their soundness and sobriety of understanding is above their vanity and presumption, — in proportion as they are more disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good, in preference to the flattery of knaves. Society cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.   "

"Net Neutrality is basically the opposite of the name. As others have observed many institutions, laws, orgs, etc on the left use this strategy. For two reasons...  1. Leftists don't want to read and learn...they want to be told what to think. Academic debate with a leftist is solely about what they ""think"", it is not rooted in fact or truth. And to the leftist, if you ""feel it"" hard enough it must be valid.   2. Much like their strategy to slander opponents with accusations of the very crimes the left is themselves committing, this is all meant to create chaos and confusion. Chaos and confusion is a strategic goal of fascists, communists, anarchists, leftists and most globalist secret societies.   We are losing this battle...it may seem because Trump is in the WH and there is smoke around Hillary that we are winning, but we aren't. We are losing. Truth be told I wonder if it is too late at this point.   Rationality is gone Truth is gone Respect is gone  Hostility towards whites and Christians and Americans and families and conservatives has NEVER been higher. It is open and applauded by the main stream and millions are being indoctrinated every day. If you think Fake News has a loud voice in the US, you should see it in other nations.   I used to see these stories about refugee crime in the EU, and people would post on here ""If that happened here we kick their ass..."". But the truth is we don't (Steinle). The former administration still has moles in place trying to affect a coup of the current administration. The FBI, IRS, EPA, FDA, FCC, and every other Federal Agency was weaponized against us....weaponized against Democracy.   Meanwhile, the Chicago kidnappers are let off. An election is stolen in AL.

"Disclaimer: I'm not a math professor. I've done the best I can to get as much data as possible which can be held with reasonable confidence and reasonable projections, both on the low and high end of the spectrum. It's very difficult to find the number of registered democrats and republicans within a given state, however if I overlooked some obvious as fuck site please forgive me.  ----  52% of registered voters are registered Republicans, but historically an average of 60% has voted for the Republican candidate. [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Alabama)   That leaves 48% of registered voters as neutral (which was 12-15%, we'll settle for 13% for neutrality and easy math) or democrat.  This means that about 35% of the total registered voters are democrat and will always vote democrat.  [Source for leanings above](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/party-affiliation/by/state/)  [Source for totals below](http://www2.alabamavotes.gov/electionNight/statewideResultsByContest.aspx?ecode=1000915).  Total registered voters: 3,326,812  Total Actual voters: 1,344,367 (40.41%)  Total Democratic votes:  671,151. (49.92%)  Total Republican votes: 650,436  (48.38%)  Projected votes: (Based off historical data and trends)  R:  699,070 52%, conservatively, no pun intended. Historically (60%) 806,620. **Averaged** 752,845  D: 470,528. (35%). It's hard to create an average for democrats as their participation has been as low as 18% and as high as 47%, but we'll settle for a safe, high number of 35%.  Possible sway: 174,767 (13%)  Even if EVERY registered democrat voted, AND we added the ""Neutrals"" (which are 13% of Alabama's political leaning) you'd still be at 645,295. **You'd still be over 50k-100k  votes short even if you included every (projected) registered democrat AND made ALL 13% NEUTRALS FLIP ON TOP OF HAVING SOME OF THE LOWEST REPUBLICAN PARTICIPATION IN 30 YEARS.**  ""But what about Repubs who voted dem?""  Besides the dead ones? Well look at the Republican turnout. In the past 20 years it has only been below 60% a handful of times, and those were for more republican candidates on the dem side than the republican on offering.  **Roy is missing up to 239,000 projected votes** which MORE than accounts for the controversy surrounding the allegations, AND for Republican pacifism.   ---- **TL;DR**  So you'd have me believe that a Republican candidate who is the epitome of a religious politician, lost in Alabama, a state where up to 88% of all voters are Christian (most of which are fundamentalist), against a liberal who supports *abortion*, which is *anathema* for these people. So you'd have me believe that he'd lose an election, where even by the most LIBERAL estimates, Where we added ALL democrats, ALL centralists, AND accounted for lower-than-average participation, he'd win by almost 100k votes?  Fucking kidding me? Of course they cheated. They cheated the fuck out of that."
Anyone know the scoop on this or is it fake news?
"As we celebrate Chanukah I want to pass along my good wishes to all.   This holiday celebrates the defeat of pagan oppressors by the mighty Maccabees!    In 167 BCE the priestly family of Mattathias revolted against the Greeks who had desecrated the Temple by putting idols in it. Battles waged until 139 BCE when the children of Mattathias, called Maccabee, which means ""the Hammer"" reclaimed the Temple.  The Temple had been defiled -- used for pagan worship and even pigs were sacrificed on the altar.  The Maccabees cleaned it, rededicated it (hence ""festival of dedication""). The gold menorah had been melted down by the Greeks, so they made a make-shift menorah which was to be lit with a very special, holy oil. There was only one vial of this oil -- enough for one day. It would take eight days to make more. . .  But miraculously the oil lasted for eight days. . . this is why Channukah is called the Festival of Lights.  ""...and when the royal Hasmonean House gained the upper hand and vanquished them [the Greeks], [the Hasmoneans] searched and found only one flask of oil...with the Kohen Gadol's [High Priest] seal, and it contained only [enough oil] to burn for one day. A miracle occurred and it burned for eight days."" (Talmud, Shabbat 21b).  The Maccabees then purify the Temple and rededicate it on the 25th of Kislev which is the first day of Channukah (this year it begins on December 12th). The first celebration was held the very next year -- 138 BCE.     This Chanukah let us remember that no evil doers can control us against our will.   We have the G-d given right to freedom, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness!    As an aside to my Christian brothers and sisters, the New Testament mentions Chanukah.  ""Then came the Festival of Dedication (Chanukah) at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade.""  John 10:22-23.  So even Jesus celebrated Chanukah!"

"This is my theory:  The democrats wanted to win the seat in Alabama, so to go after Roy Moore they purged John Conyers and Al Franken who were both accused of sexual assault. But, Franken didn't want to resign (he's too into himself for that). So, Franken said he's resign at a later date, expecting Roy Moore to win.  If Roy Moore won Alabama, he'd say that since the Republicans ""elected a child molester,"" he was going to stay.  However, the unthinkable happened and a democrat took the seat in Alabama. BUT, Franken still doesn't want to resign.    Franken resigning is a good thing for the Democrats, because they're end game is getting Trump out of office, and one of their strategies is to say ""he's accused of sexual assault, he should resign.""  If any Democrat accused of sexual assault resigns, then in the eyes of the public, it sets a precedent that that's how politicians should behave when faced with sexual assault allegations - resign.   My theory is that Franken desperately wants to stay in his seat, so he's blackmailing the democrats saying to support him staying, or he'll expose them.  That's why all these democrats are doubling back and saying that Franken shouldn't resign. They don't lose anything if he resigns, the democratic governor of his state would replace him with a new democrat of their choosing.  So why support him rescinding his resignation? They must have something to lose if he does resign, which I believe is Al Franken coming forward to expose them.  What do you pedes think?"

"The ""global"" Internet is the single greatest threat to American security.  Prior to the Internet our country and everyone in it was protected by natural barriers and language barriers. The Atlantic and Pacific oceans protected us from dangerous ideologies. Ideologies such as Feudalism, Communism, Fascism, Cronyism, and Capitalism.  Our country is not based on Capitalism, Feudalism, Communism, Cronyism, or Fascism. The United States of America is the first of its kind in recorded human history. Our nation is founded on the principles of individual freedom, tolerance, and community service.  The principles of our country are enshrined in our Constitution. We are 'the' Constitutional Republic governed by citizens who are elected through a democratic process. You might say our country is based on a mixture of Democratic-Republicanism and Federalism.   For over 200 hundred years the function of our government as a part of American life and our Constitution have been debated based on the original principles of Democratic-Republicanism and Federalism. Some details of how the government should operate are not clearly defined by the Constitution, I believe, by design.  I often argue the ambiguity of our Constitution on some issues has forced us to constantly re-evaluate the meaning of the Constitution against the backdrop of current affairs, again, I believe, by design.  Some things are clearly defined in the Constitution such as the right to bear arms, and the freedom of religion, press, and speech. While others are open to interpretation. In order to properly interpret the Constitution, I believe people MUST understand the history of how our nation came to be and those same people should be a part of the American experience.  The Internet connects not only Americans but also billions of other people around the world. People who have no personal experience with the kind of freedom we have in the United States. People who see things from a completely different perspective than we do not comprehend the duty that comes with our freedoms.  The people of the United States are exposed to ideologies that were relegated to the dustbins of history by our founding fathers. Those ideologies such as socialism, communism, capitalism, feudalism, cronyism, and fascism are in no way compatible with the narrow scope of our Constitution or the vision laid down and enshrined in our Constitution and garnered by our history.  Our educators have failed to properly educate the last two generations in our country. As a result, dangerous ideologies have begun to fester in the collective consciousness of the American people. The narrow debates between ideologies that had roots in Federalism and Democratic-Republicanism have broadened to include debates between very dangerous ideologies as broad as communism and capitalism.  Our education system has failed to teach the most basic of principles about our Constitution. This has lead to a populace who doesn't know why our Constitution exists in the first place. If we don't educate the American people about the dangers of failed ideologies including communism, capitalism, feudalism, cronyism, fascism, socialism and so many other ideologies our country is at risk for an ideological takeover, or worse divisions that cannot be healed for decades if those divisions can ever be healed without a civil war.  There are forces from around the world working to divide the American people against ourselves. If we don't stop the dangerous influences of foreign nations and foreign peoples, our nation could collapse from within, long before any foreign invaders land on our shores.  I believe the United States Congress should pass laws that require internet service providers to clearly mark the origin of communications from around the world. For example, users on Facebook should be able to easily determine that someone involved in an online conversation is from another country, and what country they are from. The same is true of Twitter, and other platforms like them. Websites should be clearly marked with a country of origin.   Legislation should be passed allowing the Federal Government to inspect all international communications. No international communications should be encrypted in a way that would prevent border and customs agents from inspecting them.   All encrypted international communications should be blocked, except for official United States government communications. We inspect fruit, luggage, and mail that crosses our borders. We should do the same for internet traffic. A nation without borders is not a nation at all, that includes national borders on the internet.  The inspection of international communications would in no way violate our rights. If that were the case, we would be allowed enter the United States carrying whatever we want. In the same way, we protect our agriculture and livestock from dangerous and invasive disease, we must protect our country from dangerous and invasive ideologies that are not compatible with our Constitution."

"The Federal Reserve is a private corporation with control over both interest rates and the quantity of money in circulation. Furthermore when the economy requires additional currency for circulation, we borrow it from the Federal Reserve at the ""Federal Reserve Lending Rate"" instead of printing it debt-free like a sovereign nation should.  *“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”* – **Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809)** "

Does he realize that if this doesn't get passed this year the stock market will drop and consumer confidence will drop and possibly cause a recession. If that happens we won't have to worry about the tax credit because HE WILL be TOTALLY responsible for putting 1000's of parents out of work and onto welfare.   Good going Marco Retardio.

It only makes YOU and the congress look bad and spiteful at BEST and you will probably lose your position in congress and that is a big posibility if this doesn't pass because of you fuckhead. If someone knows him then give him this common sense post of US conservative anger at why he is one of the big reasons congress has such a low approval rating and the one thing this tax bill would have gone a long way in remedying that but nope it's morons to the rescue of the bad reputation and this moron is wearing a cape like a retarded superhero since he thinks he knows better than than everyone else.

They started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on them. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to AT&amp;T but I'm literally in shock from this extra money. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck did someone make this? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so stupid. I want a future to believe in. I want more of my money to go to globalist shills. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought I thought more money was supposed t go to Planned Parenthood and the DNC??? This is so fucked."

"They are saying he'll wait to sign in January to avoid automatic spending cuts in 2018. However doesn't the Constitution state that if a bill isn't signed in 10 days it becomes law?  Thus, the law is in effect on Dec 31 anyway which would trigger said cuts. What am I missing?"

"Here’s an easy way to redpill some lost liberals. Many in blue states are complaining about the reduction (and almost elimination of State And Local Tax deductions). Well you can explain it to them the following way:  Lib: “Boo hoo, salty tears, i can believe Drumpf is sticking it to the Blue states by getting rid of salt deductions”  Pede: “Bill Clinton is a rapist, infowars.com. It’s only fair because blue states are basically robbing the federal programs of funding”  Lib: “You are a raycissss, but please explain”  Pede: “Well you have people that want to be able to choose their school and not have to send their kids to private school. But they have to pay a lot of property tax. So they are fighting to get some of their property taxes back because they aren’t using the public school system.”  Lib: “Yeah but that’s dumb. Taking money away from the public school system means that we won’t have enough money to pay for the teachers and millions will die”  Pede: “Well that’s what happens today with SALT deductions. There are federal programs that we all have to pay for and they cost money. But the states want to be able to spend it on their own programs. So the IRS has this rule where you can deduct the amount of state taxes from your income and pay less federal taxes”  Lib: “Well so??”  Pede: “Well libshit states like CA are increasing taxes constantly and all the rich liberals keep deducting more and more from federal programs. Then the federal programs are often poorly funded and we keep taking on more debt. So it’s only fair that libshits like you pay your fair share and stop stiffing the federal programs that you libshits all want”  Lib: &lt;cries irrationally and mumbles Drumpf&gt;"

"I want the illegal voting to stop. I want to send back as many illegals as possible, especially the adults that vote against us (illegally) and take our jobs and drive down our wages and who keep having babies that take up our benefits. I want to stop the flow of drugs and terrorist gang bangas across our borders. I want a wall to make it harder for them to come back. I want higher funding for ICE. I want illegals to be terrified of walking down the street in broad daylight.  So spare me the ""shill"" insults.   We can have something in place of DACA that **kicks out the vast majority** of kids (say, anybody over 4 years old) and *all* the adults. No citizenship for the babies and toddlers who remain. None. Zero. Zilch. In exchange, a wall. In exchange for no illegal adults taking up our jobs and making babies. And no tolerance for illegal voters. And funding for more federal investigation of potentially illegal voters. And God almighty, what else do you want?   **Every red-blooded pede in the halls of T_D wants to MAGA.** If Trump sees a path forward to getting us everything we need, I say what the hell do we have to lose?  That said, I love you all. I sincerely mean it, even those of you who called me a shill today. You're doing it because you love this nation, and for that I love you, even when we disagree.

"&gt;Dear President Trump,   &gt;I am writing this open letter on Reddit in the hopes that one of your people might glance at this and be able to forward it your direction.  I am no longer on any social media platforms so I cannot tweet you or Facebook you.  I leave this letter open so that other haters, doubters, and liberal treason artists might see the effect you have already had on lower middle class Americans such as myself.    &gt;This year is the first year in my 11 years of self-employment that it has been possible for me to happily provide my family with the best Christmas I have been able to give ever before while still remaining debt free, and a lot of that is because of you.  I am in the public service industry as a barber.  It's not a great living but it gets the bills paid and keeps me inside when the weather is harsh.    &gt;This year has been a bit different, though.  I am seeing more and more military personnel come to my business now instead of getting the much cheaper (but much more lousy) haircuts on the base.  Where usually my customers would come once a month, the military personnel are coming once a week.  More of my regular elderly customers are coming more frequently because they love talking politics!  My shop used to severely discourage ""political talks"" because it would cause fighting under the disgraced President Obama, but under the MAGA-agenda, every single person in my small town seems to be on board save for a few very, very elderly men who don't realize that their democratic party left them years ago and it's not even paying any attention to them.  They are 90-95 year old men that have unmovable loyalty to their party, and I respect that, but I pity them because they know not what they are praising.  Still, the number of those types are 1 to 50 in my shop.  It's a heavily conservative town, with heavily Christian values, and it's made the work environment a joy to discuss your actions in defeating the corruption in Washington, D.C.  &gt;Every year around Christmas, with property tax bills hitting at the same time, I'm usually forced to max out a credit card and scrape by a meager few gifts for those I love and then I pay for it  until about August.  NOT THIS YEAR!  Not only was I able to provide EXCELLENT gifts for ALL of my family (not just my child and my wife, but my mother, father, nieces and nephews, in-laws, grandparents, etc.), and I was able to do this all while leaving that credit card ALONE!  I even have two more working days left before Christmas Vacation, and they're the two busiest days, and in those two days I'll be able to pay off my utilities for January AHEAD OF SCHEDULE!    &gt;And this is just the beginning!  YEAR ONE!   I am 33 years old and I have never in my entire life been so happy and so proud to be an American (EAGLE SCOUT, sir, so I was always proud to be an American, but this is more) than I have been under your presidency.  Thank you for doing what you do, and I hope by the grace of God that somehow this letter's contents can reach you so that for a change, you receive praise and respect and credit where all of that and MORE is not only due, but way OVERDUE!    &gt;To you, sir, and your most gorgeous, beautiful, and loving and caring family, I wish you the Merriest of Christmases, outstanding health, everlasting peace, and more in the life and light to come under our loving Lord, Jesus Christ.  God bless you and your family, and thank you!  &gt;-A Proud American and never wavering MAGA diehard  Thanks for letting me post this here, 'pedes.  I gave up on social media and this is my only way of getting this out there, maybe one of his guys (our guys) will spot this and pass it on.  And even if not, it felt good to get it off of my chest.  Merry Christmas to you all as well.  Without you guys, this never would have been possible.  In the immortal words of Tiny Tim..   #God bless us [all], everyone!"

&gt;[Story](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-israel-iran-secret-pact-2017-12)   Then these protests start virtually out of nowhere  Couple this with the fact that a report surfaced that we would Be at war by March 20th with NK    &gt;[NK War in 12 Weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-e0FFkpsao)  Is it a stretch to think that we are behind these Protests in order to isolate NK from a Key ally and at the same time possibly eliminate a dangerous Regime in Iran and complete a 2 for 2 Nuclear disarmament sweep?

"[Genesis 1:20-23 KJV] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day."
WTF is wrong with these assholes?  History is being made. This could be a catalyst in reigning in the mess in the middle east.  I see nothing on the NY Times website about this.  Such FAKE news.

"Don't go all out about talking about the evils of Soros and how he's a nazi (he is) and how he completely tanks economies as if it's gambling and a source of fun for him.  Instead, tell them about how he's the democratic party's top donor, and one of their richest, and how he evades (now old) tax law to avoid paying taxes in the US but continues to run the democratic party's pockets almost single handed. Tell them that their party officials and elected officials are absolute hypocrites by citing the name of George Soros.  This will peak the curiosity of most democrat voters, and they'll do their own research on his activities, especially if you provide initial ""unbiased"" (totally biased but they think ABC, CNN, NBC are all neutral) sources that clearly detail Soros' tax evasion in the US that they are angry at other billionaires for but for some reason not him. The more research they do on him, the more red pilled they will become.  Here are a few links that they might be willing to read:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2015/05/01/geoge-soros-may-owe-billions-in-taxes/#565066fc1108  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-30/george-soros-s-tax-bill  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/01/george-soros-reportedly-could-face-up-to-7b-tax-bill-after-delaying-payment-for.html (they may not like this one because it's ""EVIL FAUX NEWS"" so show them the first two)  "

"They had the attorney listed as a “vettor” alongside big white collar crime attorneys, cyber hacking crime experts, and media personalities who would all perpetuate the Russia narrative down the road.  No coincidences here: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails//fileid/8658/2344  Name 1 - Steve Bachar: “While a student at Emory, Bachar specialized in the study of **Soviet affairs** and worked part time for the nascent Soviet and East European Studies Program. He cites the program's first director, Professor of Political Science Thomas F. Remington, as the most influential of his mentors at the University. ""A lot of what I learned at Emory was very useful to me,"" he says. ""It [has since] helped to have a strong political background and a sense of history in order to negotiate with the [Russian] foreign ministry, for example.""   the January [1995] trip [to Moscow], the president and first lady spent the night in the Kremlin. There were about eight or ten of us who stayed there with them, and after the state dinner, the Russians all went home. Yeltsin went out to his dacha, and they essentially left the Americans alone. We were able to just wander the Kremlin at will.   Name 2: Eric Holder - You know him. Riot in the streets.  Name 3: Margaret Richardson is a tax and business consultant. Until June 2003, she was a tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young, where she was the National Director of IRS Practice &amp; Procedure and an adviser to the Foreign Investment Advisory Council in **Russia.**  Name 4: Julissa Reynoso: “Over the next two years, two top State Department officials — Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Julissa Reynoso — secretly negotiated with Cuban officials in Creole restaurants in Port-au-Prince, subterranean bars on Manhattan's East Side, and a hotel lounge in Santo Domingo,””  Name 5: Abbe Lowell- Defended Clinton during Lewinsky. Defended Gary Condit. **Defended Jared Kushner later on** Argued multiple Supreme Court cases. Mentioned in Wikileaks emails multiple times. Mostly the Clinton Campaign reaching out to him for expertise on how to not go to jail re: classified emails   &gt;”Mr. Lowell,  it’s an honor to virtually meet you. I should preface this by saying I’m a jailhouse lawyer as a result of being around Cheryl and others for so long and so intensely.” -[Phillippe Reines](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12969)  Name 6: Deanne Maynard clerked for justices Stephen Breyer and Lewis Powell Jr., has argued 11 cases before the Supreme Court. Was assistant to US Solicitor General Elena Kagan.  Name 7: Jamie Gorelick - **later defended Ivanka Trump before handing her role to above named Abbe David Lowell**  ——-  I should stop there.

[ He is Rosneft’s Attorney.](https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-shields-attorney-records-on-russian-oil-giant-rosneft/) The Same Russian oil company whose meetings with Sessions and Papadopolous were central to the Steele Dossier’s legitimacy early on.

"It was announced I'd be getting a 17% raise starting the first! Because of that, after calculating my budget for the next year, I was able to contribute the full amount into an IRA for this year and also put some towards private investments. The stock markets, and thus my IRA and other investments, are up, and 2018's shaping up to be even more amazing!  Thanks to you all for helping get GEOTUS elected and making this the best timeline!"

These guys gloating about their win and getting the illegal off for murder won't play well with John Q. Public. This is a PR win for MAGA
They are all registered Democrat!!!!
Am I the only one? Wouldn't it be hilarious if he dug in and refused to resign? Really piss off Conyers and the CBC.
Why does Google choose to not make today Dec 7th an honorary Google doodle of Pearl Harbor? 
Imagine if there were states and cities that brazenly refused to enforce federal gun laws and even actively worked to prevent federal enforcement of these gun laws. The left would be screaming for the national guard to be sent in.
"I’ve been noticing this more and more lately and while it’s not that big of a deal, it’s definitely disrespectful. Just today I read an article on the news app about President Trump’s recent tweets (top notch reporting obviously /s) and referred to him as Trump throughout. Sad!"
Bill Clinton is a Rapist.
"Chuck Schumer through this idiotic visa scheme, is responsible for the 8 deaths in Manhattan. Yet, that topic has now faded away from mainstream.  Anything being done to end this insane lottery that is deadly and unfair to immigrants who can't use such shortcuts?"
It is happening!  This will be a historic week.  BUT we all need to be prepared...the evil will pull out everything they have to discredit Trump.  They now know that they are going down and will fight to their bitter end.  We all need to Stand Strong and know that Good will prevail!

It's multiplication factor produces a net effect that now seems to be 24 hours after public exposure to hating on GEOTUS.
"How did the Republicans trick the Democrats into electing a known KKK member for 50 years?  This guy personally filibustered the civil rights act of 1964.  This guy actually said that the words, ""All men were created equal was not to be taken literally"".  And why didn't this guy switch parties back in ""muh big switch?""  Because no such switch occurred.   The statue is still standing.  That's all I'm saying."

"I am self employed. If I buy health insurance at $1,250 per month with a $5000 deductible how can I win? If I got sick enough that I needed the insurance there is no way I could ever afford to keep making the insurance payment. Am I missing something or has Obama made health insurance a complete scam? "
"The total amount of money that should have been charged for Trump living in Liberal's heads.  &amp;nbsp;  *He does it rent free, because he is such an awesome guy.*"
"Not in a million years did I see this angle of attack. Hats off to you patriots of the intel community  SPEZ., You must watch Jim Jordan and Trey Gowdy's House Oversight appearance today. Mostly Jordan. He lays out the exact way this all ties into Strzok. We know the FISA warrant basis was the dossier. We know that was a DNC hit job. Jordan sounded VERY confident Strzok applied for the warrant. Then he goes on to say all of Muellers team is compromised as anti-Trump. ""Why single out Strzok?"" He asks. I know why. They linked his comms in with either, Hillary, Obama, or the DNC and he was told to apply for a FISA   SPEZ 2 Jim Jordan with Wray today  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isK_oHRySGI"

"http://news.gallup.com/poll/185759/widespread-government-corruption.aspx  Does anyone actually believe that number went down the past 3 years?   If you need any more arsenal when a shill tells you that you need the approval of liberals to arrest a criminal, just hit me up. I've been swatting down shills all day today who think Trump has no support to Drain the Swamp."
"My daughter goes to a very diverse public school, she's in 6th grade. They show CNN 10 daily for current events. Recently there was a segment about the Christian bakery and gay wedding cake. The teacher then had a pop-up debate.   Upon hearing about this you can imagine how infuriated I was (having learned the truth about it here on t_d and through listening to Rush). I held in my anger. What happened next blew me away...   I asked my 11 year old daughter what she thought about it? She says straight out, ""I think the bakery should be able to not make the cake"". CNN BTFO! This came up today before dinner.   Here's where it gets better. As I'm writing this, I asked my daughter, how many agreed with you on the bakery thing? She said, ""Everyone, no one agreed with the gays."" Lmao!  Even children aren't falling for liberal lies. The more they push this crap on people, the more we reject it.   I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job raising a young conservative girl, proud dad moment.   "
"Keep in mind that the vast majority of people can't function without an authority telling them what to do.  It's extremely rare to see a person thinking everything by himself. It's necessary a great IQ and determination and sadly the average IQ is quite low. So, people who don't believe in a set of rules imposed by a religious system still need a set of rules to function in a daily basis. And for a lot of average Americans CNN &amp; co is their religion. They are not even aware of this. And this is why trying to debate with them is impossible: they ARE their believes. If you attack that they believe is true, they are going to respond emotionally because from their point of view you are attacking them. "
Details: http://archive.is/uJbfO  Suspicious as heck - especially given this revelation from last year: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58w7pq/clinton_foundation_schemed_with_big_pharma_to/
So Al Franken did NOT give a definitive date for resigning. He said 'the coming weeks'. So he is hoping that takes the investigation heat off him. Im dont buy it.
Hate is so toxic it ruins its container. 
"Back in the day, when the public learned the President like or loved something,  the people suddenly   craved it.  Food, destinations, fashion, whatever.  So, I. find myself having Big Mac attacks.  Mcdonalds should capitalize on this since President Trump likes BigMacs."
"I was sitting at lunch with my entire team of coworkers today and they started talking about the tax plan that is working through the legislative branch right now. These are all academics, mostly PhDs and a few candidates. Apparently the tax plan changes some things for students, giving them less of a break, and taxes on endowments which are major funding sources for research (we do research). Of course they didn’t like it and they call this an all out attack on higher education. I can’t help but chuckle, though, that these same people would without hesitation support the government funding every thing they think is good including education, healthcare, family leave, etc. I was tempted to say something like, “hey when the goal is for everything to be “free” for everyone and  to have the government, aka our taxes, pay for it all then you can bet they will eventually go after every possible source of money they can. And it will never stop.” But I thought that would be taken negatively. "
"Can someone with Twitter tweet Matt Drudge and tell him his stupid ass “YOU JUST WON AN IPHONE”, hijack spam on my mobile, is making me murderous?"
Also when do we find out who unmasked Flynn? That's a Felony. Flynn is a American. But then again illegals have more rights then Americans in Liberal America. It still doesn't change the fact that Obama wire tapped the Trump Campaign/incoming Administration this is still Watergate but not what the Media wants us to believe.  
"Being in Texas and supporting Trump in the primaries made me a bit of an outcast wirh the Teddy supporters.  Now when talking politics around here, a simple comment such as ""Yeah, I'm not sure where Trump was going with that tweet"" gets me labelled as a Castro loving snowflake commie.  Folks, it just get any better than this!  MAGA for life fellow Pedes!"
Fuck you Corker
Yep. Title says it all. Why does the Sewage-report still have a fake news story up? So glad I stopped going there....thanks to t_d I have no need for his bias. 
It's as if a referee called a ticky tack penalty in the last 30 seconds against a team that's ahead by 50 points.
I think that covers it.  International affairs have basically been the domain of the president since the start of the country.  Anyone else telling you otherwise is an asshole.  Bill Clinton is a rapist. Infowars.com  Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.  The rule of law is dead. Buy guns.
"I can’t take this shit anymore. Kate Steinle was one of many that have lost their lives to violence due to the actions of an illegal alien. You do a search and it’s nothing but page after page of drive-by shootings, rape, DUI hit and runs, theft, etc. We need to protect our borders. We need implement severe vetting. We need the media to stop bullshitting about the real problems out there. Seriously, I’m so fucking done with this shit. "
"- It gets rid of state tax deductions, which have very unfairly benefited some of the richest states such as NY or CA. - ‎It taxes colleges more. Colleges disproportionately benefit the ""highly educated"" elite who go on, on average, to be the highest earners. - ‎The tax-exempt savings plan that used to be only usable for college education can now be used for primary and secondary education, as well as homeschooling expenses. Again, any deductions that can only be used for higher education disproportionately benefit the elite.  - ‎The corporate tax goes down, which will entice companies to bring more jobs to America. Our companies will be competitive again. A high corporate tax in reality is a tax on honesty or on the small corporations that cannot afford to move to a tax haven. The rich giants like Apple will just go elsewhere instead of paying it. - ‎Small businesses will see a much needed tax break. Let's not forget that a small business owner is paying more in taxes than an employee with similar earnings as there are business-related taxes as well as the employer portion of payroll taxes to be paid.  - ‎It severely caps deductions for real estate taxes. Again, this is fair. If a locality has high taxes, those taxes only benefit a given community and not the whole country. No reason the people in that locality shouldn't pay their share of federal tax. At the same time, some deductions are preserved to make sure only the more expensive real estate is affected (progressive.) - ‎Personal exemption doubles, child credits go up. This benefits low and medium income folks, not the millionaires.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm personally all for cutting taxes even more. I'm all for people of all incomes keeping more of what they earn. I know there are great 'pedes here who are professionals living in expensive, blue cities, who will not be better off thanks to this bill. In an ideal world, I'd like those people to pay less, too.  However, no tax bill will ever be perfect. And the people who I think need relief the most will be getting it with this bill. And that makes me happy."
"City is infested with illegals and LA's rejects. Neighborhood is shit, meth house 2 houses down. Clients keep mistaking my house for theirs...  ...Last night a 2010-ish Suburban with 5 people pulled up in my driveway around 2am. Passenger comes to my front door, realizes he has wrong house, and proceeds to walk to the right one.  Not fond of transactions taking place on my property.  2 of them are hanging out on my driveway (driver and passenger 2), passenger 1 is halfway to the other house (cutting across my neighbors lawn like a douche) as I come outside. Parked in front of meth house is a Chevy 1500 van with 4 more people hanging outside.  ""No deals here. Please, get the fuck off my driveway.""  Driver and #2 get it. ""My bad, wrong house.""  Not #1. Clearly, #1 thought he was numero uno.  Turns around as he exclaims ""WHAT THE FUCK!?!"". Makes eye contact. One hand reaches to his crotch, the other towards his ass.  Thought he was trying to draw a weapon... turns out he was pulling up his pants so he can beeline me, for some reason belts don't like to work when they're holding your pants up just below your ass.  The second he set foot back on my driveway, he was promptly met with the image of [Diana](http://i.magaimg.net/img/20k6.png) being locked and stocked.  Stopped dead in his tracks, deer in headlights.  I hope he shat himself.  ""Get the fuck off my driveway.""  Suburban got put into reverse so fast, they didn't have time to close the doors, nor align the steering wheel properly, stumbling over the curb on the way out. Van roaches scattered and fled as well.  I'm lucky nobody was armed, this wouldn't have ended well...  I hate what this city, this state, has become. Yet with all this hate... I still love this city, the good people here (which exist in larger numbers than you may think), I still love the fact...  ...That I was born in the greatest Nation on earth. God bless America, bless my 2nd amendment right, for if I were to face 9:1 without Diana, I wouldn't be posting today.  Let this be a PSA to all law abiding patriots in CA.  Last night I didn't lose my life, guess that counts as a win."

"He would never say so but I'm pretty sure he was down about it.  I didn't know he'd be alone or I would have invited him to be with my family, even if he couldn't make it... just to be sure the gesture was there.  We're all grown, by the way.  I found out yesterday that he spent Christmas alone, and I thought he'd been with a family friend.  I want so much to do something... but I have no idea what... or if there's anything I can do.  I understand if this gets deleted... I'm just at a loss on what to do..."
Can someone help calm me down? I am literally shaking after this vote. I don't have any hope for the future of our country. I don't know what to tell my kids. I've kept them in the dark about Trump winning the election and now this and net neutrality? 
## **Sometimes the silence speaks volumes ..**
"cause he is the one who said the Obamacare mandate was a tax. Democrats passed it with 60, we only needed 50 to repeal. Two campaign promises in one bill. Ahead of schedule, under budget!!! "
That's pretty much it.
Mueller is #NotOurGuy. 
"""they"" have studied our techniques and are launching their first ever serious counter-attacks, coordinated.  They will not succeed.   The war is not yet won.  We must, shall, and will step up our game again.  The God-Emperor will not be stopped. We will MAGA.  They are desperate, and they are losing.  Time to double down.  Shadilay!"
"Now, assuming this all passes and gets signed by the president, you are going to notice something next year.  Your paycheck will be bigger.  Less will be taken out.  Now, since you are so concerned about the deficit you need to take this new money and cut a check to the government.  Or maybe you can send it to a local charity you care about.  Remember, anyone can virtue signal. "
It's Either a White Christmas (Don't need to tell you why that's triggering) or a Green Christmas (Pepe) 
"Luther Strange was Trump's pick, and we didn't listen, instead we overanalyzed the fuck out of the endorsement, kidding ourselves into thinking Trump was secretly for Moore. No. He wasn't. It was exactly what it looked like. Trump wanted Strange, because he knew Moore was such a bad candidate, he couldn't even win a general election in fucking Alabama. We didn't listen. Now we've lost a senate seat, and the Democrats are more emboldened than they've been since Obama was first elected."
"Because it's not being shown on the google business page (?!) and no, I'm not kidding...  that's what I'm seeing anyway. Can others confirm?"

I am not scared and neither should you be
The salty drink I'm getting from all these comments on Twitter and Facebook about the Tax Cut Bill Passing are enough to energize my day. 
FUCK EM IT PASSED ANYWAYS.
"he will resign . . . but it will be for health reasons.  Definitely not because he's being outed as a pervert, noooo sir.  Health reasons. Also possibly he will want to be spending more time with family."
"Good morning. This is my first post on my new account. I'm formally coming out to The Donald family. I just can't take the excitement I feel every morning when I wake up and come on here and see ACTION taking place. I HAVE TO COMMENT! I love President Trump. I admire and adore our lovely FLOTUS Melania. I love the great pedes of The Donald.   I first heard of this sub about a month before the election. I joined under another account that I had. So I've been here, silently lurking, cheering and turning all those arrows orange. This is the most based sub and group of people I've ever seen. Intelligent, fact based and to top it off fucking funny as hell!   I created this new account to more accurately represent who I am. Plus I came to dislike my old name, I don't know what I was thinking BTD (Before The Donald). So yeah, I am THAT mom who LOVES and SUPPORTS our GEOTUS and I've been among your ranks and supporting all of you who post the real news first for a long time now. I'm so glad I came across this sub. And for added extra spicy, I hail from the hotbed of the Democratic, liberal salt mine - Southern California. It's not an easy ride being surrounded by liberals and the ignorant comments that spew from their mouths. I do a lot of tongue biting, especially when they are in herds yapping their nonsense. Ugh.  Anyway, this is pretty much my news source for facts, because you all follow up with links. You give me ammo for when the liberals cry, ""BUT, BUT, PUSSYGATE! GRAB THEM BY THE PUSSY!"" as a reply because they refute real facts and have nothing else to go on. Facts don't matter to them. But for my own sanity I can make them look like the salty little bitches they are and shut their faces up as I drop little red MOAB texts hours later. I love to piss them off. In fact, it gives me great pleasure. Note, I do it with a loving heart and good intentions. I don't fuck with the universe and the power it holds. I'm merely supporting what is meant to be in this interesting timeline we live in. Hopefully they start to pay attention and work through their cognitive dissonance disorder.  So from me to all you fantastic, enthusiastic, full of heart and love for our country, GEOTUS AND CO., I look forward to being a more vocal part of this great movement and sharing my thoughts and feelings more openly than before. You have inspired me. I'm going into the trenches with you all. Xoxo, MagaMilf  TL;DR: Hello fam, I'm happy to join and be a part of this great movement, The_Donald. See you on the battlefront. �� "
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!  HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US!!!!!!!
"If you missed it, Hannity wasn't hosting tonight, Kimberly filled the chair but did not insist herself as host.   These three men as commentators took turns: 1, 2, 3, tonight without host prompt to agree and expand upon one another's outrage and disbelief of the Kate Steinle verdict. Gregg Jarrett (no saint btw) lays down a line that is simply irrefutable.  Charles Hurt doesn't parse words here: https://youtu.be/UypxILIC2SI?t=13m15s ... ""its really sinister, but its true!""  ""Indentured voters"" -- 4 way split screen, 4 immediate nods of understanding. This panel is honestly one and a blue moon.  David Webb had either already left the building and was asked to come back, or was stopped on his way out. He's wearing an overcoat on national TV.   Three men and a woman with conviction!  Edit, forgot link: https://youtu.be/UypxILIC2SI?t=5m45s  Spez: (Idk if I used right?) Anyway, having watched that roll a few time over again, I've decided that those three individually volunteered to participate in that panel on the fly. That's why Kimberly wasn't guiding as a host, those dudes were making their point heard off the cuff and from the heart."
As soon as Donald started talking about the BEATDOWN we gave the dems with the election results!

He “shouldn’t have been charged with anything” but he WAS to FORCE TESTIMONY because THEY were SILENCING Flynn, like they did Manafort. See, when you “cooperate” hand over everything you’ve got and even do things like “offer public testimony, under oath” to things like the “Senate Intel committee” and they reject because YOUR VOLUNTARY OFFER AND WILLING COMPLIANCE doesn’t mesh well with the whole, “you’re guilty of crimes we’re trying to blindly convince the American people you are guilty of” then you being cooperative, compliant, proactive, willing and voluntary, day rant really fit the “narrative” or “agenda” they’re pushing, to “prove” you’re “guilty” in the “court of public opinion”, does it?   They didn’t want Flynn or Manafort to testify. They didn’t want Awan brought in. You’ll see they even tried to help him leave, hence it will prove important later why he was detained at the airport. It wasn’t by accident. It was done so they could show you how “THEY” tried to scoot him off back to Pakistan so he wouldn’t be extradited... or so they assumed. Until a couple months later when “they” watched Pakistan release a family they’ve held captive for a long time, FOR FREE and for NOTHING in exchange. While that release symbolizes MANY THINGS, it also served as a whispered “fuck you” to Clinton, Huma/the Abedin family and the Awan family because Pakistan isn’t going to be bulldozed, exploited and blamed by “them” anymore. Especially when they know “they” don’t pull the strings because TRUMP has made that clear.   This is fact, y’all. You’re gonna find out exactly who technically got the Awan’s hired before Debbie or any Dems even knew who they were. Awan went to Harvard you know... on the same kind of Bin Talal scholarship Obama somehow got, too... hmmm...  http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/151613678  (Tried to archive several times but it keeps giving me an error.

"This little boy lost so much that horrific shooting in Sutherland Springs Texas. He will be in the hospital another 6-8 weeks. When asked what he wants, he asked this. "" I would like cards &amp; pictures of kids with their pets"" . He also said that when he gets out he would like to build a go cart with his friends(and whats left of his family). G'Dad &amp; I have sent him a toy go cart a card &amp; some money to help make his dream come true about building the go cart. With enough money maybe one could be bought.  Does anyone know someone who could possibly donate one? This little guy had been through so much. Perhaps we could help put one under the tree. I know when we get together with one voice we move mountains! You kids are the most loving &amp; caring people I've had the pleasure of knowing. Here's his mailing address.  Ryland Ward P.O. Box 174 Sutherland Springs, Texas 78161"
Just seems like he is kicking the democrats asses all over the place like he knows their weakness. He is unlike any president or politician I have ever known. Seems like its possible he worked as spy for himself to help propelled his candidacy. 
"11/8 Trump is elected 12/29 Obama is a lil salty bitch and wanted to piss Russia off with his sanctions 12/29 Flynn reached out to Russia not to retaliate from Obama’s policy  He’s just guilty of slipping up and saying he didn’t contact Russia in that timeframe. Trump’s direct or senior admin’s involvement is AFTER the election and had nothing to do with the election itself. Trump’s admin reached out to 10+ countries to est. a relationship with them pre inaug. I have no qualm with that whatsoever for any incoming admin. Don’t forget, WikiLeaks showed a shillary aide setting up a meeting with a Chinese official as well."
"Also, HER NAME WAS KATHRYN STEINLE"
"they've now blamed him for  1.) hillarys ""unrecorded-not-under-oath-attended-by-another-person-of-interest-pretending-to-be-her-lawyer"" interview  2.) changing comey's draft that defined hillarys ""gross negligence""  3.)interviewing Mike Flynn and forgetting to mention that it was official   4.) giving immunity to Cheryl Mills and Huma Weiner   spez: 5.) allegedly was the speed reader who cleared weiners laptop after checking the stored shillary emails    so what's next?  is he old enough to have shot JFK?  thought he saw an incoming torpedo on radar at the gulf of tonkin?"

"- Armenia was the first country to declare Christianity as their national religion.  - Armenia is a Christian country surrounded by Muslim countries. - Armenians survived a genocide committed by the Ottoman Turks in 1915 all in the name of religion. - 1.5 million of my people were murdered, raped, starved, and used as slaves by Muslims.   Armenia is to Christianity what Jerusalem is to Judaism. I will be damned before I let some Muslim scum come and take over the land of the free. Armenians are true Christian warriors and most of us love Trump. I just wanted to remind everyone because we get confused for being middle eastern. Don't let Islam be the Trojan horse that ruins your country just as it's done to Europe. Take note from countries like Armenia and Poland."

"I was going to make a lengthy post but Im going to keep it short and sweet.  The named organizations in the title right now are shielded from liability due to being classified as public forums, this means if someone accuses you of sexual harassment on twitter and you lose your job, you can not sue those organizations.  However these organizations behave and operate like a private entity, they can censor your speech or revoke your account at will due to violating their terms of service.  They can't have it both ways, what can be done?  Senator Cruz talks about it more artfully here: https://youtu.be/WA5MaHhVGpM?t=42m25s  42:25 if you want to skip all of Crowders nonsense."

"We get 2 weeks off of school for Christmas. It used to be called Christmas break, but the lefties took to calling it ""winter break"". This makes no sense.   It's part of the left's war on Christmas an Christianity. Basically, there's one reason for the break and that's Christmas. They don't want to say ""Merry Christmas"" anymore and I resent that.   I encourage all of you fellow pedes to go out of your way to say Merry Christmas to everyone you see.   God bless America. "

The mayor is the cause of Kathryn Steinle's death.
"&gt; Nevertheless, as I explained in connection with George Papadopoulos (who also pled guilty in Mueller’s investigation for lying to the FBI), when a prosecutor has a cooperator who was an accomplice in a major criminal scheme, the cooperator is made to plead guilty to the scheme. This is critical because it proves the existence of the scheme. In his guilty-plea allocution (the part of a plea proceeding in which the defendant admits what he did that makes him guilty), the accomplice explains the scheme and the actions taken by himself and his co-conspirators to carry it out. This goes a long way toward proving the case against all of the subjects of the investigation. **That is not happening in Flynn’s situation. Instead, like Papadopoulos, he is being permitted to plead guilty to a mere process crime.**"
"It was right there under our noses, the whole time, hidden in plain sight.  The world is made of language, specifically world-view is made of language.    There is a group of people who don't seem to care about language or understand how it creates the world.  If you try to enlighten them, they tune you out because there is a more compelling and imminent download they absolutely must attend to.  This group of people--I won't say who--consists of those that view our world through the screen of the *selfie* and editing themselves out as perennially blameless in all things: through the historically-absentee, rear-view-mirror of the present moment (or as Zimbardo says present-postiive time orientation), which is created and enhanced by a public-private partnership of corporate oligarchs creating the most perfect consumer illusion in a handy--and affordable--small personal electronic device and the meta-reality augmentations accessible therewith.  These people are the generation of the download.  There is no questioning the download, it's not their way.  But despair of others is not from this realization but from the realization that this generation does not care to learn or care to change, because to do so would be to create deep anxiety which is something intolerable.  Most of us only really freak out with medical problems but with this group, a perceived verbal insult to an underclass is enough to believe we're in ww3.  It  really happens when mom removes all three snow coats, suddenly discomfort exists.  --- **Thought Terminating Projections**  Here's the part that this group won't like to hear.  It's how they've been fooled into orwellian doublethink--it's from the self edit.  Editing out yourself means no introspection so the world is your canvas to project out any abpsych you've got laying around.  Now it seems that language contortions as well as psychological projection are both capable of creating thought-terminating cliches---we knew the former, but the latter--who knew?  It's counter-intuitive, but if you think about it, it's why a closeted gay person can call someone an F word and a black person can call someone else an N word; especially to someone else who is neither of those things and done in anger.    The word ""Fascist"" comes from [italian *fasces* or Latin *fascis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces) and it's literally a bundle of sticks.  I won't say what a bundle of sticks is about, but let me just say I referenced it not 3 sentences ago.    And there's nothing wrong with any sticks, whether they are touching or not and all sticks have a right to happiness and rights and marriage and ...happiness.  Or even if the sticks have 2 balls, like say a two ball and a cain or two-ball-cain, and those balls are boobie balls.  Ok?  Some of you get it.  It's ok if you don't.  And also, it's ok to be white.  And it's ok to have the name Lucius.  Or Lucifer.  Lucifer RichWinner or whatever  Now traditionally *fasci* can be arrows and belt or sticks in a bundle with an axe in the middle, so if the axe is broken, you just wrap the handle with sticks.    The sticks are to represent how people can make something stronger, they are all stronger together.  Ok so now we understand 3 things  1. ) Hillary Clinton's stronger together explains the true heart of fascism, only under the color of thirdwave feminism and all that that entails  2. ) Since team Trump has been accused of being fascist, but the one that were violent were the left, we now understand Team Hillary's 'power move' of psychological projection, and how it had us completely miss this because I'm the only person I've heard say this.    3. ) Our small device did not enlighten some of us like the great equalizing power of the internet had promised.  This is because some people's hate trumps their think.  So I'm editing Hillary's Sign 'love trumps hate' and changing it to ***""Hate Trumps Think""***  Regarding point 2, I'm pretty sure Jay Dyer has probably covered this a long time ago, since looking back on it, it's actually pretty obvious."

"“Trump shall become My trumpet to the American people, for he possesses qualities that are even hard to find in My people these days. Trump does not fear man nor will he allow deception and lies to go unnoticed. I am going to use him to expose darkness and perversion in America like never before, but you must understand that he is like a bull in a china closet. Many will want to throw him away because he will disturb their sense of peace and tranquility, but you must listen through the bantering to discover the truth that I will speak through him. I will use the wealth that I have given him to expose and launch investigations searching for the truth. Just as I raised up Cyrus to fulfill My purposes and plans, so have I raised up Trump to fulfill my purposes and plans prior to the 2016 election. You must listen to the trumpet very closely for he will sound the alarm and many will be blessed because of his compassion and mercy. Though many see the outward pride and arrogance, I have given him the tender heart of a father that wants to lend a helping hand to the poor and the needy, to the foreigner and the stranger.”     Jeremiah Johnson on August 10th, 2015"
"After watching Donald Trump’s speech tonight, and hearing him talk about how well the economy was doing, how unemployment was at a 17 year low, black home ownership was thru the roof, and that GDP is approaching 4%, I started to feel a deep pulse in my groin region. My penis was growing quite large. At first it was fine. I felt like I was ready for a good romping later with my fiancée. I told her that after the speech she was about to have the time of her life (and of course I was excited about the prospect too).   Then The President kept going on about how he pulled out of TPP and the Paris accord. Now my penis really started to swell. The skin was getting tight. Not uncomfortable, but tight. I could hear myself start to whisper, “Donald, stop. My erection can’t get any larger.”  But then the crowd started to chant “LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!!” and again my penis grew larger and larger. At this point the swelling went from fun to scary. More seriously and now audibly I kept saying, “Stop Donald, my erection can’t get any larger.”  He then pivoted and said we were going to have borders on top of borders. He called out the deep state. And he said that we were going to get tax cuts and the economy was going to get better. At this point my penis was the size of full grown watermelon and I was screaming, “DONALD STOP!! MY ERECTION CANT GET ANY LARGER!!!”  At this point I passed out and have just now woke up in the ER. My doctor explained that I passed out because so much blood had entered my penis that there was none left for the rest of my body to function.   I would appreciate some prayers for a speedy recovery so I can continue to MAGA with you Pedes.  Also, I heard he had fake snow fall at the end for Christmas, can any Pedes confirm? "

"So I just got off work ( in case any liberals read this, It's that thing you do for 8 hours everyday, hope that clear up any confusion.) I check news site and lo and behold I see posts on a 4% GDP projection. Wow. There can be no denying that something has changed. What is that? We had the last 8 years with stagnation, rampant spending and a regulation nation. Obama was the first president to have not achieved 3% growth. Now the first year of a Trump's presidency they are projecting 4% That's should be startling if you're a Democrat. There is no spin on Earth that will convince a reasonable voter that he's wrong in thinking""Hey, maybe the new guy is onto something"" The business community sees what has been done and what they think will be done soon.That matters. Trump has rejected Obama's economic policies and we are at 4% growth. That's damning. Obama's legacy is falling apart. Now we will see the talking heads trying to talk this down. No no no. If Hillary had won you better believe they would be hyping this as a Obama-Clinton economic growth. So it's Trump's economy when/it were bad but NOT his , if it was good? TRUMP Promised this.

OPEC might retaliate - With fracking humming along and soon ANWR, they're welcome to try.  4. Upsets the Palestinians - The truth is, since Jihad has gone global you don't hear much about the Palestinians. These days everyone realizes what a bunch of shits they are. They were offered generous deals on 2 occasions and responded with war. What dummy would offer them peace a third time?  5. Upsets our allies - Isn't israel included on the ally list?  6. Will upset Muslims worldwide - In the short term, maybe. In the long term, see #4. Not even Muslims care about them.  7. Might ""derail"" peace efforts - Yeah, like they've been going so well on that front. Maybe it's time to think out of the box. Some respond better to a stick than a carrot.  8. The US gave ""something for nothing"" - I can't decide between ""false premise"" and ""weak tea."" Again, Israel is an ally. Again, it was a campaign promise.

"I just finished watching Godless because it was recommended by my brother. He stays out of political bullshit, but agrees with just about everything I agree with if you do bring it up with him.   Well I’m fucking done. IT’S LITERALLY IN EVERY FUCKING SINGLE SHOW.  We’re talking the Old West here, 1800s. The women all run everything. One big fat pig dyke is the tough one, who can draw faster than any man. She has a relationship with a prostitute. The prostitute also is the teacher in this town. There is also an all black town right next door who proclaim their hatred towards the white town almost every time they are shown. A few times the white people bring it up, and another white person goes “well I don’t blame them”, or “yea they should hate us”. Anyways, low and behold the white kid from town falls in love with the obviously half-black girl from “Blackdom” (yes, literally the name) even though both her parents are as black as a chalkboard. Of course all the indians are presented as peaceful and all knowing. They do everything better than the white people, who they make fun of a good amount throughout its running time. Main woman has a half indian son. Whatever. The best part though is the main woman was was attacked and almost raped by “savages”. Guess what? THEY WERE ACTUALLY MORMONS! It was Mormons who dressed as savages and raped and murdered whole swathes of people. Majority of reviews on iMDB, “NOW THIS IS A REAL WESTERN!” WHAT FUCKING WORLD DO THESE LEFTISTS LIVE IN?!? It’d be insanely comical to me if I didn’t know that this is affecting kids and playing its part in crushing western civilization  Another show I watch because it has or had to do with one of my favorite movies, The Exorcist. Now in the second season of this show, the main dad is single and asian, but fosters a group of kids. One black kid, one blind kid, one fat jewish kid, and one 16 or 17 year old lesbian girl, short colored hair and all. She also is super sassy, so watch out for her. The good priests in it? Because there are bad ones as well. Well the main one is Mexican, the white one is gay and is shown making out with other men in his priestly attire, and a then there is a black one. All the demons and bad people in the show? White. Of course. LITERALLY, and I mean in every sense of the word, every single adult male in the show is demonic.    Please can someone give me a show to watch? I don’t care if there is gay shit in it or if the main person is black or whatever. AS LONG AS IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. Not blatantly crowbarred in.   Also, don’t tell me to do something else. I read enough everyday, go to the gym, work, etc. and sometimes I want to lay the fuck down and relax watching a show.  So any recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks.  Spez - Probably should have gave an idea what I’m looking for. Can’t stand sitcoms, hate sci-fi and comic book shows. Love horror, mafia, period pieces, history, crime dramas, thrillers. Favorite show is The Sopranos.   Thanks for all the recommends guys. Thank God for this place. Really, where else would I be able to ask this and not get banned? Haha.   Really surprised by the amount of responses which tells me a lot of others feel similar to me. I wish there was a special section of T_D for these types of discussions as anywhere else on this shitty site we’d get banned or downvoted and spit on. I’m going to maybe write up a recommend each week and points of discussion, if anyone else wants to join in, let me know. Maybe brainstorm a few ideas on what we want to accomplish with it. "

Marijuana competes with opiates because it's not only a viable pain alternative, it also breaks opiate addiction.  Oops.  It would NOT have happened.

I live in Oregon and I can 100% see comrade Kate Brown raising or instituting new state taxes as a “see I told you so” counter to the new tax bill just so the left can be right about their view of the bill. Is there anything in place to prevent this kind of thing?

"Trump has really revealed the Left’s true nature.  First he got them to defend North Korea, and now he’s being called Hitler for supporting Israel.  **Too. Fucking. Good.**"
Source: Someone familiar with Serta's thinking.

He’s got his grubby little fingers in everything...
"This isn't reaching, I'm not stupid.  Carl meets a middle eastern guy and he is scared off by Rick with warning shots. Carl tracks him down some time later to bring him food and water, the guy gives a monologue to point out his selfless religious motivations for fighting the walkers. So we know hes from the mid-east and religious, after they prove to you very heavy handedly that this guy is a saint who doesn't want any trouble, Carl offers to bring him into his settlement. Carl says ""I'm responsible for you now, thats how it works."" He says ""I don't want any trouble, your dad didn't want anything to do with me"". Carl says: ""sometimes kids have to find their own way, to show their parents the way.""   The scene is not very subtle about the message here. Hes a refugee that Carl wants to bring over the wall into his settlement, that his Dad doesn't trust and wants to keep out. But Carl is going to defy his Dad and show him the light about letting him in.  This is the thing I notice in the walking dead, each season they jump on whatever is currently the social climate of the moment. They already brought in the gay character and went out of their way to make sure everyone knew that they were basically perfect, incorruptible people with the most pure and genuine love of anyone on the show, maybe even the world. So cartoonishly out of context with reality all to validate the left wing social justice.   Now this season they are making sure to put extras with hijabs up front and center and bring in the muslim guy who is also cartoonishly both a victim and the most pure and good person in the world. The problem is, the show has absolutely awful execution and this just rings like insulting levels of pandering.   Basically what Tv will do, is whoever is the victim in style, they make sure to throw into their show or movie and make them into living propaganda, a condensed virtue signalling figure who embodies all of the perfect traits that ""debunk"" the stereotypes and ""hate"". I just saw this in a movie recently where someone was a possible hijacker on a plane and the main character had to figure out who it was, so they obviously had a middle eastern character on the plane and the white people would make comments indicating their distrust in him, but what did the writers INSIST upon this character? Hes actually a doctor who has a wonderful family and they trot him out to prove how great of a guy he is, just completely obliterate any suspicions we could have that hes the bad guy in a movie where it could be anyone.   I'm really just ranting cause Walking Dead sucks and the writing, choreography, characters, it all blows and not just cause they virtue signal with their throw away side characters. "
"I'm 17 (gen z ��) and both of my parents think President Trump is stupid/evil. Both of them voted for Hillary Clinton and my mom watches CNN daily and  refueses to accept him as the President. It seems like I have tried everything and nothing works. Id be cool if they just didnt like him, but they HATE him. I hate seeing my parents get brianwashed like this but it seems like there is no changing their mind about anything. What do I do?"

"My crazy liberal sister and friends are going berzerk over Trump's new tax plan, I keep seeing the same rhetoric over and over, ""rich get cuts, deficit goes up, pretending to give it to poor"" this is all garbage obviously, can someone point me to, or explain why people are reading it this way? Thanks *MAGA* "
I thought I read on this DOM a few weeks ago that Soros now has a large interest in Firefox. Is this true? Any links?
"It's a little off topic I know, but I thought of that when hearing the news of that reboot.  You wanna watch the Twilight Zone, just turn on the fucking news. People are openly calling for president's to be assassinated and no one blinks. California's burning to the ground, boys are girls, you can now determine which race you are, anti-racist is the new racist and the government can see everyone's nude pics with a few clicks.  The most controversial thing I could put on TV right now is Leave it to Beaver. A white nuclear family who respects everyone, never brings up race or politics and tries to live a good clean life with love. No one swears. No one gets naked. No one shoots each other, etc.  It's a depressing shame what this country has come to, but thank God for Trump. "
You know they’ve lost when they’re reduced to shouting like children
"His last vote before Trump was Gore. He's been reading books against liberals lately, although I'm not sure the exact name right now, because he's really sick of PC culture. Any books you guys would recommend?   Looking mostly for serious books, but I'm considering ""Why Socialism Works"" as a gag gift, I think he'd get a kick out of it. "
"They leave out stories of criminals like MS-13 and try to make people feel bad for the inconvenience of deportation (it's not supposed to be a convenient vacation MSM!). And then pull point out how such a large percentage of people are illegal and now it's just so inconvenient and cruel to apply the law. Wouldn't it be interesting to see a similar story about poor Bob Jones, who just wanted a better life so he robbed a bank. How dare the mean police enforce the law and throw him in prison, tearing apart his family in the process. He did it 15 years ago; shouldn't we just let him off the hook at this point? Plus, it hasn't been enforced so much before and tons of people have done it. Should we, or could we even, really punish all of them? Besides, they're generally really nice people otherwise. That makes it ok, right? And how can we be so cruel as to  pull his kids out of the private schools he's been putting them through using that money or confiscate assets he used stolen money to buy? This is the only life they've known, and this is such an inconvenience! Only cruel bigots would take that from them! Bob and people like him are the victims here; can't you see! And it's all Trump's fault for enforcing mean laws based in bigotry!"
He cites the new levels of stupidity exhibited by liberals gives him rightful claim of all of America's economic prosperity under Reagan.

"I found an (old-ish) letter by a Canadian and thought I would share it here  For some context I believe this was written on June 5th, 1973  **Original script of Gordon Sinclair’s commentary:**  “The Americans” The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany.  It has declined there by 41% since 1971 and this Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least-appreciated people in all the earth.  As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtse. Who rushed in with men and money to help?  The Americans did.  They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Misssissippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help.  Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.  When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.  When distant cities are hit by earthquakes, it is the United States that hurries into help… Managua Nicaragua is one of the most recent examples. So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped. The Marshall Plan .. the Truman Policy .. all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now, newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war-mongering Americans. I’d like to see one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplanes. Come on… let’s hear it!  Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar or the Douglas 107? If so, why don’t they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or women on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times … and safely home again. You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everyone to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, most of them … unless they are breaking Canadian laws..are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here. When the Americans get out of this bind … as they will… who could blame them if they said ‘the hell with the rest of the world’. Let someone else buy the Israel bonds, Let someone else build or repair foreign dams or design foreign buildings that won’t shake apart in earthquakes.  When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke. I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble?  I don’t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. Our neighbours have faced it alone and I am one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians.  And finally, the American Red Cross was told at its 48th Annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke. This year’s disasters .. with the year less than half-over… has taken it all and nobody…but nobody… has helped.  Gordon Sinclair"
I predict Obama will be implicated and exposed
"We have all members of Congress, House and Senate, state (under oath) whether they knew Hillary Clinton/DNC funded the Dossier, anything else obvious we decide to tack on.  Don't tell me the major movers and shakers of Dem Reps, were unaware that Hillary had turned the DNC into an extension of her campaign. They're the ones affected by fundraising decisions, and HIllary sucked up all the funding for all the lower local elections.  They knew something was up.  Start asking questions, and start prepping political nooses.  In this manner, they'll either be charged for lying under oath, or exposed as the liars they are for allowing this travesty to continue. (Looking at you, Cuckain)  Total win-win situation.  Spez: For instance, we know for a *fact* that Comey briefed members of Congress stating that GE Trump was NOT under investigation. Later it comes out Cuck Schumer, who was one of those briefed, had pushed ""Trump is under investigation.""  And yet, he was never forced to answer for his lies.  Zero tolerance for deep state and lefties."
"It's gonna take everything we've got, and even then, we'll still probably lose. But we *can't* just remain complacent. You've gotta be out there, every single day, waging this war of ideas, red pilling people, fighting against propaganda, and demanding that the few representatives we have in office actually *do something*.  We need to start the indictments soon. We don't have a lot of time. If the swamp is not mostly drained by 2018 and 2020, we're losing those elections too.  Marxism is not an ideology that waits and hopes. It goes and gets what it wants. And what have we been doing? Waiting and hoping."
"Tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up, take my kids to preschool, bebop my ass down to city hall and put a big giant checkmark beside Roy Moore's name. Just wanted to let you know."

"It's a psychological warfare tactic to cause restlessness to the masses susceptible to it.   Even if it's fake, the purpose is to keep planting these thoughts in people's heads... Causing a sense of ""Trump getting away with crimes"", a feeling of hopelessness leading to people wanting to redefine laws. Accusations = final verdicts. A settled court instead of innocent until proven guilty.   The deep state have made it to where it doesn't matter if it's true or false. You should just be mad until Trump is impeached.   CNN is stupid on the surface, but a psy op in intention. "
They aren't sending their best.
They have stolen many children with fabricated evidence only to wind up sending them to an abusive foster family which often leads to rape/murder of children! A lot of child trafficking in this country happens through the fostercare system!
"President Trump has mastered the concept of the Office of the President. Influence and make policy AND (in my opinion, one of the most important aspects) be THE number one cheerleader of the United States, rile us up, make us proud, and speak TO us. He absolutely nailed the speech yesterday. Neither Bush nor Obama ever made me feel this proud to be an American. "
We haven't seen or heard a peep from her in weeks.
"We shouldn't count illegals at all for 2020.  Many of the laws the Dems have put forward gives states like Cali more power because they have more people living there despite them having a huge percentage of illegals.  Funding is also divvied out to the states with the most people.  Delegates are also determined by the number if people in a state, not just citizens.  My proposal is to change the wording to ""how many US citizens reside at this address?"".   Do NOT ask how many people or in any way include illegals in the count.  If we do then the left will use those numbers to disapportionantly take from areas without illegals.  Couple that with voter ID, mandatory ID check for all employment (including contractors), and, of course, THE WALL, and we might yet save our country.  On another note the population of Mexico is 127 million people.  We have at least 10% of them here.   If they're such hard workers wouldn't Mexico be begging for them to come back?"
Notice the drumbeat for impeachment hitting a crescendo?   When are they going to wake up from the mass hysteria?

Earlier today they we're excited praising that Alabama may turn blue and change for the better. When not receiving what they want (so far) they cry and then just disrespect the entire state like they weren't praising Jones and Alabama earlier...
"Right on cue, LOL. They had the fall guy (Conyers, Franken), the documentary film maker backed by democrat money with a film about Trump's ""victims"" and a complicit media.  This folks, is how you create fake news and build fake outrage. "
Just got off the phone with a friend down in Alabama. She had just received a robo call from Sen Shelby disparaging Roy Moore and urging her to vote for Jones. She stated he would NEVER get her vote again. All you Alabama Pedes should light him up via email. Hopefully the Trump Curse will befall him.  https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/

"We've all heard about Hillary's loss-tour and how she's rationalizing her failure, but apparently Obama is joining her.  Since Obama has very little worth calling a legacy, **[he is now claiming to be the reason](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/6/thanks-obama-former-president-credits-himself-stro/?utm_source=onesignal&amp;utm_campaign=pushnotify&amp;utm_medium=push)** for our country's great economic success under President Trump's pro-business policies.   See here:  &gt; “As we took these actions, we saw the U.S. economy grow consistently,” Mr. Obama said. “We saw the longest streak of job creation in American history by far, ***a streak that still continues by the way.***”  &gt; He added wryly, “Thanks, Obama.”  ***  Incase any of you forgot--and stop me if you know where this is going--Obama had one of the worst records of economic performance in recent Presidential history (50+ years). Under President Obama and his policies, the U.S. economy and its citizens endured numerous downfalls, including a rise in 'wealth inequality', ironically enough... He even rationalized his failures by [redefining employment](http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/opinion/mini/mini-obama-administration-redefines-full-time-work/article_46cf9eae-fdaa-58f8-a8fa-1b51914b5be8.html) ([and he couldn't even make that look good](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/jobs-report-expect-to-be-disappointed-with-this-administration/)).    His record includes:   - [Claiming jobs can never be brought back, he literally mocked Trump for claiming that it is possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuhXkCF-L2E)   - [Garnering as little as 0.5% quarterly growth (Q4, 2015)](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2017/_images/gdp3q17_2nd_chart.png)   - [Pulled bottom 20% earners' income down by 7.6%](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/incomes-fall-and-poverty-rises-under-obama-census-report/)   [Pulled median household income down by 2.3%](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/incomes-fall-and-poverty-rises-under-obama-census-report/)   [Pushed number of those in the U.S. living in poverty up by 7.1%](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/incomes-fall-and-poverty-rises-under-obama-census-report/)  ***  All of this leaves us with a very simple conclusion: Barack Obama was inexperienced and, through that lack of experience, he failed to maintain a stable growth rate for his countrymen &amp; women to prosper.   The next conclusion, given that Obama is now claiming Trump's pro-business leadership and its respective success is all because of his (Obama's) policies, we can figure that he has little integrity and no shame in pivoting from his failures (e.g: *What Happened? Edition II*).  Unlike how President Obama redefined what employment means, he cannot redefine his performance. He also cannot redefine Trump's success as his own, and the more he tells these lies, the less the world will listen..thankfully enough."

"The DSM V calls it ""Fictitious Disorder Imposed on Another"".  Prior to that, the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children called the disorder ""Pediatric Condition Falsification.""  ""Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy"" was the first name of this condition and dates back four decades.  Essentially, a mentally I'll person, abuses a child to gain sympathy and attention for enduring such difficult situation as a chronically ill child.  Trans-acceptance allows these sick individuals to operate in the open, with no consequences for their abuse and no risk of killing the child until suicide as an adolescent."

"In my daughter's 8th grade social studies class, they formed a student government as part of one of their modules.  Prior to picking which political party to join they reviewed the ideas behind each party.  She said that after all of the students had picked the party they wanted to join, there were not enough students in the democrat party to ""form"" a government, so the teach forced some kids to change their party affiliation.  It makes me proud to know that there is a generation of kids coming up that can think for themselves and as of 8th grade are not bending to the wills of the education system."

"[C-SPAN Link](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4351026/clinton-1995-immigration-sotu)  *FULL TRANSCRIPT OF CLINTON'S IMMIGRATION SPEECH BELOW*  **BILL CLINTON** All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.  Isn't Politics Crazy?"

"My local county in Pa voted for trump 2:1. In a local election a month ago the democrat WON 2:1. That is because of interest/enthusiasm/get out the vote campaigns.

"...instead of being worried about being detained and interrogated about their son...  What's wrong with this picture?  **** Deport the families. Sell them to Qatar. IDGAF.  Give terrorists a reason not to martyr themselves if they know their families will be held responsible.   It's literally their culture. They care about tribal relations.  So in this instance, get multi-cultural. Learn their motivations in order to best intimidate them."

"Related and unrealted topic here... I saw 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' on opening night. It's taken me a couple of days to digest everything, but God DAMN. Liberalism has truly ruined Star Wars and is ruining this fantastic filmmaking medium on the grandest level. SPOILERS AHEAD.  After the SJW Awakens, I waited on with blind ignorance hoping that the next installment in the Star Wars series was going to dope. I was really eager to see the lore and knowledge of the Jedi and the Force be explained on a much deeper level. I could not wait to get to know more about this dark and mysterious figure, Supreme Leader Snoke. I was ecstatic that Luke Skywalker was going to be back! I was kept in wonder for 2 years. Wondering exactly was going to happen when Rey handed the over lightsaber that has been in Star Wars since it's inception..... And then, within a moments notice.. Everything that was once sacred was absolutely shit on (which I am seeing more and more now-a-days happen with everything that Libs touch). Anyways, Luke takes the saber and jus' fucking tosses the thing over his shoulder. Star Wars died for me in that moment.. I truly cannot fathom the day they shot that scene thinking that was a good idea.  Throughout this movie, it's riddled with very unecesarry jokes by just about every character. What the fuck? Why? What were the writers thinking? The first line is literally a joke. It's a conversation between Poe and Hux and it's a joke about a fucking phone line losing connection. Really? A 20th century phone line joke? Between this happening and Luke throwing his saber, I just knew the shitstorm was not over.  The characters all seem to have come straight from the pussy hat rally. I truly think there was some sort of deal in the Disney contract that stated there has to be a female hero with purple hair to appease the millennials, who look up to people with purple hair like they are some kind of SJW God. Christ... literally christ though. The only way Christ would be looked upon as having any redeeming qualities to these millennials is if he had purple hair (and turned a male into a female).   This movie is catered to these millennials who do nothing else but live in their comfortable bubble continuing to believe these fake fucking fairytales. The literal theme of this film even has to be spoon fed to the audience with the ever-so deep and meaningful quote by the funny quirky token Asian chick, ""That's how we're gonna win, not fighting what we hate, but saving what we love."" She could've literally said, ""Love Trumps Hate"", and that would've gotten the point of the movie across as well. Rose is pointless and so is that highly political driven side story at the casino planet.. cough cough.. very big undertones of political shit that's happening on EARTH is very evident during the whole side story. (This is severely purposeful, although from my point of view, it personally reminded me of Obama selling weapons to ISIS, which made me chuckle.)  There was so much that was shit on in this film. Hey, wanna know about Snoke? Nope, he dead after only a few mins of screen-time. Hey, wanna know about Rey's parents?? I meannn she did have some crazy ass fucking vision that featured Obi-Wan! She must be special! Nope! She just is some refugee. And hey! ALLLLL REFUGEES CAN BE JEDIS. (ALL REFUGEES CAN BE AMERICANS TOO). Wanna know about the Jedi and Sith? Nope, we are totally done with that shit. You can't be a JEDI or a SITH. EVERYONE CAN BE ONE. Fuck that sovereignty-esque shit right outta here! Oh, let's look at the white guys in this movie too. There must've been some sort of clause about white males in the future of Disney Star Wars movies cause it was literally like:  -Hux= evil bad guy, kinda like a NAZI  -Kylo Ren= has chance to be a nice white dude, BUT NO HE EVIL  -Snoke= (he white right?) - WELL HE EVIL TOO AND YOU DON'T GET TO EVEN KNOW WHO HE BE  Poe= Mansplaining stupid man... WOMEN KNOW BETTER THAN HIM!  Luke= hmmmm, it would be a shame if the only good white male character hero in StarWars were to now be a bitch and die out....  Admiral Ackbar= (for all intenets and purposes, let's say he's white) WELL, WE JUST GONNA MENTION HIM WITH A SIDE LINE THAT HE DEAD  Like jeez. Gimme a break. Don't even get me started on that Leia space floating shit. My oh my. They decide to not kill off the person that is literally dead in real life. That was the fucking plot twist of this film. It's eerily similar to Hillary just not shutting the fuck up and fucking off. This film is loaded with undertones.  Being the redpilled pede I am, I just really curious to see if others noticed this as well in this movie and others. It's truly sad that this is the state of film, and our once beloved Star Wars, but it seems to be the case. "
Until President Trump fires the leaders at FBI and DOJ and brings in two texas sheriffs to run them there wont be any justice.
"I get emails from the RNC and various related PACs as well as the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. Lots of them talk about being allied with Trump or supporting his agenda - but the fine print will say things like 'not associated with the Trump campaign' or 'Paid for by the RNC.' Even the Trump Make America Great Again Committee says 'Paid for by Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee authorized by and composed of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. and the Republican National Committee.'  So is the TMAGAC the best place for political donations to support Trump? I don't plan to give the RNC money until they start getting rid of the McCain, McConnell, Rubio, Ryan, etc.. types.  Also, are there other politicians as good as Rand Paul that are worthy of direct donations? I'm surprised there isn't a sticky with 'The_Donald' approved campaigns, PACs, etc.."

"The belief that all religions and cultural traditions are equally viable and good is wrong. It's akin to arguing that all viewpoints and ideas are respectable, valid, and have equal pragmatic value. That's just not true. You can be egalitarian and a humanist and reject multiculturalism as an ideal state of society. Freedom of speech and religion guaranteed by the first amendment of our constitution protects the freedom to hold and share ideas. It is not a guarantee of freedom from criticism or disagreement. Cultural traditions and beliefs should not be above criticism in a free society. Rejecting cultural/religious traditions as incompatible with American cultural values which promote barbaric practices such as female genital mutilation, pre-arranged child marriage, honor killings and religious law here in America is not mindless bigotry. It's completely different to hold someone accountable for their ideas and beliefs as opposed to their national origin or ethnicity. Immoral and unlawful discrimination is against factors which are controlled by circumstances of one's birth as opposed to ideas which are held voluntarily. Don't buy into politically correct culture being dictated by SJWs who try to convince you that you have to accept everyone else's ideas - or be labeled as a hateful bigot. You have the right to have your own ideas and reject and rebuke the one's you don't agree with in any circumstance - no matter if that hurts feelings or makes people feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. Don't compromise your own values in the name of cooperation while never receiving any reconciliation in return.    Just wanted to share."

"[Matthew 1:18-25 KJV] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.   Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.   But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.   Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS."
WOOOOOOOOOOOO.
"Also, this is fantastic for so many reasons. CNN and CBS independently publishing the same fake news? Obviously fed to them by the same source. Who is that source?

"I apologize for the generic title and following rant; however, it speaks for itself.  I'm referring to opening news reports with articles such as ""Gowdy gets PISSED at..."" or ""So-and-so SLAMS so-and-so...""  WHO GIVES A FUCK!?  When are we going to see real consequences for the actions that we're seeing come out of D.C. with the liberal corruption and bullshit?  'PISSED AT' doesn't cut it.  If I fuck up even a fraction of what's been brought to light as Hillary, the CIA, the FBI... I don't get heavy words thrown at me by a judge or prosecutor and then go on about my life... I get jailed immediately before bonded and a court date set, I lose my job, my family likely loses our house, my car would get impounded after being pulled over and taken into custody, I get sentenced, I lose my life's savings with attorney fees and/or bailing out, I have to go through the legal process of trying to save my ass, likely get locked up, probably lose my marriage, definitely lose my freedom.  I'll lose EVERYTHING that was fucking important to me.  Meanwhile, these politicians are making millions, getting their hand slapped for things they should immediately be serving DECADES (at least) of hard time for, articles about endless-investigations going no-where even though if half the evidence against them were against me I'd be fucked!  And fuck any liberal coming in with the Russian collusion bullshit, or sexual misconduct.  BOTH of those are nearly 100% hear-say, some with 'victims' coming out of the forest decades later with just accusations w/ deeper agendas going on behind the scenes (politically motivated, being paid, etc.)  I'm talking about REAL criminal activity with REAL evidence already brought to light.  I'm talking about the DNC, Hillary, the FBI, the CIA, etc.  So please spare us w/ the 'but... but...' smoke and mirrors bullshit.  Also, T_D... please spare the 'IT'S HAPPENING...' titles I see plaguing the subreddit (it's just as bad).  Nothing is happening.  Nothing has happened after years of this crap.

Somebody tell me how these so-called black or urban radio stations that claim to be all about the community can advertise predatory lenders like We Fix Money or Money Mutual.   These so-called lenders keep desperate poor people poor and desperate with their 800% interest on $500-1000 loans.   You borrow $500 and they charge you the 500 plus an additional $700-900 even if you pay it back on your next check.   **Yet these same stations that are telling you that the new tax plan is bad for black folks have no problem advertising these predators to those same black folks they claim to serve.**

"So, if you look in my post history, I’ve spoken about a publications class I’m in. I design my schools yearbook. I just recently finished my first page, got the grade back, and it said 70%. I  was ticked! I asked the mentor (Not teacher, as she doesn’t teach.) what happened, and she said it wasn’t good enough. I did everything she asked, just to appease her, and it still came back poor. I did a bit of digging and it turns out she’s a YUUUGE liberal. I’ll link he twitter feed if you guys wanna have some fun. Ask for it in the comments. I went back to my home-screen on my iPad and I saw her instantly shoot me a dirty look. I was so pleased, and I’m not even upset about the grade.

"Proof:  * Massive spike in absentee ballots before the election.  * LESS Republican turnout in a literally worthless race. 100k+ more Republicans showed up to vote for Jeff Sessions when he ran UNOPPOSED.  * College students caught on camera admitting they came from out-of-state to influence the election.  * Blacks, who rarely EVER vote for a candidate who is not also black, somehow turned out in droves and supported a rich old white man. More Alabama blacks turned out for this vote than for Obama's elections.  * 92% Democrat turnout (**SPEZ:** 92% of 2016 votes, still very unlikely) and a victory owed to the black vote. I thought they were being suppressed by voter ID?  * Alabama legalized the destruction of digital votes THE DAY OF MOORE'S LOSS.  * Several Trump counties totally turned around to support Jones.

Will the individual mandate be repealed with the current tax bill sorry it's hard to keep up with this shit
"**The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1)** overhauls America’s tax code to deliver historic tax relief for workers, families and job creators, and revitalize our nation’s economy[.](http://i.magaimg.net/img/24ho.jpg) By lowering taxes across the board, eliminating costly special-interest tax breaks, and modernizing our international tax system, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help create more jobs, increase paychecks, and make the tax code simpler and fairer for Americans of all walks of life.     With this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of **$2,059**.     **For individuals and families, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:**     • Lowers individual taxes and sets the rates at 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% so people can keep more of their hard-earned money.     • **Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year** from taxes – from $6,500 and $13,000 under current law to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married couples, respectively.     • Continues to allow people to write off the cost of state and local taxes – up to $10,000. Gives individuals and families the ability to deduct property taxes and income – or sales – taxes to best fit their unique circumstances.     • Takes action to support more American families by:     • **Expanding the Child Tax Credit** from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. The tax credit is fully refundable up to $1,400 and begins to phase-out for families making over $400,000. Parents must provide a child’s valid Social Security Number in order to receive this credit.     • Preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families care for their children and older dependents such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support.     • Preserving the Adoption Tax Credit so parents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open their hearts and homes to an adopted child.     • Preserves the mortgage interest deduction – providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners.     • For all homeowners with existing mortgages that were taken out to buy a home, there will be **no change** to the current mortgage interest deduction.     • For homeowners with new mortgages on a **first or second home**, the home mortgage interest deduction will be available up to $750,000.     • **Provides relief for Americans with expensive medical bills by expanding the medical expense deduction for 2017 and 2018 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, and rising to 10 percent beginning in 2019.**     • Continues and expands the deduction for charitable contributions so people can continue to donate to their local church, charity, or community organization.     • **Eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax** – providing families with much-needed relief and flexibility to buy the health care that’s right for them if they choose.     • Maintains the Earned Income Tax Credit to provide important tax relief for low-income Americans working to build better lives for themselves.     • Improves savings vehicles for education by allowing families to use 529 accounts to save for elementary, secondary and higher education.     • Provides support for graduate students by continuing to exempt the value of reduced tuition from taxes.     • **Retains popular retirement savings options** such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) so Americans can continue to save for their future.     • Increases the exemption amount from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to reduce the complexity and tax burden for millions of Americans.     • Provides immediate relief from the Death Tax by doubling the amount of the current exemption to reduce uncertainty and costs for many family-owned farms and businesses when they pass down their life’s work to the next generation.     **For job creators of all sizes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:**     • Lowers the corporate tax rate to 21% (beginning Jan. 1, 2018) – down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world – the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation’s history.     **• Delivers significant tax relief to Main Street job creators by:**     • Offering a **first-ever** 20% tax deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income earned by all businesses organized as S corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships. For Main Street job creators with income above this level, the bill generally provides a deduction for up to 20% on business profits – reducing their effective marginal tax rate to no more than 29.6%.     • Establishing strong safeguards so that wage income does not receive the lower marginal effective tax rates on business income – helping to ensure that Main Street tax relief goes to the local job creators it was designed to help most.     • Allows businesses to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment to improve operations and enhance the skills of their workers – unleashing growth of jobs, productivity, and paychecks.     • Protects the ability of small businesses to write off interest on loans, helping these Main Street entrepreneurs start or expand a business, hire workers, and increase paychecks.     • Preserves important elements of the existing business tax system, including:     • Retaining the low-income housing tax credit that encourages businesses to invest in affordable housing so families, individuals, and seniors can find a safe and comfortable place to call home.     • Preserving the Research &amp; Development Tax Credit that encourages our businesses and workers to develop cutting-edge **“Made in America”** products and services.     • Retaining the tax-preferred status of private-activity bonds that are used to finance valuable infrastructure projects.     • Eliminates the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, thereby lowering taxes and eliminating confusion and uncertainty so American job creators can focus on growing their business and hiring more workers, rather than on burdensome paperwork.     • Modernizes our international tax system so America’s global businesses will no longer be held back by an outdated “worldwide” tax system that results in double taxation for many of our nation’s job creators.     • Makes it easier for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities.     • Prevents American jobs, headquarters, and research from moving overseas by eliminating incentives that now reward companies for shifting jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants abroad.     **For greater American energy security and economic growth, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:**     • Establishes an environmentally responsible oil and gas program in the non-wilderness 1002 Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Congress specifically set aside the 1.57-million acre 1002 Area for potential future development. Two lease sales will be held over the next decade and surface development will be limited to 2,000 federal acres – just one ten-thousandth of all of ANWR.     • Significantly boosts American energy production. Responsible development in the 1002 Area will raise tens of billions of dollars for deficit reduction in the decades to come, while creating thousands of new jobs, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and helping to keep energy affordable for American families and businesses.     • Provides a temporary increase in offshore revenue sharing for the Gulf Coast in 2020 and 2021, allowing those states to invest in priorities such as coastal restoration and hurricane protection.

"Smelled something awful, and to my surprise its Podesta waiting online at customs UK. Avoiding all eye contact... what a scumbag."
I really like Ben Carson. He seems like a cool knowledgeable dude. I was glad Trump gave him a Administration seat. I just wanted to know how he’s doing and any news on this? I believe he’s on Make America Great Again train! 
"Went to a movie with my Mexican friend of 7 years. We live in Los Angeles, everyone is Liberal of course. We stopped talking about politics when he lost his shit on Facebook when I told everyone I was no longer a Bernie supporter, but now a Trump supporter. (Around August after bullshit Charlottesville dumbness.) We were both diehard Bernie supporters and hated Hillary. I slowly red pilled for a year after the election as he doubled down and tripled down on the Liberal insanity. He even started thinking that Donald Trump was a Russian spy.   He literally threw a conniption fit for all of our friends to see on Facebook when I came out as a Trump supporter. Later that week, he went on a rant about how white people are the only ones prospering in America. (He makes 70k a year and has two BMWs, no college education. Got hired by a white liberal with white guilt.)  Him and his black friend went on a “You don’t understand cause your white” rant at me. I blocked and deleted them both.    Anyways his girlfriend who’s non-political got us back together as friends and we just don’t talk about politics. Anyways that didn’t last long and we started lightly talking about our opinions on the way to a movie. I think his girlfriend held her breath as she listened. Anyways what I noticed after talking to him, and other times really, is that he has all the standard talking points that seem to be straight from a late night liberal comedy show.   Like with the kneeling at football games.   He says “Do you stand at your house for the flag at football games?”  I say  “No, do you kneel?”  Just stupid shit I know he’s getting from liberal Facebook videos which is ALL pretty much Facebook is anymore.   It’s so easy for me to shut him up, it’s like these people do not think these things through. They just watch the Facebook video, and assume it’s right and don’t think anything else about it.   He even tried to tell me that illegals don’t take high paying jobs, when his roommate is illegal and he makes 100k a year. Like how can you push a Liberal talking point when you know from first hand experience it’s not true?  I stop him in his tracks with stuff like this, and it’s like he never even thought of his roommate who’s illegal. Like how can you see a Liberal talking point, know it’s NOT true from first hand experience, and still say it like a robot?  The Democrats seem to have some kind of magic spell on people, and it’s coming from the TV.  "
"The caller said that Mueller is witch-hunting Trump to gain enough public trust(by dems) to turn the investigation around at the end and arrest all the criminals, clintons included.  Only someone who looks like they're so against Trump, could credibly go after them without a revolt.  Jeff Sessions' recusal and Trump associate indictments is only to give Mueller more credibility.  Caller believes that Mueller was called in by Trump and given a choice to either go down with them, or to cooperate with their investigation of the FBI."

"1. Follow Bill Priestap.  2. Bill Priestap is the FBI Director of Counterintelligence.  3. Bill Priestap was the immediate supervisor of FBI Counterintelligence Deputy Peter Strzok . Priestap is #1, Strzok was #2.  4. The investigation into candidate Donald Trump was a counterintelligence operation. That operation began in July 2016. Bill Priestap would have been in charge of that, along with all other, FBI counterintelligence operations.  5. FBI Deputy Peter Strzok was specifically in charge of the Trump counterintel op. However, Strzok would be reporting to Bill Priestap on every detail and couldn't (according to structure anyway) make a move without Priestap approval.  6. On March 20th 2017 congressional testimony, James Comey was asked why the FBI Director did not inform congressional oversight about the counterintelligence operation that began in July 2016. [https://youtu.be/HlXXZQgh72Y](https://youtu.be/HlXXZQgh72Y)  7. Director Comey said he did not tell congressional oversight he was investigating presidential candidate Donald Trump because the Director of Counterintelligence suggested he not do so. *Very important detail.* [https://youtu.be/HlXXZQgh72Y](https://youtu.be/HlXXZQgh72Y)  8. I cannot emphasize this enough. *VERY* important detail. Again, notice how Comey doesn't use Priestap's actual name, but refers to his position and title. Again, watch  [https://youtu.be/HlXXZQgh72Y](https://youtu.be/HlXXZQgh72Y)  9. FBI Director James Comey was caught entirely off guard by that first three minutes of questioning. He simply didn't anticipate it.  10. Oversight protocol requires the FBI Director to tell the congressional intelligence ""Gang of Eight"" of any counterintelligence operations. The Go8 has oversight into these ops at the highest level of classification. At the time it was this group: Ryan, Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell, Burr, Feinstein, Schiff &amp; Nunes.    11. Based on what we know, and what has surfaced recently, we can all see why the FBI would want to keep it hidden that they were running a counterintelligence operation against a presidential candidate. As FBI Agent Peter Strzok said it was an ""insurance policy"".  12: FBI Agent Strzok to FBI Attorney Page: ""I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office that there’s no way he gets elected – but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”   12 (b). ""Insurance Policy"" text link FBI agent's anti-Trump text messages released to Congress A series of text messages exchanged between top FBI employees referring to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump as an ""idiot"" and ""d*uche,"" while fearing... [Texts](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/12/12/politics/peter-strzok-texts-released/index.html?__twitter_impression=true)  13. So James Comey is telling congress that the reason he didn't inform the statutory oversight ""Gang of Eight"" was because Bill Priestap (Director of Counterintelligence) recommended he didn't do it.  14. That's called creating a ""fall guy"". FBI Director James Comey is ducking responsibility in March 2017 by blaming FBI Director of Counterintelligence Bill Priestap for not informing congress of the operation that began in July 2016. (9 months prior).  15. At that moment, that very specific moment during that hearing, anyone who knows how these things roll could see Comey was creating his own exit from getting ensnared in the consequences from the wiretapping and surveillance operation of President Donald Trump.  16. Bill Priestap is James Comey's shield from liability.  17. There has been NO MENTION of Bill Priestap in any of the recent revelations, despite his centrality to all of it.  18. Bill Priestap would have needed to authorize Peter Strzok to engage with Christopher Steele over the ""Russian Dosssier"".  19. Bill Priestap would have needed to approve of the underlying documents that were used for both FISA applications (June/July and Sept/Oct).  20. Bill Priestap would be the person to approve of paying, or reimbursing, Christopher Steele for the Russian Dossier used in their counterintelligence operation and subsequent FISA application.  21. Without Bill Priestap involved, approvals, etc. the entire Russian/Trump Counterintelligence operation doesn't happen. Comey's testimony is also evidence of Priestap's importance.  22. In addition, when Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates testified (w/ James Clapper), she too spoke of the important of Priestap as her liaison and contact within the FBI on the counterintelligence operation. [Yates never mentioned Peter Strzok - not once.]  23. Even though it was FBI agent Peter Strzok who interviewed Michael Flynn on January 24th, [link below] Sally Yates never mentioned him. EVER. FBI supervisor removed from Special Counsel's Office had interviewed Michael Flynn - Sara A. Carter “The most logical thing to happen would be to call the other FBI Special Agent present during Flynn’s interview before the Grand Jury to recount his version,” said a former U.S. Intelligence Official… [Flynn Interview](saraacarter.com/2017/12/04/fbi-supervisor-removed-from-special-counsels-office-had-interviewed-michael-flynn/)  24. However Deputy AG Sally Yates did talk about Bill Priestap during her testimony.  25. Yates said she and Bill Priestap traveled together, Jan  26th, to the White House to inform Don McGhan (WH Counsel) of Michael Flynn ""misleading statements"" (based on Pence media reports and Flynn prior ambush interview Jan 24th).  26. According to Sally Yates testimony, she and Bill Priestap reportedly presented all the information to McGahn so the White House could take action that they deemed appropriate.  27. So you can see that Bill Priestap is a central figure. Comey defers to him; Yates relied on him; Strzok reports to him; etc.  28. Yet there's no mention of Bill Priestap in any of the explosive investigative story-lines in the past two weeks. Why?  29. Bill Priestap is FBI Director of Counterintelligence. There's no way he hasn't been caught inside the investigative net.  30. Priestap's boss, Andrew McCabe has been caught. His subordinate, Peter Strzok, has most certainly been caught. And previously FBI Director Comey pushed him in front of the bus.  31. Either Priestap is going to be the attempted fall-guy for the entire scheme.  -OR-  Bill Priestap saw the bus coming and is assisting the scheme investigators    [Link](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/941585613089857536.html) "

"Politicians of all persuasion make promises at the drop of a hat.  It's how they lie to constituencies to get elected.  As their terms in office roll along, the promises are largely left unfulfilled.  The assumption, and usual course of things, is that the voters will simply forget.  And that assumption almost always is correct.    Donald Trump made what most would consider ""wild promises"" to get elected.  There's no way any ""normal politician"" could ever even come close to doing what he said.  Now the GOP, the country, and the whole world are waking up to something new.  It's unheard of.  It upsets the natural order.  Donald J. Trump is THE PRESIDENT WHO KEEPS HIS PROMISES!!!  HOPE was the punchline to the joke that was Obama.    HOPE is our new reality.   "

"Why? because the information processing sector is rapidly maturing and capital is desprity looking for the next big thing..Turn's out the next big thing is actually going to be Big things...Bridges, aqueducts dams, tunnels, power plants,rail lines and  and infrastructure of all types that will feed a manufacturing resurgence in America and other developed economies.   Our infrastructure along with other mature and developed economies is actually pretty freaking old and not up to feeding enormous  highly automated manufacturing facilities of tomorrow. These manufacturing complexes will need lots of affordable power along with fast and efficient transportation networks..All this add's up to massive infrastructure development both in the private ans public sector.."
"Ok, so maybe a bit of hyperbole.  But for us Reagan Republicans that have been chafing for 40 years over this issue, it feels good man. I know, the first barrel is still probably years away, but remember how speculative the oil market is.  It will contribute to the lowering of oil futures and alleviate some of the high costs of energy in this country now, and even more later when the oil starts to flow.  With that one little rider or order, whichever it was, GEOTUS has positioned the US to be the dominant economy on the planet for decades to come.  The environmental concerns were probably valid 50 years ago, but modern technology, practices, and regulation has rendered that point moot.  I could go on about lowering the cost of living and doing business, but we'll see more in the months and years to come.  The markets go up and down and the economy is always cyclical, but were in for a decades long boom the likes of which hasn't been seen in 70 years.    EDIT: ANWR-I'm dumb."

"This basically amounts to a cross-post, but I am afraid that it might go unseen on the original subreddit. Net Neutrality has seen a lot of talk recently, and much misinformation. I hope this can help clear up the topic for some people, and explain as to why Ajit Pai should be *supported*.  (Cross-post begins) I think it is important say this, as the entire conversation around NN has been a huge shit show of misinformation. People **need** to see this post, as I explain an otherwise lengthy document in a succinct, and reassuring manner.    **The bill to repeal Net Neutrality is great, and actually ensures that ISPs can not place priorities on higher paying customers versus lower paying customers.**   [Here is the ruling, which is about 210 pages long.](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)   Why would anybody want the **government**, especially one where you can go from a liberal like Barack Obama, to a populist like Donald Trump, to hold **more** control over the internet? The same government which has agencies that misuse it to unconstitutionally spy on it's people? Whether you like Donald Trump, or you liked Barack Obama, you did not/do not like the government under one of them, and more power for them means they can use it abuse and misuse. Now, complete power to ISPs who just want to make $$$ is not a great idea either, as they are willing to do whatever to make more money, right? So we need a ***hybrid*** with limited gov't (but meaningful) control, and that allows the free market to guide the internet in the direction *we want*. A system where abuses can be fixed, but that also avoids heavy handed control under *constantly changing* administrations.   Excerpt 1: &gt; Consequently, Title II regulation is an unduly heavy-handed approach to what at worst are relatively minor problems. Although the Title II Order argued that ISPs were incentivized to harm edge innovation, it also conceded that ISPs benefit from the openness of the Internet. The Title II Order found that “when a broadband provider acts as a gatekeeper, it actually chokes consumer demand for the very broadband product it can supply.” We agree. The content and applications produced by edge providers often complement the broadband Internet access service sold by ISPs, and ISPs themselves recognize that their businesses depend on their customers’ demand for edge content. It is therefore no surprise that many ISPs have committed to refrain from blocking or throttling lawful Internet conduct notwithstanding any Title II regulation. **Finally, to the extent these economic forces fail in any particular situation, existing consumer protection and antitrust laws additionally protect consumers. We therefore find that Title II, and the attendant utility-style regulation of ISPs, are an unnecessarily heavy-handed approach to protecting Internet openness.**  Excerpt 2:  &gt; In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that harms Internet openness, despite the paucity of evidence of such incidents, we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address such conduct. Other legal regimes—particularly antitrust law and the FTC’s authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices—provide protection for consumers. These long established and well-understood antitrust and consumer protection laws are well-suited to addressing any openness concerns, because they apply to the whole of the Internet ecosystem, including edge providers, thereby avoiding tilting the playing field against ISPs and causing economic distortions by regulating only one side of business transactions on the Internet.  Excerpt 3: &gt; Today’s reclassification of broadband Internet access service restores the FTC’s authority to enforce any commitments made by ISPs regarding their network management practices that are included in their advertising or terms and conditions, as the FTC did so successfully in FTC v. TracFone. The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable. The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.” Today’s reclassification also restores the FTC’s authority to take enforcement action against unfair acts or practices. An unfair act or practice is one that creates substantial consumer harm, is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers, and that consumers could not reasonably have avoided.  Excerpt 4: &gt; Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per se illegal under the antitrust laws. Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which applies if a firm possesses or has a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power, prohibits exclusionary conduct, which can include refusals to deal and exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, and vertical restraints. Section 2 makes it illegal for a vertically integrated ISP to anticompetitively favor its content or services over unaffiliated edge providers’ content or services.   Excerpt 5: &gt; Most of the examples of net neutrality violations discussed in the Title II Order could have been investigated as antitrust violations. Madison River Communications blocked access to VoIP to foreclose competition to its telephony business; an antitrust case would have focused on whether the company was engaged in anticompetitive foreclosure to preserve any monopoly power it may have had over telephony. Whether one regards Comcast’s behavior toward BitTorrent as blocking or throttling, it could have been pursued either as an antitrust or consumer protection case. The Commission noted that BitTorrent’s service allowed users to view video that they might otherwise have to purchase through Comcast’s Video on Demand service a claim that would be considered an anticompetitive foreclosure Comcast also failed to disclose this network management practice and initially denied that it was engaged in any throttling—potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices. **If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix), that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.**  Excerpt 6: &gt; We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to **extravagant statutory power over the national economy** while at the same time strenuously asserting that the authority claimed would render the 'statute unrecognizable to the Congress that designed’ it.”  Excerpt 7: &gt; We also reject AT&amp;T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order. Although AT&amp;T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification,” we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures unnecessary.    Summarized ( **tl;dr**)  * Excerpt 1: The FCC argues that the free market ultimately means that ISPs are going to be financially discouraged from actually hurting the supply of internet access that they provide. Despite this argument, they also add that even if they do throttle speeds, consumer protection laws and anti-trust laws will take over in this case and allow for any wrongs to be made right.  * Excerpt 2: The FTC's power is multivaried, and can ensure that ISPs *and* edge providers (facebook, twitter, youtube, reddit, ect.) are also open to appropriate regulation, so as to avoid unfairly tilting regulation towards ISPs. IMO, this is beneficial as it moves us closer, albeit not significantly, to extending the 1st amendment to the internet.  * Excerpt 3: Basically, ISPs commercials, advertising and Terms and Conditions can not be deceptive, as to do so would fall under unfair-and-deceptive practices and open the ISP to suit by the FTC. They also provide a definition for an ""unfair act"" which is, ""An unfair act or practice is one that creates substantial consumer harm, is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers, and that consumers could not reasonably have avoided.""  * Excerpt 4: Section 1 of the Sherman Act would make throttling or limiting of specific applications illegal, would therefore open an ISP to a suit and is stated by the FCC. Section 2 of the Sherman Act would adequately restrain large corporations like Comcast from favoring it's content over another companies through it's power as an ISP.   * Excerpt 5: Multiple examples are given as to how the FTC could sue companies over activities like throttling. Also, the FCC states that throttling of services like Netflix (literally named) could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.  * Excerpt 6: The FCC states that putting the internet directly into the control of the FCC would give the government control of a significant part of the economy, extravagantly so, and modifies the original piece of legislation to an unrecognizable nature.  * Excerpt 7: AT@T asked the FCC to promise to never bring back Net Neutrality, and make it so that a future FCC can not do it. The FCC is saying fuck off, and that if the FCC wants they can bring back Title II, or Net Neutrality if necessary, meaning that on the off chance that this all goes to hell, Title II can be brought back."

"http://menslaws.com/index.php/trump-tax-bill-eliminates-alimony-deduction-another-big-reason-avoid-marriage-get-divorced-december-31-2018/  The tax bill will pretty much eliminate alimony deductions. That means that divorced men who cannot afford to pay alimony/child support any longer will never have a chance to decrease their alimony payments. If they can't afford to pay it, they'll just be thrown in jail. Simple, yet terrifying. Men will be the true victims. I'm a gay man, and I hate seeing straight males getting screwed over again and again by the divorce laws in this country.  I mean, think of it. 50% of marriages in the United States end in divorce. 80% of them are initiated by the wife. And 90% of the time, the husband is the one who is kicked to the curb and forced to lose contact with his own children. There are many men out there who are struggling to pay alimony and child support. And with this tax plan, they'll be stuck with the same struggle and will no longer attempt to escape it.  And furthermore, I see this as another rational reason why straight men are avoiding marriage and relationships altogether. Because some lawmakers have no clue that this will give marriage an even worse reputation than ever before. Men see it as a bad investment, and will stick with the bachelor life for the rest of their lives. I'm not saying that being a bachelor is a bad thing (hell, I see a lot of good things about it, too). But the low birth rates and the distrust between men and women will continue to grow.  If the lawmakers see the light and change this one thing in Trump's tax plan, then it's a good start to changing the divorce laws in this country. I'm sick of seeing ex-husbands being used and abused by the system."

"Fellow pedes, I’ve been doing some thinking and I’ve come up with a bit of a theory I want to walk y’all through. At this point, we know two things for certain.   1. Hezbollah has been involved in drug running coke and other drugs into America to help fund their operations. Nothing about this has been even remotely disputed at any level, I’m going to assume it’s fact.   2. In fairly recent years, there has been an increase in overdoses that have been caused by whatever drug being cut with fentanyl. This is indisputable as well.   From there, I’m no expert, but the fatal dose of fentanyl is incredibly small to my understanding when cut with other drugs. The consensus of everything I’ve read, here on this dom, among other subs like [redacted] and others, and anywhere else, is that whoever is doing this has to know it’s fatal, and is basically evil/ doing it to kill people. Given that Hezbollah is known for wanting to kill Americans, I don’t think it’s a stretch at all to think that Hezbollah is the group that is primarily introducing fentanyl into the drug supply. I haven’t compared any data regarding the rise of these overdoses vs when the investigation believes Hezbollah got into the drug game or any other dates, but if the dates line up, especially with the signing of the Iran deal, that would be serious evidence that I’m right in Hezbollah being the ones cutting the drugs and that the reports regarding Obama including that investigation in the negotiation of the Iran deal. I’m not going to say I’m right until I see data or Session’s investigation says so, but until then these are definitely things that should be asked. Let me know what y’all think. "

And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

"Edward Snowden is an NSA Leaker and Whistleblower who did not share anything that put Americans at risk with respect to any other nation.

What they did was wrong.  Some think what he did was wrong.

If you said ""Google is CIA"" it would be as correct as saying ""AT&amp;T is the NSA"" given that AT&amp;T has a vast windowless skyscraper that is a giant computer at 33 Thomas Street in NYC called 'titanpoint' which is a joint center where NSA can monitor all domestic phone calls via Echelon/Fiveeyes  Google is the publisher of Android, a linux based phone OS, and the only official way to install apps is through the Google marketplace.  (There are ways around this but they involve decreasing the 'official' security of the phone OS)  Google can choose what apps are 'secure' or 'safe' enough to install  If Google allows Edward Snowden, a security Asylee in Russia, who is in asylum for domestic espionage, then you really have to question the relationship between Google and Edward Snowden, don't you?   It would beg the question, why doesn't Google-CIA care about Snowden releasing an app on their system, unless Snowden is really still part of the US intelligence Community  This question is all the more important because Snowden is in Russia--allegedly--which means that we really don't know what relationships Snowden has developed in Russia--if any--or whether he even developed that app or is simply smacking his own ""Brand"" on it for authenticity.  In fact, if one wanted to spy on Americans on behalf of Russia, then a Snowden-branded Russian app would be the perfect resource to do so.  Even if it were 'open source' the cloud service providers that our data could potentially be routed to could be those that are monitored by Russia; even if those were in the US.  There are many things that are not known about this app, and many reasons to question it.  So, in conclusion, IF google allows you to install this app, and IF you install this app carelessly, then it's proof that you have no more right to complain about Russian Spying--this app would come from a Russian spy.    OK, so quit your BS leftists.  You can't have it both ways.  Just because it is convenient to you, you cannot ""not care"" about security because--to your antinational mind--you ""Live in Global Now"" and so Snowden is just some kind of Global hero to you that you trust 100% because he gave you a PDF that made you distrust the action of your government; while at the same time, whine about this *apparently mythical* nation-state of 1960s RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA gonna hack you and your momma as some kind of advanced-persistent-threat.  Not only is that a cognitive dissonance, it's also shitbrained.  AND ITS ALSO RACIST. America needs you to wake up and use your brain for maybe the first time in your adult lives.  We cannot deal with your shit anymore.  OK?  Sorry not sorry  --- 911bodysnatchers322 -- 12/26/2017"
Why the heck does this stupid show start with President Trump speaking? I don't get tv any more. That's why I don't watch that crap.
"Tel them to calculate their future earning with previous tax plan, subtract the amount they have to pay with the new tax plan. Donate that to a charity of their choice. Tell them to put their wallet where their mouth is or stfu."
"Here it is in a nutshell.   Hollywood behind the camera is a nest of rapists, pedophiles, and assorted degenerate perverts who use their positions as gatekeepers to fame and fortune as a way to force whatever their particular perversion is on mostly beautiful young girls although the homosexuals participate equally so no one is immune.   This is a system of hazing that ensures no one outside their moral level will rise above them.   Three kinds of ""victims"" exist. The first are those who were subjected to these perversions and tried to expose them when they happened over the last few decades. You don't know who these people are because they never got famous and the police organization with jurisdiction over this is the LAPD, a paramilitary organization used to keep poor people out of Beverly Hills and protect the film industry.   The second type of victim are the ones who begrudgingly or happily  allowed and participated in the perversions to get famous, but their star has faded and they desperately need attention. Nasty Judd is their leader.   The third type of victims are a group that were subjected to Hollywood perverts, didn't willingly participate, understood what the LAPD really is, got famous anyway, and now looking back we can see the clues they left in their work and interviews.   Reminder, Barack Obama got his daughter an internship at the Weinstien Company before leaving office. Worst. Dad. Ever.   Danny Masterson ""It's not rape if it's your girlfriend."" No response from Mila Kunis or Laura Pepron, noted fem-nazis, on file yet.  Projection for 2018: more of the same, Hollywood is dying."
"People are so confused about NN.  my family's instincts were correct, but I'm glad they come to me as the wise sage.  Pizzagate is a shocker.  But I show them the hot tub email and say imagine for one second that was received by Steve Bannon.    My BASED dad still does not buy the medical boot covering Hillary and McCain's ankle monitors.   Now I understand the strategy of a slow redpilling I feel is starting via Mueller SC.  "
"Lowest movie ticket sales in decades. Worst NFL ratings and attendance in years.   Booming economy with best Christmas spending in decades.    We are winning because small decisions make large impacts. We don't need guides or direction, only following our own moral compass can we shape our reality, family, community, and nation.   MAGA is not a slogan, it's a lifestyle."
The media are a failure. 
"From the crappy cafeteria food to student loans,  we made the hashtag #thanksobama for all the messed up things that were going on, to the point where EVERYTHING that was wrong from world events to daily lives, we shit on Obama.  So don’t let these same people crown Obama as some sort of savior when we were bashing him."

"&gt; “When they were questioning me, it seemed like they were still trying to get a feel of the basic landscape of the place,” said one witness who was questioned in late October for several hours and, like others, requested anonymity to describe the confidential sessions. **“I didn’t get the sense they had anything incriminating on the president. Nor were they anywhere close to done.”**"
Get to the back of the line !
I just heard someone say that the Mueller investigation is looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and people associated with Russia such as WikiLeaks. How far back in the fake news cycle do you have to go to relate Wikileaks to Russia. Disgusting
"In the house plan, I lose about $5k.   In the senate plan, I gain about 5k.   Assuming those balance out, I will not receive a tax break.  I am in a medium-level tax state.    This is perfectly ok with me. This tax bill isn’t designed for me.  It is designed to help those working their way up the ladder, and to strongly stimulate the economy and create and recapture jobs.  Once again, Trump was a man of his word.  Had I come out much better off under this plan, I would have been happy at the extra money but I would have had to wonder for the first time if Trump was being honest in his pledges or was just saying one thing to the populace at large while winking to the wealthy.    Just want to reassure fellow ‘pedes.   The middle class focus of this tax plan is not some trick.  My situation is proof of that.    I have retirement investments that, assuming the economy continues to do well under Trump, will ultimately make me a winner under this plan as well.  But it is time for the hollowed out middle class see tangible increase in their buying power and opportunities.    I couldn’t be prouder of Trump!   "

I think Flynn is just trying to save face for his family. He even said in court that he did not commit treason which collusion would have been considered.
It's at 913 days. That's when I am eligible to retire and trust me I am gone from this craphole.
Flynn is going to testify against Trump and they could replace Trump with Bernie. Is this being paranoid? 
According to what we know from msm.  Trump cabinet tells Flynn to call the Russians. Flynn calls the Russians. Flynn is wiretapped/leaked that he talked to Russians. Trump cabinet learns that he had lied to them (Pence) about talking to Russians. Flynn gets fired. This doesn't make sense because Flynn is saying that Trump officials told him to speak with the Russsians. But when Trump officials asked him if he spoke with the Russians he lied and said no. Dafuq?

Seriously. The mental gymnastics the left is doing is sad at this point. When will they let go that America elected Donald J. Trump to be not just be president - but their favorite president?
"If healthcare, education, and infrastructure are important to liberals, then they will really like Trump’s policies.   For example, on healthcare, Trump asked Congress to focus on five principles when replacing the Affordable Care Act.  1.  Ensuring people with pre-existing health conditions are guaranteed access to health insurance, ""and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in health-care exchanges.  2.  Giving people who buy their own health coverage tax credits and expanded health savings accounts to help pay for their coverage, as well as flexibility about the design of their plans.  3. Give states ""the resources and flexibility"" in their Medicaid programs ""to make sure no one is left out.""  4.  Legal reforms to protect doctors and patients ""from unnecessary costs"" that drive up insurance costs, and to bring down the price of high-cost drugs.  5.  Creating a national insurance marketplace that allows insurers to sell health plans across state lines, to make healthcare more affordable.   These are outstanding principles, and they are not decisively “Republican” principles.   With regard to education, Trump has proposed $20 million in grants for poor children to ensure greater choice for kids to attend a magnet school, a charter school, or a public or a private school.  Furthermore, he has said he believes poorer families should be able to choose from among these school types, just like other families.   Finally, his proposals regarding rebuilding America’s infrastructure are well known.  He wants to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.   These are great ideas, fairly consistent with REASONABLE, liberal values.  (Not modern, “Reeeeeing Liberals.” Just liberals.)  The notion that Schumer and Pelosi won’t lead the Dems to work with Trump to pass this stuff is perplexing and frustrating.  He has demonstrated a willingness to reach across the aisle, but they are not interested in horse trading for the betterment of the folks Trump wants to help.  They would rather see Trump lose than Americans win.   Hopefully he will find a way.  Republicans are not keen to help with these issues, either.  But Americans need this stuff.   That’s why Trump needs REGULAR PEOPLE — Normies &amp; Pedes, alike — behind his policies.   If people support MAGA, we will have MAGA.  But if we leave it up to politicians, we will not reap the benefits of Trump’s efforts to be the President (GEOTUS) of Everyone.  Put down your red and blue flags and just board the train. "

"For us older pedes that were pissed at Obamacare we remember how they twisted this garbage into passing. For the first time in history our government mandated that we purchase a product under threat of the IRS. To get this to pass the Supreme Court they were forced to call it a ""tax"" to meet the legal requirements.  Well by doing that they allowed us to remove it with only 50 votes in a tax bill. Live by the tax code, get BTFO by the tax code."

"I remember back during the start of the republican presidential nomination when Donald Trump took the presidential nomination from Cruz. The Republican party was split between trump voters and never trumpers. The nevertrumpers threatened to either vote for hillary or dont vote at all. Even Glenn Beck hated Donald Trump so much that he would rather have hillary as president.  After Trump won the election, I havent heard anything from the never trumpers in recent months.  Does anyone know what happen to them?"

GEOTUS recognises Jerusalem as the capital with the support of Saudi Arabia- after all they are doing a fair bit of swamp plumbing of their own.

"If he's not on our team, he's only forcing democrats to focus on a battle they can't win.  Trump is untouchable, so they can waste their time on fruitless efforts and we win.   If he's on our team, great.   Either way, we win."

"**I think that the Republicans deliberately handled the recently passed Tax Bill they way they did as a giant middle finger to the Democrats.**  &amp;nbsp;  This is a quote by Byron York (Conservative columnist for the Washington Examiner) at 1 AM on the night of Obamacare passed in the Senate.  &gt;[Landmark health care legislation backed by President Barack Obama passed its sternest Senate test in the pre-dawn hours early Monday, overcoming Republican delaying tactics on a 60-40 vote that all but assures its passage by Christmas. “Let’s make history,” said Sen.

"http://tobealpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Beta-male-traits.png  The culture war that is being fought currently is largely between the differing mentalities of Alpha and Beta men/women. It is hard to change someone's cultural identity...even harder when one side values facts and results and the other side values emotions and virtue signaling.   The biggest shortfall of Beta mentality is that it presupposes that people are inherently good. They aren't. Left unchecked people descend into chaos very quickly. Maybe some of you have read Lord of the Flies. Or visited Detroit.   When you make this mistake, the next logical fallacy is usually not far behind...people's circumstances are not of their own making. So when someone falls on hard times it is ALWAYS because of outside circumstances and the individual is a victim. Returning them to prosperity is only a matter of giving them more opportunity.   Meanwhile the Alpha mindset knows inherently that people largely find themselves exactly where their poor choices led them. This works on the micro-level and the macro-level (again visit Detroit for reference). Alpha's are often devoted to helping the less fortunate...but define that term differently than Betas. Betas do NOT help the less fortunate, they want the government to fill that role. And over time, more and more Betas define themselves as ""less fortunate"" and thereby deserving of some level of government subsistence.   Betas think being less fortunate is having your feelings hurt, or feeling guilt or shame for making a poor choice. Betas think that the adversity we all face in life is a platform for victimhood and asking for sympathy and a handout. Betas think that giving a man a fish every day for the rest of his life is the best way to ensure he does not go hungry. Betas seek to mask life's adversities via social redistribution.   Alphas know that adversity is a fact of life. It is a universal constant. Well raised alphas even know that adversity is the furnace in which character is formed. Bible reading Alphas are even charged to welcome adversity and treat it as joy...knowing that God is putting them in a position to make a choice. The low road and blame hurt feelings on circumstance, or the high road in which they overcome through personal sacrifice and hardwork. Along the high road, alphas learn values like delayed gratification, maturity, empathy and compassion for others. They learn to value hardwork in others and learn to look for the fruit in others lives as a marker for how they've lived their lives.   Alphas face the same adversity as Betas. They get their feelings hurt. They just know that the world doesn't care about their feelings. And that they can either overcome it or be overcome by it. Overcoming adversity takes hardwork. Hardwork instill gratitude and thankfulness.   Be an alpha. And be an example to all who know you. They can make different choices too. Beta culture is tempting to the lost sheep. Life is hard. The Beta clan says to the lost sheep ""come here lost sheep, we know you are hurting, and we know who's fault it is...not yours, it's the alphas. So we are going to take from the alphas and give some of that to you and it will make you feel better"" but it doesn't.   Alphas see the lost sheep and say ""little sheep, are you hurting? Let us teach you how to avoid that pitfall next time. It's not easy, but if you learn it you'll never fall in that situation again. The more you learn, through hard work, the better you'll feel"" and they do.   Be the change...."

Here's a tribute to all of us centipedes who began supporting the Don from his announcement in 2015, who formed and built up this amazing community, and who never wavered or lost faith in him despite all the struggles and challenges he and we faced. We made history, in both the Primaries and the General. We defied all the odds because we finally had a candidate who put America, and the American people first.

"The Nanoagression is for things that are less bigoted than a micro agression.  Things that fall into this category are eating foods that have a color which resembles the skin of a marginalized group and using a pen that is a color of the skin of a marginalized group to write on your body.  (This is also known as ""Blackscriptface."")  Using words that can remind a marginized group of injustice are also in this category.  For instance, if you were to say ""My dog is bigger than a cat"" you will have potentially made a marginalized person think of a word that rhymes with ""bigger.""  You also used the word ""cat"" which has a slang word that is VERY misogynistic.  Additionally, alluding to the size of something might make a full sized, body positive person uncomfortable.   The Quantumagression is bigotry that is the same size as a nanoagression, but you haven't actually done it yet.  An example is a white bigot who is thinking about eating a potato.  Eating a potato is a nanoagression, because it has either red or brown skin, and thinking about it means you are mentally preparing yourself to act in a bigoted way in the future.   If you are reading this and are white, you have already committed multiple nano and several hundred quantum ones.  You should be ashamed."

"I got tired of winning. I just can't handle it anymore. For a year and a half or more now I've been glued to talk shows, T_D, and now Twitter. Jesus Christ don't get on Twitter. That place is worse than cancer. So much nonsense, lies, and misunderstanding from stupid, ignorant, uninformed, or just downright mean ass people. I've been on there for 5 days now (was following the Vols coaching search) and I just can't do it anymore. I need a break. My brain hurts. I want to fight all the battles but it's just not possible. No matter what truth you tell to these people they just can't get it through and will fight and argue with their same dead talking points. I'm going to continue winning, but for the sake of my sanity and well being I'm going to tune it all out for now. Got a big move coming soon anyway. Be good and keep up the fight. If the call beckons then I'll be back on the front lines. "

"So I've noticed recently this something a lot of MAGApedes disagree on.  A lot of people are willing to let 800,000 stay (it would only be that if we cut chain migration) in return for all of the above.  A lot of people aren't.  A lot aren't willing to concede anything.    Personally, I'm willing to trade DACA if we get literally all those things listed above.  I'm open to arguments against that.  I'm very curios as to how many of us are for or against it so comment your opinions down below"

"The socialist masterpiece that is Venezuela just keeps demonstrating collectivism’s obvious primacy over decadent Western freedom.  Monica Showalter reports:  In a purge as dramatic as that of Saudi Arabia or the Hollywood-media industrial complex, Venezuela has booted the most powerful names in its oil industry, with 65 officials arrested for corruption. Unlike the other purges, this one isn't about change or lawbreaking – just gang warfare to consolidate President Nicolas Maduro's socialist grip on power.  Powerful names in Venezuela's oil industry, people who've been in and out of the picture for years, went down like bowling pins in Venezuela this week. Nelson Martínez, Venezuela's chief of the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., was one. Eulogio del Pino, the country's oil minister, was another. Whoever was acting director of Venezuela's U.S. refiner and distributor, CITGO, isn't there, either.  A press release from Nov. 29 says Asdrubal Chavez is now running the U.S. operation, and many of the CITGO officials are now detained in Caracas. Chavez is a cousin of Venezuela's late president, Hugo Chavez …  But Maduro's men, the people doing the busting, are, if anything, more corrupt than the miscreants under arrest. Maduro's guys are the ones under U.S. sanctions for activities such as drug-dealing.  Thank you, Hugo Chavez and your ideological heirs, for leading the way. And thanks as well for all the zoo animals keeping starving peasants alive:      Thanks Hugo Chavez for showing that the poor matter and wealth can be shared. He made massive contributions to Venezuela &amp; a very wide world     — Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) March 5, 2013  "

"All security clearance holders are required to report any substantial contact with a foreigner, especially if that person is known to be a member of a foreign intelligence service. Failure to do this is grounds to have your security clearance immediately suspended and likely if the omission was intentional pulled.   So did Ohr report it and the security officer brush it aside or did he not report it.   If he did report it there will be an official record somewhere. I forget the exact reporting chain for this but I know NISPOM requires written reports of any contact with a member of a foreign intelligence service.    If he didn't report it why in the HELL is he still working in a position at DOJ that I'm sure requires atleast a secret clearance.  spez: Added comments about reporting chain, I'm not sure if this report ends up in JPASS or some other database but I know it should exist in written form somewhere.

"This is the Dems snagging the moral high ground while the Republicans are endorsing Moore and while there are still allegations against Trump. If they were honest they would stand by the law and stick to due process (innocent until proven guilty). What the Dems are doing here is making a standard where allegations are all that are necessary to take a person down. Basically they are idiots...but they are trying to change the way the public thinks about these things. I don’t believe the allegations against Moore (there’s really only one that’s technically a crime) because of the timing and the fact that there’s no proof. No witnesses, nothing. The media doesn’t see it that way. They are freely calling him a child molester. So they have this set up. The media makes the case that Moore is likely guilty, or IS guilty, and the Republicans are supporting him while the Dems kicked Franken and he’s barely guilty of anything more than some misunderstandings.

"I have a lib friend who doesn't believe fake news in MSM is a problem. He made the case that some errors are inevitable, given the sheer volume and speed at which MSM churns out stories. He admitted selection bias exists, in terms of what stories editors choose to pursue and publish, but refused to acknowledge how MSM actively pushes fake narratives to control public opinion and subvert both the will of the people and American values in general.   It's easy enough to pull up T_D and find the fake news du jour, but given the massive deluge of MSM fake news published in the past 2 years, I feel like a well organized database of annotated/juxtaposed MSM fake news stories, paired with some stats like fake news posted per week, number of stories retracted, etc. That would be a red pill MOAB.   Have any of you patriots come across anything like this? If not, can we please make it happen? I envision something along the lines of Judicial Watch, but directed at MSM.    "

From a hierarchical perspective, the &gt; rights of Allah (haqq Allah) take primacy of position.2""Pg140  * [JRE Joe Rogan and Gavin McInnes Discuss the Islam-Inbreeding Connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_nHf2XKwp4)  * [Bill warner on Islam and inbreeding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgwAGugPZtU)   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding_depression  * [Genetic disorders in the Arab world](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618440/)  * [CTGA: the database for genetic disorders in Arab populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1347378/)  *[ Estimating the Inbreeding Depression on Cognitive Behavior: A Population Based Study of Child Cohort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196914/)  * [Autosomal recessive diseases among Palestinian Arabs.] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1051064/)  * [Autosomal recessive disorders among Arabs: an overview from Kuwait.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1049748/)  * https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=93d_1384239379&amp;comments=1"

"Until he was a proved a winner they were not prepared to stand by their President. Now the wind blows favourably for him and by reflection the Republican party, they all want to slide back into his good books.   These snakes have fought him every step of the way and would have cheered at any point for him being bought down. Now they want to ride on his coattails.   No, don't give them a pass, they made their beds."

"This is happening more and more. The media reports an ""Asian"" man arrested for terrorist plot. ""Asian"" gang-members arrested for planning attack on US citizens.  No, I'm sorry. They might be from the continent Asia, but they are no more ""Asian"" than Muammar Gaddafi was African-American.  I'm Asian. My mother is Japanese. Everyone I know thinks ""chinky eyes"" when they hear Asian, so when they hear about ""Asian gangs"" (i.e. Muslim Terrorists) being arrested for plotting terrorist attacks, WE COME TO MIND. This is not acceptable, and frankly, it's racist. It's the MSM ganging up on peaceful and quiet ""minority"" groups who they know won't fight back.  But THIS IS NOT OK. I'm a Patriotic American pede. I shouldn't have to put up with Arab terrorists being called ""Asian,"" just to appease the PC police.  Yes, they are from the continent Asia. But Asia is massive. MASSIVE. The terms ""Middle Eastern"" or ""Arab"" are perfectly acceptable ways to refer to people in western Asia -- people who live thousands and thousands of miles away from the origin of real ""Asian Americans."""

""Here's the bizarre part of this: They didn't support the subpoena. They said there was no reason to see this documentation -- so I don't know why they would run down there and be the first people to review the information,"" Nunes wondered.  The Democrats know exactly where the dossier came from and the real reason for it's existence: To allow the Obama administration to gain FISA authorization to wiretap an opposing campaign. They knew there was a risk of getting caught so they invented Muh Russia and made an unprecedented number of unmasking requests in hopes that *something* would be found.  The news about Bruce Ohr shows that the Obama DOJ is probably involved as well.  This is unraveling very quickly. "

"Quick story:  Dad’s been a lifelong conservative, grew up in the depression and WW2.  But, last November he couldn’t pull the trigger and vote Trump, based on all the negative MSM coverage.  (Obviously, he didn’t vote Hillbot either)  Today, we’re talking about Colorado politics and out of the blue he says, “I am really impressed with Trump.”  Almost floored me!  He went on saying, “Trump is taking everything head on, and he’s getting the crooks in Washington and the media to step down.”  This from an 84 year old man, in struggling health, who gets his news still from the msm.  Despite the continuing msm anti-Trump agenda, he’s seen right through it.  It’s a great day, and I’m a proud son!"

"I tried to asked this question in another, more appropriate subreddit, but was not taken seriously and was labeled a ""troll"".  Recently I was accused of cultural appropriation. Not being familiar with that term, I looked it up and found that it means ""to take intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission. This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc.""  Since I am an honest person and believe in the rule of law, I do not wish to be violate anyone's property rights. However, when I tried to look up how one would go about properly acquiring a license to use some other culture's intellectual property, I came up empty.  How would I go about properly acquiring a license to some collective intellectual property? If say, I wanted someone to sell me a license so that I could wear my hear in dreadlocks, where would I go? Who can I talk to? And how much should I expect to pay?"
"With the year coming to an end I have a moment of reflection on everything that has happened, I must say it is nice - while not everything we all hoped, I hope we all knew coming into this it would take more time to clear up the disaster of the last what, 4 presidencies?   I will admit this is mainly a self brag post while I am very much buzzed off wine, but I want to at least come out and say it.  I sit here tonight, in this wine bar enjoying some high shelf wine and damn good cheese and crackers after I received my newest pay check. At the end of November I had my annual review from work come due and the boss called me in to have the talk, he gave me praise for my hard work and gave me a significant pay raise that has bumped me into the lower-middle class. The praise was mostly the hard work and time I have put in.  I work in the industrial field, go out to customers who own warehouses to work on their equipment and keep them up and running. What I have noticed is in this year alone the amount of customers increasing and expanding their companies profiles is amazing, we have been hiring new people left and right to keep up with the increase. This could come down to many things, but I cannot think of anything less than it being attributed to the Trump Admin, I have sort of tongue in cheek asked the bigger accounts how come their expansions are occurring at such a rate when over the last 4 years they have been relatively stagnant, the responses seem to dance around the regulation cuts, and now the tax cuts. No one wants to admit that maybe Trump has something to do with it, don't want to be called nazis, but when I dig deep enough to actually tell them the slashing his Admin is doing to the red tape they just smile and nod and say, ""Oh wow I did not know that"".  I will admit during the elections I listened too much to the bull that was fed, I never really trusted CNN, but I listened enough to let them make me doubt he would be better than any of the others. I sit here tonight reading T_D, drinking some wine, eating some damn good cheese, smiling knowing that while yes, the process will be slow and agonizing, with enough sweat and tears Trump is helping industry enough to where even me, some ""uneducated"" grease monkey hick, can proudly sit at a high-class wine bar and give a smile to the cutie across the bar as I order the next thing on the menu.  Christmas comes soon, I look forward to being able to buy real gifts for my family, Merry Christmas indeed."

"I am posting this again to get the message out.   **""Keep your plans dark and impenetrable as night, when you strike, fall like a thunderbolt"" - Sun Tzu**  In the spirit of Sun Tzu, let us became Hillary and Obama, think about what would you do if on their side.. they have not one plan but a series. The last in that series is an emergency plan, a fail-safe for them.. Turn Mueller up to 100, FORCE TRUMP TO FIRE HIM.  This is baseball folks, lawyer sports.. These fucks have spent tens of MILLIONS in man hours over the last year planning their case of all angles, including the ***fail-safe***. Trump fires Mueller, their $$$ plans come to life.  We will let them READ FROM A SCRIPT..   **It is like letting Rocket Man bomb Seoul..**  *No, you don't attack him head on and let his strength stay. You attack his strength from his weakness.*  Plan A for Obama/Hillary is Mueller will bring obstruction of justice charges that the House with an ""un-popular President in liberal circles"" can take and turn into 6 months of intense CNN live coverage of the ""Impeachment Hearings"" (even though they are only in the house, and are only the 1st step in a long list) This will NOT BE AL GREEN SHIT BOYS..  Obstruction of Justice charges kick off a machine in the gov.. a convener-belt of things happen that are drawn out and can be used against us from the dem's position of strength. THEY TAKE THE BOARD BACK!!  **Firing Him will only STRENGTHEN THEIR CASE THEY HAVE BEEN BUILDING ALL YEAR**  It is not designed to impeach Trump at that point, just a start, the Senate has the actual trial. The House stuff is more absolute riveting theater to DRIVE HIS POLLS DOWN AND NEUTER HIM ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE (by dividing congress over support even further)   **In the world of March 2017, this could work, but 2018 is going to be a storm by the end of Jan with the Inspector General's Report of corruption in DOJ and FBI.**  This alone will warrant a new Special Counsel that will then begin to **EAT MUELLER. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION.**   IF WE FIRE HIM, then we hand the board back to them.. that reality is much different..  Every snowflake soyboy pussyhat will be creaming in the streets, turn into Fred Astaire and sing in the rain.. etc. CNN and the rest of MSM can go 100% FULL TIME IMPEACHMENT TALK AND COVERAGE.  YOU BRING REALITY BY WILL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WE DID THIS TO ELECT TRUMP...  &gt; IMPEACHMENT THEATER IS MEME MAGIC FOLKS   It will seriously suck big time. I lived through Clinton years, I know what CNN can turn this into. The greatest show on earth for them. Every day every min, they will grouse and grovel over every fucking detail and line item. Trust me there will be tons to talk about.       ***BUT, attack from the flank, a weak and neutered Obama/Hillary ""obstruction of justice"" charge WITHOUT firing Mueller and WITH a new special counsel spun up by the Inspector General, now you have a pack of LARGER Lions hunting down Mueller and his wolves.***   ------------------- TL/DR  A) Fire M you play into the TRAP of Million $$ Hillary/Obama carefully laid plans (like letting Rocket Man bomb Seoul). they will be reading from their million $$ script, shit even Hillary started to leak some of this they have prepared.. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-dictator-us-president-justice-department-jeff-session-investigation-a8058821.html   B) **Use IG Report to hire SC and they go chimp-out without a fuck what to do. He will eat everything.**  Spez: Plan B has risk, ANY SC has ultimate power and can hire anyone, and can become corrupt and bias and can also run amuck and possibly find some past history in our side that can hurt us too. Many will argue end SC forever.   C) Bring so much evidence to light on the committee floors, hold FBI and Mueller in contempt, force him to step down under his own weight. This is much harder, because as you push back, they will ramp up Mueller and start leaking shit. This becomes more of a press each-other until one cracks, this can be loooong and drawn out in the MSM   -------------  The storm is real, from Rush to Grassley, they knwo all the details, wait for Jan and Inspector General's Report on FBI/DOJ Corruption and the Lions are unleashed.

This isn't a lie either, I will.  I try that technique again last night and he gets mad, and says 2018. I tell him let's bet $100 that he won't get inpeached in any year. He cries out 2016 watch, I inform him of the current year and he Reeeeees. Then I suggest 2024.   That's when he sucker punches me. Basically unphased I ask him if he actually hit me. He says yes, I push him 5 feet back. He throws his drink at me then charges at me. I slam his ass to the ground. He charges trying to get me on the ground and I drop him again.  I'm on top of him ready to knock him out, and I didn't even throw a punch. I got up, and that was it.

Sledges, snowmen, snowballs and the excitement of waking to find that the stuff has settled outside are all a rapidly diminishing part of Britain's culture, as warmer winters – which scientists are attributing to global climate change – produce not only fewer white Christmases, but fewer white Januaries and Februaries …   NOW:  Airports, railways and roads have shut down in the United Kingdom, as the country deals with a heavy dumping of snow.  About 30 centimetres of snow fell in some parts, with Wales and the Midlands bearing the brunt."

"A Libertarian Christian Heterosexual fortune 500 multi trillion dollar CEO and pro-life activist was teaching a class on Capitalism.

At this moment a brave green peace/peta abortion warrior who understood the necessity of a living wage and who served over 1 billion soup kitchens in capitalist induced leprosy camps stood up with a poor/uneducated/oppressed minority homosexual in his hand and asked the professor why this person is poor.

"Donald Trump said absolutely right. When Americans are free to thrive, innovate, &amp; prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, &amp; no goal beyond our reach.

"Fellow MAGA's:  Has anyone noticed how the prestige levels of being a part of the armed forces, FBI, CIA, NASA, and NSA has dropped off to a low level?  Ever since the early Bush Jr times with all the information coming out since then, being a part of the above organizations isnt as prestigious anymore due to how these organizations are being politicized.  We have wars we shouldnt be a part of, scandals and corruption in the upper echelons of the FBI, the CIA not actually being for the US populace but to be a root for the deep state, and the NSA spying on its own ppl and not foreign powers that threaten it.  It seems abundantly clear now that an ever growing majority of ppl who enter these organizations arent there because theyre passionate, they just see it as a means to get a guaranteed paycheck from an ever growing system that is becoming more and more burdened by the day.  You have too many ""Ill just put in my 4 years then im out"" military personelle.  You have woman military personnel purposely getting pregnant so they dont have to go to hostile areas.  Theres an ever growing population that are Diversity recruits even though qualifications of other folks dominate these recruits.  Filling of positions of ppl with previously known to them but not to these organizations with mental health issues.   Reintegration procedures for those coming off the frontlines or leaving the FBI, etc.. becoming more and more cumbersome w/no regard to safety and security of those parties that theyre being reintegrated into.    ""Veteran"" status is laughed at.  The list can go on and on with trends that have been observed and it sickens me to no end.  Serving in any capacity of the US Govt now makes you a pawn of the global elites.  And the undermining of American values and ethics is appalling.       "

"Recently we have been seeing a lot of 'survivors' coming forward accusing high profile people of 'sexual misconduct'. Why do the American people jump to the 'survivors' defense when we have the rule of innocent unless proven guilty.  We are abandoning a basic principle that is necessary for a civilized and democratic society. We need to launch investigations into these allegations and not just jump to the accuser's defense. The accusers have everything to gain if they are a) telling the truth and b) lying, because if they lie the people will believe them and they ruin the reputation of the accused. There also needs to be harsh punishment for spreading false allegations of sexual misconduct as it can and will ruin a person's life and career.  Also, why are we taking allegations from 30+ years ago seriously? They have no proof and they expect us to take them seriously. Literally, anyone could come out and say that they were sexually assaulted unless of course, you say you were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton. "

What a bunch of idiots! Aren't they losing readership? Don't they need the clicks? Thanks! Didn't really care that much, anyway!!!

He has blocked the Trump agenda every way he credibly can. Remember the tape where he said he wouldn't back the president? He getting ready to run in 2020 depending on how the mid terms go. That was always his plan. He will continue to stall and sabotage and see if the winds favor him after the midterms. At this point I think Ryan and McConnel are in cahoots to actually loose as much as possible in 2018 without giving up majorities so they can blame the president and call it a repudiation of Trump.McConnel spent at least 60 million to lose AL to a democrat just so Bannon couldn't claim a win.

"Maybe I haven't gone down this particular rabbit hole yet, but the Globalism endgame doesn't make sense.

To me this doesn't make sense for even if they completed the task of taking over the West, they'd still have the rest of the world to compete with.  If THEY are the ""Commies"", surely THEY have realized with the collapse or failure of every Communist regime that it's not the answer.  Now obviously a united planet a la ""Star Trek"" would be powerful force and the corporations that impede innovative progress were removed, but it WOULD require a global socialism, MASS possibly forced education, forced population control, aka not possible at this time.

"CNN MONEY Tried to downplay Trump's Presidency Success for the Stock Market, saying the S&amp;P hit 127 record highs during Obama's time in office....and Trump's only had 52 record-breaking highs.  CNN thinks we suck at math. Let's break it down: Obama served 96 months in Office, meaning the S&amp;P had a 'record high' every 22.5 days on average. Trump has served 11 months...His S&amp;P 'record high' is occurring every 6.3 days.  This means that Trump is DESTROYING Obama's records by more than 350%.   Do the numbers yourself (link: http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/11/investing/trump-obama-bull-market-stocks/index.html).

"With this new Tax Cut Plan passed by the House, that means everyone will get more money for themselves than give to the government for any reason.  Because everyone has less taxes to pay, that means businesses have more money, to hire more people, people can buy more stuff, and companies will have more money, and the cycle continues.  What step am I missing that says anything is bad?   Liberals also say that ""the 1% gets more money and we the working people pay more taxes"" to that I ask: 1) How is someone granted the title as 1 in the first place? 2) But if there's less money for people to keep and less money being spent, how will that be beneficial to anyone? 3) If we do tax the companies more than the middle class, how will they stay and keep the company alive if they have to throw out some employees to keep profits? IKEA left Sweden because of that.    Seriously, am I missing a step? Please help this young pede out "

"Let me preface this post by stating that the support this subreddit shows for the Iranian people is heartwarming, and dispels many negative stereotypes associated with the user base. Nowhere else on this site have I seen such a mass outpour of cheering for the Iranian people. That being said, I think we need to start talking about the reality of the situation there, the events that we should expect to occur, and the next steps that we can take in our everyday lives to support the Iranian people against this terrible adversary that we share.  I hope that none of the predictions I outline here turn out to be the case.  To start, the protests against the Iranian regime are likely going to fail for the same tactical reasons that the protests in 2009 failed:  - The population of Iran is by and large unarmed, so an armed rebellion is entirely out of the question. - The Iranian military is very much attached to the theocratic government of the country. In fact, the overarching branch of the military, the Revolutionary Guards (Sepah-e-Pasdaran, or ""Sepah"" for short) is directly connected to the politics of the country, both on state and provincial levels. They also own approximately 60% of the nation's industry. All of this being said, the connection between the military, the economy, and the state nullifies the chances that military forces will stage a coup in alliance with the protests. - Hezbollah is directly connected to the Iranian government, and the government has used them as a force to quell protests in the past. In 2009, armed Hezbollah units were deployed to major cities as a countermeasure to widespread protests. - Plainclothes militant units are used as a stealth tactic to enter crowds of protesters and violently break them up from within.  Politically, the situation looks similarly grim:  - Iran's leadership are powerful and often wealthy men who have no reason to forfeit control of the country, especially when the protests suffer from the aforementioned tactical disadvantages. - Despite the illusion of ""democracy"" through parliament and presidential elections, Iran's politics are controlled entirely by a subset of theocratic clergy alongside the Revolutionary Guard (Sepah). The population, therefore, has never had real democratic power in the country, and despite the acts of valiance we see in these protests, they still don't.  We are already starting to see the blow back:  - The political establishment has begun to create the illusion of progress. For instance, they announced an end to the arrest of women who refuse to wear the hijab. This looks like a success on part of the protesters, but the change in policy also states that women will be forced to attend mandatory Islamic education classes for failing to wear the hijab. And what, my lovely fellow Redditors, do you think will happen if the women do not attend those classes? Remember that the Iranian government can say anything it likes, and regardless of how much the media prances over the promise of progress, the reality that Iranians live on the ground, in Iran, is likely much different. - Iranians are already being attacked by security forces. Due to the fact that the Iranian government exerts influence on all media organizations within the country, it's difficult to understand how many people have been attacked, arrested, or killed, but this is likely just the beginning of it. You can find multiple videos of these attacks through social media, and I urge you to post them everywhere you can. We'll talk more about that in the ""Next Steps"" part of this post. - Lets talk about Iranian state media. Regime-driven propaganda runs very deep. If you tune into any of Iran's state-controlled media channels (http://www1.live.irib.ir/) you'll notice that there is no mention of the protests. At all. In fact, most of the programs I've tuned into on the three main channels, as well IRINN (Iran's official state news organization) are running programs talking about the country's growing industry and jobs. Seem like an uncanny coincidence?  With these points outlined, it's unlikely that Iran's state-military complex will resign from their positions and make way for the establishment of a secular democracy. If anything, the repercussions of these protests will become more dire in the coming days and weeks. That being said, there is something big that you all can do as a community to support the Iranian people. It doesn't involve you money, nor does it require an excess amount of your time. Here is my suggestion to you freedom-loving peoples:  Counter Iranian state propaganda by posting and reposting videos of the Iranian regime's crimes. Many of the videos shared thus far are of unveiled women. How about revealing the terrors of the Iranian government? These are examples of such videos, posted to Youtube a few hours ago:   - Five Casualties after Iranian State Forces Shoot Into Crowd in Lorestan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlUJULvS7gg - Tear Gas Shot Into Tehran College: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx9yghBA8GY - Iranian State Forces Shooting Into Crowd in Lorestan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIr4eiUls4s - Bullets and Tear Gas Being Shot At Peaceful Protesters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVW5RuOn-5g - Iranian Police Charge &amp; Fire On Protesters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu2eGJoLC3M - Unarmed Iranian Civilians Fight Armed Security: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHhzmGKfdqE - Iranian Civilians Charge Armed Security Forces: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRlJeiETaU0  It's important that the government of Iran be painted for the monster that it is. I intend on expanding this list with more videos of this nature, right here, so that they can be spread across the Internet.  As I'm writing this, there are 546,579 of you subscribed to this subreddit, and over 11,000 of you are online. That's enough of you to make a serious difference. If we can show the world exactly what is going on in the streets of Iran right now, we can override the media narratives being pushed by the Iranian government, and we can expose this for what it is: Hundreds of thousands of people who can no longer be the prisoners of an oppressive, anti-Western government, and who have risen up in every major city in the country - at risk of their lives - to demonstrate against the Islamic Republic."

"YT, FB, Reddit, etc. Sometimes I get curious and venture out of my bubble of content tailored to my interests. Looking at trending on almost every social media outlet only lasts a few minutes. It is so propagated and bias, it's not even funny. It's no wonder libs are so easily sheep. When 6/10 trending videos are some anti Trump bs like the Russia crap or how unfit DT is. It's absolutely obnoxious. I hate pop culture to begin with, but with the current trends for everything being politically bias, I think I'll stick to keeping stray from the herd. God forbid I'm not trendy enough for my generation. I always fit in better with the 90s kids anyway."
"So, are they taking a holiday break? Why haven’t we heard anything from them recently?"
"[Luke 1:5-25 KJV]  There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.   And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.   But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.   And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.   And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.   And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.   And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."
"This is good, because it will slowly redpill normies in the middle, as they gradually realize how detached people like Chris Cuomo (for example) are from reality.  As Democrats calmly ignore anything that compromises Mueller, we calmly repeat it.  Firing Mueller now would be a huge political gift to Democrats, because it would give them the opportunity to 1) make claims of obstruction of justice, and 2) start clean with another S.C. to shower praise on.  The importance of not letting them start clean cannot be over-stated.  As long as Mueller's investigation has a flat tire, let Democrats ride it until the rims are sparking on the pavement.  Changing S.C. just gives them a new car with a new set of tires.  It will breathe new life into the lifeless ""investigation.""  (In fact, that may be why Democrats are floating rumors of Trump considering firing Mueller.  They're trying to bait Trump into actually doing it.  They want him to.)    Our job is simple.  Never stop repeating anything we know about flaws in the investigation, so it becomes obvious to normies that we're arguing with West World robots.  The West World robots are unflappable in their determination to ignore anything that supports our argument.  That's why we can't get exasperated by their obstinance.  They're not our audience.  Heck, they're not even human.  Normies are our audience.  Mueller's investigation is therapy for Democrats.  It's kind of like giving codeine to a heroin addict.  (Fake news is codeine for them as well.)  If you take the codeine away, there's no telling what they'll do.  Of course, codeine is habit forming as well, but it's better than heroin.  Thus, I think we should let the baby have their bottle, because it's better than listening to them cry and throw temper tantrums.  Thank God for Donald Trump.  He's the leader I've been waiting my whole life for since Ronald Reagan.  "

"The NHS and Obamacare not working properly? Blamed on us.  Extremely high crime rates in mostly-black liberal-controlled ""Urban"" areas? Blamed on us.  The evil acts of Antifa, BLM, ISIS, and other terrorist groups? Blamed on us.  Gun crime and crime in general? Blamed on us.  Imaginary racism and sexism they percieve? Blamed on us.  Actual racism and sexism and rape and crime from extreme radicalized uncultured immigrants they import en masse into the cities of the poor people they loathe so they can feel humanitarian and pretend to be human? Blamed on us.  Evety corrupt act from every rich or successful(Or both) person, ever? Blamed on us.  Their own fears of a world ending in atomic annihilation, their own fears of a world burned away by its own sun, their own fears of men in jackboots putting transgender people in death camps? Blamed on us.  The cognitive dissonance tearing away at their psyches as the last shreds of humanity within these brainwashed zombies struggle and die for good, confused and afraid? Blamed on us.  The incredibly high post-op transgender suicide rate? Blamed on us, because to think otherwise would mean admitting John Money's little experiment with those two suicidal boys really was a failure, and upon the hands of liberalism, you'll see the blood of every post-op transgender person's death since the day he and liberalism invented the concept and forced it into the world. Liberalism doesn't have what it takes to take a good, long, hard look at itself in the mirror and realize what it's become and what it's done, so it creates layer upon layer of lies and delusions so its members can keep on thinking they're the heroes, or at the very least, enlightened neutral bystanders not responsible for their ideology's sins.  The average Liberal believes he is one of the good townspeople in their own little stories, and they're waiting for a hero to save them from us ""Evil racist sexist nazi fascist bigot Hitlers"". He believes his failings and the failings of his ideologies are not his own, but ours. He believes if all the people politically opposed to socialist healthcare systems and socialism in general and their political views in general were wiped off the face of the earth, they could live happily in peace, free from the ""Borgoise swines"", free from the ""Alt-Right"", free from the ""Cishet scum"". They have been trained by their own delusions and owners to resent us for existing on a planet where they can't have all the nice things they feel entitled to have. They resent us, and our existences, our culture, our language, our history, and our future. Because they're evil, stupid, or both, and more than they're scared of imaginary jackbooted thugs or imaginary white rape gangs, they're scared of what will happen to their precious imaginary future when the rest of the world figures out what we've already known for decades.  The divide in America is only going to grow as more people wake up and realized how unhinged, deranged, and unhealthy for themselves and the world Liberalism has become. And this is good, because the divide is between Liberal zombies and the humans they want to lie to, manipulate, blame, shame, and control. But I think most of all, they're scared that when we truly go from the silent majority to the vocal majority and swear to never suffer like this again... They'll never get to blame their failures on us again. They'll have to take responsibility for the blood on their hands instead of flicking it at us, and this terrifies them.  They'll have to wake up and grow up, and as their cryboasting posts on tumblr announce to the world, ""They don't know how to adult""."

He was calling people out by name on their bullshit even back then.  He saw corrupt politicians with apartments that should have been going for 10k/month paying like 600/month under government 'rent control'.  Multiple times throughout the book he points out how government control over anything essentially ruins it and that politicians are generally inept. The book offers such great perspective.  You could also tell that he genuinely loves NYC so it's fucking sad to see how they are all cucks now.

"Donald Trump said right Remember, the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill."
I tell you I am enraged at these totally impartial facts being reported by very trustworthy anonymous source from a paper dedicated to impeaching Trump.
"I get really crazy enthusiastic with nature and wildlife. Please bear this in mind as you read :)  We know that Wednesday was a historical day for our country with GEOTUS getting the tax reform passed. The first real change in our tax code in decades, another promise to the American people, kept.   I couldn't be online or with my brethren at The_Donald to interact and watch all the coverage because I needed to make a 150 mile journey to Lynchburg, VA from my home in Northern Virginia.  The route I was taking was US 29S. It is a very south westerly road so in the morning with the sun rising in the east, the sun stays at my back the whole way down to Lynchburg. What a gorgeous day! On the way down, traffic was only bad as I passed through that pit of liberalism, Charlottesville. So many Bernie stickers on cars...ugh. The rest of the trip for me was wide open and 80mph. Ahhhh let the reins out a notch and let her run!                         (yeah, I know, it's not that fast but I get speeding tickets so I gotta be chill)   So I meet my family for lunch and to catch up. My phone needs a new battery so I left it in my car to charge while we were eating. So...no news, no way of checking out my politics. No updates. We had a great lunch, swapped Christmas presents and I made my way northeast back home.    Because it was now much later in the day, the setting sun was now at my back. It was casting a gorgeous golden glow over everything in front of me. The ribbon of pavement that lie ahead, the evergreens taking on color. It was bathed in beautiful light. I was admiring the views as I passed through Madison, VA. I had to stop at a red light. I figured I'd turn on the radio to try to catch up on news, hit 'scan' to find a radio station and caught a report on the triumph of Trump's tax reform.    I was sitting in the left lane at the red light, waiting. I noticed a deer carcass to my left,  at the intersection. As I waited, I saw a few turkey buzzards swoop down and try to feed off of the deer. All of a sudden the vultures all scattered at once, just as the light turned green and I started to accelerate. As I pulled my car forward, a giant wingspan and blinding white head came into view, his wing almost hitting the hood of my car, and I screamed out loud, alone, 'OH MY GOD ITS A FUCKING BALD EAGLE!!!'   Now, I've only ever seen a wild eagle one other time before, back in 2009. I was so stoked back then!!    I tried to see where this one was going, but I was still driving forward, scanning the sky as much as I could without running off the road.    As the radio began to play GEOTUS making the announcement with Scott, Ryan and McConnell,  I begin to hear my president's voice, and I could not believe my eyes! The eagle swooped around and got about 2 feet from my driver's side window and for almost a mile IT PACED MY CAR! It flew right beside me.  I was driving alongside a wide open median of grass with no trees or shrubs. The light from the sunset was so warm and golden and lit all of the details on the landscape. I was sooooo close!! It was flying on my left,  so close that if I had rolled down the widow it seemed as if I could touch him. Oh my god he was so beautiful!!! The blinding white of his head, and the bright opaque yellow of his massive beak. I could see there was a bit of meat there, flapping as he flew. I could see his eye, so dark and sharp and the detail of the tiny white feathers at his neck whipping against the brown of his body. He was incredible!    I would have given ANYTHING for someone behind me to have gotten a picture of the back of my shiny red car, with the TRUMP name emblazoned in sparkles being hit by that golden sunset, with an American Bald Eagle flying next to me, as my president's voice poured out through my speakers. I can picture it in my mind and that will have to do. But I must tell you that these precious few moments brought tears to my eyes and I swear that had to be one of the coolest, most patriotic incidents I have ever had in my entire life.  I just wanted to share that with you all!         MAGA MAGA MAGA  https://imgur.com/n3h1bvD My Car  https://imgur.com/a/ic5ML  My first bald eagle sighting 2009 "

"This is the simplest explanation for what the hell happened in a deep red state.   It was invaded, pure and simple   What is the definition of an invasion? Foreign funded actors come in and take control over the fate of the locals .    A democrat, won in a deep red state with the help of out of state funding and a well funded national media hit campaign, run by blue state liberal journalists.   Now we have abundant proof of voter fraud.    There are at least 11 million -20 million illegal immigrants in this country.   Liberals can call them undocumented immigrants, but they are not even illegal immigrants. They are an invasion force.  In the absence of strict voter ID laws, this invasion force can be shifted infinitely towards any election.   They will not make the same mistake they did in 2016.   How to deal with this invasion?   Remove ALL the invaders   Deport ALL illegal immigrants.   Defend yourself   Enforce strict voter ID laws   Fight  the enemy.   Vote!!!. In the upcoming elections , no matter what, we have to Vote the democrats out.  Be vigilant during election time. Look for , record and share voter fraud evidence. Push for voter id reform and immigration reform   Punish the traitors   Alabama wouldn't have been lost ( for now) , if it wasn't for the GOP cucking out.

"Chris Tucker gave out his list of 100 racist things to show how absolutely stupid racism is in general.  Trees can be labeled racist.  Speaking in an accent is racist.  Milk can be racist because minorities suffer from lactose intolerance more.  Diabetes is also racist.  Science is racist cause it can't explain black magic.  So racism doesn't have to originate with a human being. It can be a sickness. It can be plants. Science is racist.  But whites are called ""racist"".  Yet minorities can't be racist according to some liberal media.  Is ""racist"" itself a racial slur specifically to attack white people?  Even the word ""racist"" is racist.  Language is very powerful.  I believe this is a classic propaganda buzzword.  Heck the word is only a 100 years old.  Really old people still use the term prejudiced over racism - at least the ones I know.  "
"I see all these young young young kids wanting to be trans. It reminds me of when I was in the 5th or 6th grade, wanting to be a goth and look like Marilyn Manson. Lucky for me, my Christian middle class parents had none of it.   It drove me nuts! I felt like I was being held back from ""who I really was"". At 10 or 11, I didn't know who I was is the truth though. I hated them for it, hated I could only wear one black item at a time. I felt like I was living under Nazi rule.   Flash forward to freshmen year, I see all the goth kids getting ostricized and not treated well. I felt horrible for them, but then remembered how close I was to being them of it weren't for my parents.   They explained it this way to me. ""Follow the music, learn the songs, if a concert comes near we'll take you, but your clothes has nothing to do with who you are. If the day you turn 18 and you're mentally developed enough and still feel like that's you, we'll personally but you a wardrobe.""  As an adult looking back, I just wanted attention. Good our bad. And I'm so glad I had parents who didn't just say okay.  But having a love for Manson never changed. There was a day years ago when his album with heart shaped glasses came out, I was in a HotTopik to get a backing for my gauges and they were doing a trivia for Manson swag. So me, dressed in suit and tie on my lunch break hears the question of the name of his autobiography. I look around at all of the baby angels of darkness looking to each other at a loss. I chime in with Long Hard Road Out Of Hell. They all look shocked that Mr. Lame tie polished shoes got it right.   So I guess what I'm saying is that all these little kids who are trying to be trans are really not feeling that, they're feeling like they want to be looked at, no matter good or bad. They need to enjoy the culture study it, know it, go to events, but don't start acting on the physical until your brain is matured. You'll probably find (as research shows a 90% regret rate) they just wanted attention and will be glad they never made the move, but have a ton of knowledge from it.   "

But I don’t care anymore, cause He took too damn long, and from Under my seat, I pull out the Mirror I’ve been saving; I’m laughing, Laughing loud, the blood rushing from his face To mine, as he grows small, A spot in my brain, something That may be squeezed out, like a Watermelon seed between Two fingers. Pop takes another shot, neat, Points out the same amber Stain on his shorts that I’ve got on mine, and Makes me smell his smell, coming From me; he switches channels, recites an old poem He wrote before his mother died, Stands, shouts, and asks For a hug, as I shrink, my Arms barely reaching around His thick, oily neck, and his broad back; ’cause I see my face, framed within Pop’s black-framed glasses And know he’s laughing too.

"I've argued before that Hold 'Em is a better analogy than 4-D chess for how Trump works. Like many great Hold 'Em players, especially ones with a deep stack, he bluffs, bullies, and frustrates other players to put them ""on tilt"" so they make mistakes.  But that's tactical. The big picture, the strategic picture, goes back to what he's always been known for: ""The Art Of The Deal"". And the art of the deal is largely about leverage. Notice where your opponent is weak; and where you relatively opponent is strong, build up leverage -- shamelessly! -- until your opponent is relatively weak there too.  The ""shameless"" part of that is why so many believe The Donald is a clown... because it's true. He's willing to be a clown. He'll complain about little points. He'll throw a tantrum, And then he'll change his tone on a dime. Anything (NOT EVIL) to shift the ground, to improve his position. In many ways, that's why he's perfect to fight these particular forces of evil. Because he's actually very, very strong; very sure of himself and his positions; very secure. He doesn't care what anyone says about him. He doesn't care what he looks like. Since ""naming and shaming"" -- labeling, and name calling -- are really the only ""public arguments"" that the other side has -- this is perfect. Those tactics just don't work on Trump. HE DOESN'T CARE what they call him. He'll sometimes act like he does, but it's all an act, just to push back, just to gain advantage. HE REALLY DOESN'T CARE!  Anyway, I bring all this up because of Jeff Sessions. Like many of you, I've been very impatient with Session and the whole administration for not draining ""The Swamp"" fast enough. What are they waiting for? Where are the arrests? Where are the trials? Where are the confessions with all their sordid details? It's not that I don't know (or feel that I know) the truth already; it's that I want to gloat about it, and convince everybody who's eyes are still closed!  But I started to realize that maybe Trump isn't quite as blood-thirsty as I am. Maybe he thinks he can ""Drain The Swamp"" without tearing the country apart. And maybe, just maybe, he feels that he has to build up some leverage first. Re-energize the economy. Have some legislative achievement. Who knows? Maybe he even thinks more of these GOPe assholes can be saved than I do.  So he worked, and he waited, and so did Jeff Sessions -- waited and worked behind the scenes until at least the tax cut bill was law. Because that does give Trump a lot of political clout all of the sudden. And, just like clockwork, we start seeing activity from Session's DOJ, along with Trump's most recent EO.  So: is this analysis right? Will 2018 be the year, finally, of serious Swamp Draining? I hope so. I even think so. I'm sure Trump and his new-found allies in the GOPe realize that it might be nice to go into the 2018 elections with the swamp critters running.  But maybe not. Maybe more leverage has to be built up. If so, that will drive me crazy; but I guess we'll just have to wait and see!"
I ain't even joking.
"I have written this Research paper about illegal immigration. Constructive criticism is welcome, but comments like ""This sucks, die fag."" will not be responded to. I hope you all enjoy it. It has been broken up into 8 parts. Please keep note while reading this that this is my first research paper.  Disease Population Crime Protection Against Deportation Economics Terrorism Humanitarian Legalization  Here is the Research paper. It is 2,640 words long. I sincerely apologize for the format of the paper. I had trouble putting quotes in the right way.  Please keep in mind that I am in high school, so I have no experience with writing an academic paper. So be easy for me, please.  With the election of President Trump this last January, many people have been wondering when his all-important wall will be started on. I for one cannot wait for it to be built. I believe too few people know how bad immigration, and specifically, illegal immigration is to the U.S. As well as it's citizens.  DISEASE  There is one thing I feel is understated in the immigration argument, and that is the bringing and the spreading of diseases to the U.S. population. The Vice President of the Border Patrol Union, Chris Cabrera told host Martha MacCallum on Fox News.  “Coming off the long journey they (The illegal Immigrants) have been subjected to and then diseases some agents are contracting. We had one get bacterial pneumonia a couple days ago,” Here is him talking on Fox News. “The border patrol is trying to play catch up and we’re having a lot of diseases coming in and some we haven’t seen in decades and we are worried they’ll spread throughout the United States especially if they are being released and have the disease.” He continued “U.S. Border Patrol agents are worried that what’s coming over into the U.S. could harm everyone. This time the focus is not on the women and children that are crossing over in droves. Agents are worrying about a viral outbreak. We are sending people everywhere. The average person doesn’t know what’s going on down here,” “Our Border Patrol agents check on us all the time and they told us about the outbreak of scabies, We are starting to see chicken pox, MRSA staph infections, we are starting to see different viruses,” “It’s contagious, (The diseases). We are transporting people to different parts of the state and different parts of the country,”  Border Patrol agents told the Blaze. “Poverty and the lack of advanced health care in Central America have heightened concerns among law enforcement and medical professionals about the kinds of sickness the surge of illegal immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border could be bringing with them.” A health official told the blaze ""We have no real way to stop at the border, and we have no idea health-wise what diseases are coming across.” He continued “There’s no real medical screening either. Basically if [an illegal immigrant] tells a Border Patrol agent or law enforcement official they feel sick, or if they look sick, then they’re checked. If they don’t say anything, that’s it, they’re cleared.” Then he said. “And if you were feeling sick if you were illegal, would you tell anyone? They’ve sent children and families all across the country without medical health screenings.” He concluded with “(The federal government) needs to realize there is a potential for a public health disaster,” Kenneth Wolfe, deputy public affairs director at the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families told the blaze. “They are given a well-child exam and given all needed childhood vaccinations to protect against communicable diseases and screened for tuberculosis, “ She added, “If children are determined to have any communicable disease or have been exposed to a communicable disease, they are placed in a program or facility that has the capacity to quarantine. If they have mental health problems, they are similarly placed in a specialized facility to meet their needs and not in a temporary shelter.” According to the border health care official, “If they continue to flow into the United States, the illegal immigrant population will quickly overwhelm our resources and leave officials with limited options,” A border patrol agent from the Rio Grande Sector said, “This is a failure of Health and Human Services and the federal government who knew this was coming and didn’t care to prepare for it or didn’t want to,” He added, “We are doing our job but the federal government is failing to do theirs.“ Border Patrol Agent Albert Spratte said, “The numbers keep growing,” he added, ""It's not slowing down. We're concerned about the health of our employees, their families, and Americans. Of course, we're concerned about the health of those who are crossing over, but our resources are stretched so thin we just can't keep up."" Chris Cabrera stated, “It's a tough situation for the Border Patrol agents and the illegals immigrants as well,” He then said,  This is all rather damning, yet there's more. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there have been 200-250 new cases of leprosy or Hansen's disease. Thes numbers are reported annually. In a 2006 report, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of reported cases of leprosy in the country ""peaked at 361 in 1985 and has declined since 1988.""  POPULATION  Something that is rather stupifying is that Pew Research Institute estimates in 2014, 11.2 million illegal immigrants were in the U.S. This is roughly 3-5% of the population. However, According to the 2016 Current Population Survey, immigrants and their U.S.-born children now number approximately 84.3 million people or 27 percent of the overall U.S. population. 52% are Hispanics. The six states that hold 59% of illegals are California, Texas, Arizona, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. 66% of illegals have lived in the U.S. for 10 years or more. over 100,000 illegal immigrants cross into the United States each year. In 2014, nearly 10,000 unaccompanied children from Mexico and Central America crossed the border every month. These numbers are staggering.  CRIME  Crime is the biggest reason people are pro-closed borders, and for good reason. Research by the Federal Government Oversight Organization Judicial Watch in 2014 estimates that 50% of violent crimes are done by the southern border. 40% or 24,746 were in court districts along the southern border. California, Arizona, and Texas. California's southern district has 4,900 cases filed. New Mexico has 4,000 cases and Arizona with over 3,500. The western district of Texas has the highest with over 6,300 criminal cases filed, followed by the southern district with just over 6,000 as of 2014. The department of justice documents 19% or over 12,000 cases were for violent crimes, and 22% for drug crimes, also in 2014.  The U.S. Commission found that 75% of all defendants convicted and sentenced for drug-related crimes were by illegals. Illegals are also responsible for 17% of drug trafficking sentences and 1/3 of all prison sentences in 2014. The U.S. Department of justice and the U.S. sentencing commission reported that, as of 2014, illegal immigrants convicted and sentenced to over 13% of all violent crimes in the U.S. According to the FBI, 62,642 murders were committed in the U.S. between 2005, and 2008, and 115,717 between 2003 and 2009. The General Accounting Office documents that criminal immigrants commit 23,064 of these murders. In other words, 3% of the population is committing 22% to 37% of all murders in the nation.  Illegals are 3 times more likely to commit murder. In California, over 2,400 of the 130,000 prison population are in prison for homicide. In California, 94 illegals per 100,000 prisoners, compared to the 74 citizens and legal non-citizen immigrants. And in Arizona, the rate is 69 illegal compared to 54 citizens. In New York, 169 for every 100,00 compared to 48 citizens. However, in Texas, the numbers are 55.4 for illegals and 65 for legal. In Florida, it's 55 illegal to 68 legal. Recent crime analysis from the Department of Homeland Security and Texas law enforcement authorities indicate that between June 2011 and March 2017, over 217,000 criminal immigrants have been arrested and booked into Texas jails. In researching the criminal careers of these illegals, it was revealed that they have jointly committed over 600,000 crimes. Included:  1,200 homicides,  69,000 assaults,  16,854 burglaries,  6,200 sexual assaults,  700 kidnappings,  69,000 drug offenses,  8,700 weapon violations,  3,800 robberies,  45,000 abstracting police charges,  The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that over 127,000 or 66% of these immigrant criminal defendants were in our country illegally at the time of their arrest. Immigration and Customs Enforcement admitted that they had to realize over 36,000 illegals from prison where they were awaiting deportation.  PROTECTION AGAINST DEPORTATION  Another thing that Most people pass over for the immigration argument is that many liberals and liberal politicians have been protecting illegals from deportation. In 2014, Governor Brown of California signed a bill that amended the state salute amending the maximum sentencing for misdemeanor crimes by 1 day from 365 days to 364 days. This bill was signed to avoid federal law providing deportation for illegal and legal immigrants that have gotten 365-day sentencing or more. With bill 109.and 47, (the bills that made this possible.). Brown is effectively preventing the federal law from deporting violent criminals. In 2014, according to testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Obama administration released “193 illegal immigrants with homicide convictions, 426 people with sexual-assault convictions and 16,000 with drunk-driving convictions.” Over the past three years, more than 100,000 illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes and who should have been deported have been released by the Obama administration back into the general population.  ECONOMICS  Some say that opening the borders and letting everyone in will be economically good. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, ""the best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks."" The result is illegal immigrants pay billions of tax dollars every year. As studies have found, if illegal immigrants had a legal status, they would earn more, resulting in paying more taxes. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy: Illegal immigrants paid, $11.6 billion dollars in state and local taxes in 2013. This includes $7 billion in sales taxes, $1.1 billion in income taxes and $3.6 billion in property taxes. Tax payments from the states ranged from $2.2 million in Montana to $4.1 million in California, which has over 3 million illegal immigrants. California, Texas, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, and Florida derived the most taxes from illegal immigrants. In 2013, the average effective state and local tax rate of undocumented immigrants, which was paid in taxes, was 8 percent, compared to 5.4 percent for the top 1 percent of all taxpayers. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the total tax contributions by illegal immigrants is a total of $18,968,857,700, with $15,447,897,700 in federal taxes paid, and $3,520,960,000 in state and local taxes.  This is all true. But, the cost of harboring the illegals in the U.S. is far beyond any benefits. According to research done by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, taxpayers are paying an annual bill of 19 million dollars a day going to house and care for a 300,000-450,000 convicted criminal immigrants who can be deported, and who are currently living in jails and prisons. These figures include illegal and legal immigrants who have committed and have been convinced of crimes. Accounting estimates that the total cost for all the expenses of correctional, medical and support survives for adults and minors is over 1.8 billion dollars. Other estimates the total cost for medical only is up to 17 billion. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Federal Justice Expenditures are up to 13 billion dollars. Federal welfare is costing Americans an annual bill of 5.8 billion dollars. The total cost for Federal Expenditures is over 45.8 billion dollars.  American taxpayers also pay up to 40 billion dollars a year for education for illegals and/or their children. Illegals have a poverty rate of 26% twice of a legal immigrant. 58% of Illegals are on welfare; Also take advantage of public services on the taxpayer's dime. So that is anywhere from 40 to fifty BILLION dollars a year on illegals. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Illegals cost the federal government, $45,870,474,332. State and local cost for illegals is $88,992,981,032, Giving a total of, $134,863,455,364 in costs.  TERRORISM  The next topic I would like to talk about is terrorism. In 2011, a report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee found that the Canadian border is ""An easy passage into America's for; terrorists, extremists, and criminals whose purpose is clearly to harm the American people."" In July of 2014, John Kelly, Marine Corps general and U.S. southern border command said that the southern boxer has become a ""crime-terror convergence."" He said ""All this corruption and is directly or indirectly due to insatiable U.S. demand for drugs, particularly Cocaine, heroin, and now meth. All of which are produced in Latin America and smuggled into the U.S. through an incredibly efficient network along which anything, hundreds of tons of drugs, people, terrorists, or children, so long as they pay the fare.”  HUMANITARIAN  Lots of people on the left seek to open the borders. This is predictable. The left is the strongest advocates for equality. They do this by making a case for ""humanitarian' borders. These borders are no different than open borders, except with a moral superiority complex entwined into it. Humanitarians state that the borders should be open because borders seek to divide people by nationality and that humanity would be prosperous if we open our borders. This is not only wrong, it's dangerous. If we open our borders, we will be letting all the disease-infested, criminal, drug dealing humans that wish not to benefit us, but to overrun us. Humanitarians are globalists, who have no interest in helping America, or Americans. If humanitarian truly want to be humanitarians, they can be American-humanitarians. In order to stay strong and prosperous, we cannot let illegal immigrants through our borders to ravage Americans.  LEGALIZATION  The last topic I would like to discuss with you is the outcome of giving amnesty to and legalizing all the illegal immigrants. According to the American Immigration Council, legalizing all 11 million illegal immigrants will yield the largest tax revenue in U.S. history. Giving legal citizenship, whether temporary or permanent, will let them get better jobs, producing higher income, and higher tax. According to the American Immigration Council, “virtually all immigrants with legal status pay into the tax system, compared to roughly half of the undocumented. The end result is more tax revenue at all levels of government.” According to the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, stated that if all illegal immigrants had legal status, their state and local tax contributions would be $2.1 billion higher than it is, for a total of #13.8 billion dollars. This includes:  $7.6 billion in sales tax  $2.2 billion in income tax  $4 billion in property tax  According to the American Immigration Council, ""The largest increases in tax revenue resulting from legalization would be in California, Texas, New York, and Illinois."" and ""The average effective state and local tax rate of formerly undocumented immigrants granted legal status would rise from 8 to 8.6 percent."" In 3 years after legalizing, ""The higher earning power of newly legalized workers…would generate $4.5 to $5.4 billion in additional net tax revenue"" According to a study from the North American Integration and Development and the Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""This increase in tax revenue stems from the fact that ""all immigrant workers in this scenario have full labor rights, which results in higher wages—and higher worker productivity—for all workers in industries where large numbers of immigrants are employed.""  I know the reason these people come over to our country is that they are looking for a better life, but by coming over the border illegally, they have jeopardized themselves from ever being able to make a new life. If you truly want to make a better life for yourself, coming to America LEGALLY is the best and safest way to do it.  If you have finished it. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed.

"As noted by countless others, the deficit nature of the the tax reform means that either the individual tax or the corporate tax provisions must be temporary.  Why was this a strategic choice to make individual tax temporary? No, it isn't because the republicans want to tax people more later.  In layman's terms, raising individual taxes significantly damage your political career. No matter who you are, a republican or a democrat with caveats such as national emergencies.  If the republicans set the corporate tax as temporary, and by 2025, the houses has a majority democrat or a sitting democrat president, you can be sure the corporate tax reduction will not be extended.  This becomes a win for the democrats as they can claim to be tough on corporations for their base and the undecided.  However, if the individual tax reforms were the temporary provision, then the democrats are left with a lose lose scenario.  They cannot repeal the corporate tax reforms without majority in house, senate and a sitting president.  So, if they were to not extend the individual tax cuts, they would be seen as the party that taxes individuals more than corporations. This would appear as an act of betrayal to the democrat voters, and is unacceptable.  If they were to resume the tax cuts, then they gain absolutely nothing while the republicans retains the legacy as the party that gave every one a massive tax cut.  This is why the democrats hate this bill. Because they have no power in 2024+ to stop it unless they can pull a landslide victory like trump did, in all 3 houses."
"A good reason why the censorship is being ramped up on all the social media platforms is because something big is about to happen and the controlled media needs to derail the truth about what's going to unfold in the coming weeks. They don't like that fact that we are able to think for our selves and speak out against the fake news with common sense. The ruleing socialist elite feel that their future is not assured with Trump at the reigns in the White House.   In other words These people that dispise President Trump are getting louder crazier and more irrational as each day goes by. So its my personal belief that these people are going to the Try and commit as much crime as possible with such overwhelming force that It disenfranchise social order, and it will somehow be Trumps fault.

"In order to spot the Left's propaganda maneuvers, I use Google. Specifically, their Android app which also comes with news article ""recommendations"". The logic is simple: my news feed is extremely well curated. I removed noise sources (everything that is an obvious propaganda source), so whenever an overt brainwashing piece pops up, it's on the long tail of their propaganda efforts (e.g. just a few days ago, I saw an article about ""white privilege"" in ...Foreign Policy Magazine, of all places).  During the Left's character assasination attempt earlier this year (around C-PAC), suddenly a lot of Milo-related hit-pieces started showing up in my feed. This really felt like a concerted attack, aimed at filling the news space on the topic with one particular narrative.  A few days ago, I spotted it again. Culprits: MSN and SPIN magazine. They all suddenly started pushing anti-Milo propaganda that made it all the way up to my well-curated Google feed. Remember, this is just an indication that there's a lot more out there.  These things don't happen by accident. When there's a campaign against someone, it's like a push in a war, they go all in. Which means they must REALLY hate Milo right now. It just happens he's doing his Australia tour.  You may dislike the guy, but you can't say he's not effective. Especially in making the Left's propaganda machine expose itself. Be on a look-out for such patterns.  "
"Here's to another year of winning against the faulse song of globalism and islamist cucks!  Stay safe, be merry and above all else; keep being nimble navigators!  Cheers!"
"Newsweek: ""How killing terrorists is actually ahite supremacy."" NYT: ""Why Osama Bin Laden wasn't such a bad guy."" Twitter leftist; ""I wish OBL had got Trump."" Buzzfeed: ""37 reasons why Trump and the military suck."""
His posts have typos and he has Not personally verified himself yet. The Julian i have followed for 8 years sure as fuck isnt RT the Pope. Nor making typos. 
"Due your due diligence, take your extra cash and invest in companies that plan on putting America first. Look for industries that will benefit directly from tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure construction. For advanced investors, look to short globalist companies that will take a beating for their anti-american business models.   If your entrepreneurial, start a small business. Look for opportunities that capitalize on the trends were seeing. Invest in yourself and break from all out consumerism.   I can't help but think that part of our movement is to take part in the new american dream. I want to buy a home, i want to retire. This is a boom that we helped make happen, lets ensure we are the beneficiaries. This is OUR time.   /rant "
"There is the early stages of a revolution in Iran, but redacted is busy checking if a statement the president made 8 months ago is now false  No negative press on Iran, shows you who is paying the shills"
So much drama! Shit is like high school. 
"I just always find it hilarious when the leftists get on their high horse about climate change, 'OH SORRY I BELIEVE IN   S C I E N C E !!  '    but the X and Y chromosome somehow escapes them...  ""DONT GENDER MEEEEE""  RRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
After all the MSM lies and story telling regarding the Iranian protests if you read any MSM you are becoming a cuck. 
"With Dr. Cowboy President Donald Trump in office everyday feels like Christmas. Today is the real day and I have love and joy in my heart for all of you, Merry Christmas everyone. Enjoy your family and friends and share your love with everyone you contact. We are making America great again. "

I just attempted to crosspost something great.  first time.  the Dom isn't in the list.
Here in Illinois in 2018 there will be pet custody hearings for divorced.... What a joke 
I told them about their actions and why they shouldn't go full Gestapo on us pedes.  I'll keep you updated until it's taken down.  UPDATE 1: I've caused a category 1 shitstorm. It's getting stronger.
"It's like Trump supporters don't care about gender...  It's like they vote on policy, not on someone's genitalia just to have the first female President... What's it called to treat someone differently because of their sex?"

"I just had a funny thought....  Politics has become a sort of high school game of social capital because in this geopolitical age, everyone has to agree on everything. Cliques form, so everyone is watching eachother, not wanting to step out, considering scenarios primarily from the point of image.   Trump is the new guy who just doesnt care about the social hierarchy and is good at both math and sports. At first the established cliques hate him, the jocks try to make fun of him, the girls think hes gross and weird. The administration hates him cuz hes a rebel.  He makes friends with the weird homeschooled kid (mikey), the nerdy black kid (ben), the awkard spanish kid (ted), the fat kid (sorry steve) and the geeky girl (kellyanne).  Eventually he wins over most of the school and runs for council president, and after defeating his rivals mccain and obama, by proving comey has been helping them cheat on tests, he is of course is finally crowned homecoming king and takes he most beautiful girl in the school to prom (melania).

"These judges should be held accountable for their actions as well as these sanctuary cities / or the state of California in general which manage to outcuck even Canada and Sweden with their absolutely insane ""laws"" or lack thereof.

"One particular Christmas season a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for his annual trip but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her Mom was coming to visit; this stressed Santa even more.     When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out at heaven knows where. More stress.     Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hid the liquor and there was nothing to drink.     In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffeepot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made of. Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.     The angel said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Isn't it just a lovely tree? Where would you like me to stick it?    Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the tree.  "
"*Some weed in your car?* **Nah you fucked.**  **Murder someone while being illegal?** ***You okay!***  How are they going to tell anyone of color that they are still a ""priority"" when you can fucking come in illegally MULTIPLE TIMES and straight murder someone and get away with it  "

"THIS HAS TO BE A SHITPOST FROM ONE OF US, RIGHT?  - - - - - - - - - - - - -   ""Tell them to 'SHUT the FUCK up.'  No, really.  The problem with Democrat messaging is their strange obsession with appearing reasonable or nice. So long as they keep taking that ""high road"", people will see reason in their words and switch to their side.  ...But that is not how Republican voters operate. They do not listen to and consider rational arguments. They respond solely to emotion and forceful authority. Their primary goal is to appear ""right"" above all else.  And on the same token, they are terrified of appearing to be wrong.  They need to be told, in no ambiguous terms, that Republican congressmen and Fox News are wrong. Not ""they're saying things which are false"", but ""those FUCKING LIARS don't have a GODDAMN CLUE and need to STFU"".  But not on the internet. To their faces.  Always remember, _they are the minority_. And I don't mean 49% minority. Trump had less than 26% support of the voting population on _election day_.  Being surrounded by a majority saying ""you're WRONG shut the HELL up"" tends to change people whose primary concern is appearing right.  Also keep in mind that this isn't _being_ right. But _appearing_ right. The more forceful one is with their statements, the more they _appear_ right to those susceptible to emotional authority.  Fox News and other alt-right cranks speak the way they do because _it works_.  Democrats twiddling their fingers and murmuring something about pigs and mud will keep losing until they they realize that their ideals of ""being better"" aren't worth the damage being done to the country. They can not win elections from the high road. It's just not how the game is set up.""  - - - - - - - -    Oh my HEAVENS!!! Please, pleeeease...let the Democrats get even more violent and ugly!

"https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/12/09/the-new-fbi-agency-everyone-forgot-did-adam-schiff-just-get-caught-in-an-elaborate-counterintelligence-sting/  By now everyone is likely aware of the Fake News story run by CNN on Friday surrounding an email received by Donald Trump Jr.  The email was part of the investigative evidence shared with the House Intelligence committee; and later leaked from within that committee to CNN – thereby initiating the false reporting on the content.  The central issue in the CNN story was the date of an email.  It was leaked from within the committee, and later reported by CNN, that the date was “September 4th, 2016”; a date convenient for a collusion narrative between Trump Jr and WikiLeaks.  However, the real date, on the actual email, was “September 14th, 2016”; a day after Wikileaks published the content of their DNC leaks and a date that makes the entire CNN report a ‘nothingburger’.  However, CNN reports that two independent sources originally leaked to them the contents of what they had seen on the email in question.  But CNN never saw the email, until later in the day.  Think about this carefully.  ♦Two “independent sources” both looked at an email, and both came away from reading that email with the wrong date?   How is that possible?  It has been CTH contention for several weeks that a counterintelligence sting operation has been going on within the IC community.  False trails of information, seeded by ‘White Hat’ investigators, intended to be captured by ‘Black Hat’ leakers – and delivered to their usurping allies in media.  The stories are fake, the leaks are real.  All investigative documents, relating to the witness, are provided to the congressional committees prior to the interviews with the witnesses; or, if the information is classified, each committee member has an opportunity to review the documents via a controlled SCIF environment when no physical copies are allowed as part of the evidence.  The Don JR./Wikileaks email could very easily be part of a ‘sting’.  The date was intentionally seeded as incorrect.  The resulting story is fake. The leak, however, is real.  Each nugget of disinformation exposes a specific leaker.  Each trail used in the sharing of that disinformation exposes the enabling media.  The White Hat plants the fake news seed, and then watches to see where, when, how, to-whom, and from-whom, it shows up.  n this example, we believe it is most likely House Intelligence Committee Minority Chairman Adam Schiff was the recipient of the disinformation, and has now exposed himself as a leaker to an elite, previously undisclosed, investigative unit specifically assembling evidence of corruption and leaking at the highest levels of government.  The scale and strength of the CNN push-back, and specifically the tone in their refusal to even consider discussing source of the false information, further supports our supposition.  Keep in mind, Representative Adam Schiff is -as an outcome of his minority ranking on the House Intel Committee- a member of the elite congressional oversight “Gang of Eight”.  This is a VERY BIG deal.  The Gang of Eight holds oversight on every covert intelligence operation going on around the world.  The Go8 oversee the NSA, CIA, FBI, DNI, and every single intelligence unit and operation.  The Go8 are the only group with oversight on the CIA action from Presidential Finding Memos authorizing covert operations.  The back-story to CTH theory on this endeavor includes an almost complete, years-long, Dept of Justice Office Inspector General investigation that no-one was paying attention to until recently.  And don’t forget the ongoing FBI investigation into the Awan Brothers, and the quantifying the potential intelligence compromise, plays into this.  That said, it would not be the IG carrying out the counterintelligence operation to identify leakers.  In actuality, no official IC agency would be empowered to place fake news in front of congress.  Setting traps for congress is generally bad form, and for matters of trust – bad politics.  That reality, amid those who follow DC politics, is the central point to dismiss such the “Black Hat Hunting” theory.  However, few people were paying attention four months ago when Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates told us they were going to do exactly that:  04:30 …”The FBI has created a new counterintelligence unit to manage these [leak] cases”…  08:17 …”these National Security breaches do not just originate from within the Intelligence Community. They come from a wide range of sources within the government, including the Congress.”…  Two days later, Sunday August 6th, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein reiterated he was going to follow through on the investigative demand of AG Sessions and DNI Coates and again referenced a “new counterintelligence division within the FBI”.  00:50 …“we’re responding appropriately. We’re going to devote more resources, re-evaluate our procedures and make sure we investigate every one of those leaks in an appropriate way.”…  1:07 “We have seen a surge in referrals (of leaks). We’ve seen an increase in the number of leaks. And we’re going to respond appropriately and try to establish an effective deterrent. Criminal prosecution isn’t the only way to prevent leaks but it’s an important part of the solution.”…  1:43 “That significant increase has necessitated an increase in resources. And so we have re-prioritized our cases within the National Security Division, we’re providing appropriate supervision at a high level, we’ve created a new unit within the FBI to focus on those leaks, and we’re going to devote whatever resources are necessary to get them under control.”…  Visit the link for additional info'   "

"I believe this is a witch hunt and that Trump is innocent.  And I want Mueller gone and in prison.  But within the last couple weeks Ive come to think that Trump firing Mueller would be the most stupid decision Trump could make at this point.  He's innocent so he either has to trust that Mueller is by the book and will find no evidence, because no crime was committed and that will come out and Trump will be exonerated.  Or that Mueller is one of our guys and is secretly working on getting Podesta/Comey/Clinton and will shock the world, or that the revelations to the public as we've seen these last few weeks about FBI corruption will continue and the investigation and investigators will be so tarnished and exposed by the revelations that the investigation will be shut down or ordered to be shut down.    Firing Mueller has to come from Rosenstein or Sessions.  Not Trump.  I sadly think Trump firing Mueller would be the end of Trump.  Its not right but thats what would happen.    Trump has to stay the course on this.  And that is painful and ridiculous and unfair, since this is a witch hunt.    But he has to stay calm and stay the course.  Let it take its course.  "

"Was re-watching Trumps great speech at Alfred Smith Dinner - he made a comment I didn't catch before. Trump refers to Killary spending the 4th of July weekend with (then) FBI Director Comey.   There's been an increasing drip of info sent out by POTUS (i.e. McCabe, Obama Hezbollah, etc). The FBI even came out recently saying to expect no new motive info until 2018 (midterms red pill??) for the Vegas shooting.  Guys... is the storm actually REAL? Is it actually HAPPENING?  *gulps*  To add to my timeline observations - Trump didn't even make ""the storm"" comments until after Gen. K came in and cleaned house. Plugged the leaks, etc. Until it was safe to move forward.  "

""The Clinton’s have thrown principle out the window in exchange for cold hard cash...putting money ahead of principle.”  * Hillary's Chief of Staff admits in the 2nd link that foreign interests sway Hillary to do what they want her to do (money for mandatory appearances).  She also admits that the ""Friend of Hillary"" list is available and rentable to people who want to influence, but that it’s too sensitive to talk in email. * This leak shows Hillary knows Saudis and Qatar are funding ISIS, which is an enemy of the state.  After knowing this, Hillary accepted tens of millions in donations from these terrorist-funding governments (of course they are getting something back in return). She also supported arms deals to them. * Saudi Arabia and Qatar commit horrible acts under Sharia law, including throwing gay people off of buildings, persecuting Christians, Jews, and atheists, and making it legal to rape and beat women. They are the leading funders of Hillary and her campaign through the Clinton Foundation.   #5 Hillary's campaign wants ""unaware"" and ""compliant"" citizens  * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599 * “And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.”  * The Clinton campaign is literally conspiring to keep the population unaware of what is going on, and they admitted it in this email. Very scary ‘1984’ level thinking (group-think). If Hillary is the right choice for president and the truth is on her side, they should encourage their supporters to be aware and do research on both candidates.  #6  Hillary deleted her incriminating emails. State covered it up. Asked      about using White House executive privilege to hide from Congress.  * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9272#efmBI2BOJ * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545 * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34370 * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32007 * ""They do not plan to release anything publicly, so no posting online or anything public-facing, just to the committee."" * ""That of course includes the emails Sid turned over that HRC didn't, which will make clear to them that she didn't have them in the first place, deleted them, or didn't turn them over. It also includes emails that HRC had that Sid didn't.” * “Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will.” * ""We brought up the existence of emails in reserach this summer but were told that everything was taken care of."" * ""That of course includes the emails Sid turned over that HRC didn't, which will make clear to them that she didn't have them in the first place, deleted them, or didn't turn them over.""  * The State Department was:     * (1) Coordinating with the Clinton political campaign.     * (2) Colluding with the press to spin it positively.     * (3) Doing so BEFORE they released it to AN EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. The Clinton campaign was always a step ahead of the committee investigating them. Shameful. * Nick states ""Just spoke to State"" He goes on to reveal that State colluded with him about which emails are being revealed to committee and that the State plans to plant a story with AP. * Shows intent to withhold emails from the subpoena * #7 ‘The Huffington Post’ colluded with Hillary  * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5988 * “I am committed to make sure she is elected as the next President of United States. I am reaching out to my friends to raise money for her campaign. Please let me know if I can be of any service to you.” * No doubt the entirety of Huffington Post is in it for Hillary when they display their ""disclaimer"" (""Donald Trump is a racist, sexist, homophobe Hitler"" or something along these lines) under every ""article.”  * The author of this email once an ""article"" on the Huffington Post that Trump was “a sorcerer and a wizard”. Yes... Huffington Post actually  published this.  That's why no one takes The Huffington Post seriously.  #7 Hillary had a mole working on Biden’s team  * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5690 * ""It's been a little hard for me to play such a role in the Biden demise - and I am definitely dead to them -- but I'm glad to be on Team HRC”  * Earlier leaks revealed Clinton’s staff had moles on Elizabeth Warren's team. Seems they had one in Biden's camp as well. Someone who helped to destroy Biden in return for a position. Ron Klain. *  *  #8Hillary’s team working with hundreds of MSM news pundits  * https://www.wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/5636 (in attachments) * “IMPACTING THE DIALOGUE: CTR has identified 372 surrogates including influential and frequent pundits on broadcast and cable news for Presidential 2016 politics and provided them around 80 sets of talking points…”  * Once again, shows the media collusion with the Hillary campaign. * #9 Proof that ‘Correct the Record’ (SuperPAC) is directly coordinating        with the Hillary campaign against federal campaign law  * https://www.wikileaks.com/podesta-emails/emailid/5636 (in attachments) * “In May of 2015, CTR separated from its parent organization, American Bridge, and became its own SuperPAC.  This structure allows CTR to retain its independence but coordinate directly and strategically with the Hillary campaign. This work is necessary now more than ever.”  * Correct the Record (CTR) is a group funded by globalist billionaire George Soros to pretend Hillary has support online.  They pay “an army of nerd virgins” (their own words) to create memes and pretend to support Hillary.  On popular internet sites like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, they are paid to ‘downvote’ or ‘dislike’ or delete anything pro-Trump/anti-Hillary, and fake-promote anything pro-Hillary/anti-Trump.  Incredibly sad, but Hillary and her “support” is staged in every department. * The same attachment describes everything   *  #9 Hillary's team admitting she lies a lot  * https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3990 * “Beyond this Hillary should stop attacking Bernie, especially when she says things that are untrue, which candidly she often does.”  * As we found out in other leaks, Hillary is “often confused”.   #10 Hillary’s camp excited about a black teen’s murder (to help her        agenda)  * https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25750 * “This is great.” * “Davis was killed by a white man.”  * Disgusting. I wish all Americans would see this, the democratic strategists drooling over the opportunity to drive a wedge of racial hatred between the races in America to maximize their political advantage.         "

"This commercial,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxuuIPcQ9_I  is CNN totally showing their hand with this ad. Take for example the case outlined in the title of this post. A middle class guy gets a little extra cash and decides that he is going to pretend to be rich in order to attract attention and maybe a hot, yet gullible, girl to sleep with him. He'll spend all his extra cash to carry this charade on, if only for this one day. In reality he is a loser. He's a loser because he isn't being genuine. He's a loser because he needs to trick other people into believing that he is something that he is not. He's a loser because he could have saved or invested that money in much wiser ways. A wealthy person does not need, nor would they want, to announce that they are wealthy.   CNN is guilty of this in releasing this ad. Why would they even NEED to release this ad if what it espouses were true? If it were true, people would just naturally agree, left or right, that what they do is report real unbiased factual news. Day by day more and more people are figuring out that this just isn't the case. This ad didn't help them, it only made them look weaker because they are a bunch of losers."
"I recently just got out of a relationship with a great girl but we just weren't right for each other.  A big part of my reasoning was our different political beliefs but that wasn't all of it.

I figure it was a good way to REALLY sift out people with liberal beliefs because in my experience the women who like Trump are the most sensible.  Although I live in northwest florida near the destin area (I've seen some pedes post the Emerald Grand on here) there are still a lot of liberal minded women here with ""more than 2 gender, blue hair, feminazi"" beliefs.   I swear, if I met a conservative woman that was wife material and loved our president and shared my beliefs, I would feel less alone in this seemingly orwellian future we are heading towards.

"Hey pedes, did a bit of number crunching, and what I found is pretty good news.  In early 2009, the stock market had just crashed and rested at  #$6,626.93  I'll be nice and give Obummer until early 2017, so as of January 6, 2017, the stock market had increased about three-fold to  #$19,963.80, an average increase of $1,667 per year  That 19K figure is what we're starting President Trump with, as confidence from his win had already started to stimulate markets. We're at about 10.5 months into his presidency, so this average is a bit different. **At the monthly rate, the stock market increase had an average of $401.20**  If we were to count 10.5 months as a year, that means his yearly increase is   #$4,212.59 which averages to an increase of about $19k per term*, or $38K for BOTH TERMS!!  MAGA!  SPEZ: the 19k per term came from applying the monthly average (401.20) to a 48-month period and then of course doubling it because  #TWO TERMS | TWO SCOOPS | TWO GENDERS"

"Reading all the articles regarding the shooting of Kate Steinle - all I see regarding the shooter is that he is an ""Undocumented Immigrant"". A few years ago we called them Illegal Immigrant and when I was younger, they were Illegal Aliens.   The Left and Politicians have invented a soft language that keeps people docile and downplays reality; a lot of leftists believe that as if changing the word will change the condition. An undocumented immigrant sounds nicer than illegal alien. Illegal Alien sounds like something you DON'T want in your country - but an Undocumented Immigrant victimizes the perpetrator of the crime.

You know one would think if you were sitting in the top tiers of the tax bracket you would be doing everything in your power to pass reform that gives yourself better tax breaks. Yet the left hates trumps plan so much because it's only going to help the 1%? What kind of mental gymnastics do you have to perform in order to obstruct action that supposedly benefits you? This is a big red pill for me that tax reform really is goibg to be a benefot for the middle class if the left and MSM is lying this much about what it will really be centered around.

President Obama failed to follow transition laws forcing President Elect Trump to initiate contacts with world leaders on his own. There is nothing wrong or unusual with incoming Presidents doing this in fact congressional laws mandate the incumbent to assist them and if Obama didnt he broke the law.    The Presidential transition act of 1963  specifically authorizes  &gt;  ( 5) Communications services found necessary by the President-elect or Vice-President-elect;  There are no restriction on those communciations  to forbide contact with foreign leaders or ambassadors.  https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/presidential-transition/legislative-overview/presidential-transition-act-of-1963   In 2010 congress improved that to force incumbent presidents to cooperate with incoming presidents  http://archive.fo/Iwdt3  In March of 2016 congress was so concerned about Obama's apparent reluctance to help his successor no matter who they were that Congress passed another transition law to force him to do what he should do for the nation.  http://archive.fo/7Ik1q  The evidence is that Obama failed to follow the law probably because he never thought Trump would win and so expected not to have to cover up his crimes with Clinton during the transition. When President Elect Trump won Obama couldnt give President Elect Trump's team open access as required by law because President Elect Trump's team would have quickly discovered the multiple surveillence crimes and state department crimes and FBI crimes and others.

Obamas Government was in charge. It was his duty to protect that election process. The original conspiracy from the Democrats is that Putin colluded with Trump to beat killary.

I think this will play out differently than his “supporters” think. Right now he is a “civil rights pioneer” of the day. But what happens after the Super Bowl when teams trim rosters. And every player thats makes between 3-10 million dollars but are mid level players gets cut. Because NFL owners dont tolerate losing money. So that 5 million dollar linebacker just became expendable and the rookie from Florida for $400k looks really good. See the profits and losses arent figured in yet. Tickets. Concessions. Merch. Parking. Tv revenue. All that will affect 2018 rosters. When 300 black males lose their high paying jobs... who has the last laugh... the players? The owners? Nope. We do.

"Guess the censorship was getting a little too obvious, even for Reddit. Feels good to be back!"
What if Flynn is being primed to say Trump told him in a phone call after he was fired he would get the FBI to let him off the hook.  Mueller then could use this and Comey`s claim that he was fired to stop the investigation.  Is that obstruction of justice?  Mueller is a piece of shit.  Hope this is not possible.

"Many of them did not know the difference between a telecom that operated a backbone connecting IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) and a local ISP that connects end users.    I think the way big tech lobbies have tricked users into supporting Net Neutrality is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the internet in the US.    The biggest thing holding the internet back is how outdated our privately owned infrastructure is becoming. Having companies act like Utilities does not give them the funds or the incentive to upgrade, plus does not solve price gouging issues that arise from the willing monopolies the companies agree to.    Here's what needs to happen:    1) Repeal NN from private companies    2) ENFORCE current Antitrust laws against telecoms working as monopolies or in anti-competitive agreements.   3) More federal and state laid backbone between IXPs treat it like the Interstate Highway System, which of course would follow NN like rules. Expand as needed for traffic in much the same way civil planning takes place for updating highways where needed most.    This creates a lot more room for not only competition but also would create the necessary infrastructure for local ISPs to expand and new companies to come into play in connecting end users to exchange points."

"Firstly, it's in the public. You would want to keep this hidden so that Trump wouldn't get spooked.   Secondly and most importantly, Flynn is being charged with lying, on top of lying to Pence, you don't charge your star witness with lying.

"I stumbled across [this](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29558) record of Woodrow Wilson's fifth State Of The Union address from 100 years ago today and it really struck a chord, I figured the folks here might enjoy reading it too. There were fears of foreign propaganda, protests against wartime policies, concerns about congress meddling with the economy, security concerns about undocument immigrants, and a host of other parallels. Here are some of my favorite excerpts:  &gt; As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent; who does not? I hear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature not the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. But I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten.  and   &gt; It will be necessary to extend in certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I believe, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons into and from the United States.

"All of you have heard about Donald trump an entrepreneur,  , a family man, and now the president of the united states.  He has greatly impacted my life, and all of yours, as well. One thing I love about trump, is that he so great at making money, trump was given a small loan of a million dollars by his father, and he managed to  turn that million dollars into billions. Trump may not be the smartest man out their when it comes to science or math, but when it comes to business sense he blows most people out of the water. Trump has inspired me to go into business, and investing, and I have made a good amount of money because of the inspiration I have gained from Trump’s brilliant business strategy. People say Trump is a draft dodger, but think about it this way, if trump went to Vietnam and got his self-killed, he would have never created tens of thousands of jobs for Americans, or run for president and make America great again. Trump is a long term thinker and knows what is best for his country  Another thing I like about Donald trump is he says whatever the hell he wants. For example when trump was campaigning for the election, he said “We are going to build a wall and Mexico is gonna pay for it” This character trait of not being politically correct is something I really love, because these days you have to think about everything  you say so you don’t offend some random minority, but Trump he doesn’t care because  when you are rich as him you can do almost anything without consequences. During the debate Trump was able to keep the debates entertaining and tense, he would insult his competition, put them down, and use his wit to bring his status up, he had no problem calling out  CNN, NCBC for creating fake news, and spreading lies among the American people. Trump will tweet anything that comes to his head, and is more relatable to the average American, than say Obama or Clinton. Some of my favorite isults by him are “lightweight rubio”, Low energy jeb, and crooked Hillary.  The final thing I will say about trump is that he really respects our military When Trump campaigned to be president, he knew that Obama was weakening our military by defunding it, and he knew if he could lure in military people to vote for him he could become the president of the united states, so trump started to promise more funding for our military, and talked about how our veterans are getting nothing while the US is sending money abroad to countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, instead of using it to build our military. In fact trump gave a 25000 check to the father of a killed soldier just out of his generosity. Trump has avoided going to war in places such as north  Korea and Ukraine, which has saved the lives of many Americans because and we all know that a whole lot of soldiers would be  defecating their pants if they knew they would be sent to Korea. Trump has removed Obama’s generals, who do not know anything about winning wars,  So to sum up why Trump is an inspiration  to me, he created a lot of money with a small loan, and helped build the American economy, he says whatever is on his mid, and finally he supports our military   	 "

""Russian bots"" did not convince me to support Trump. Russian bots did not make me think Hillary was crooked. Russian bots did not change my vote.  What I HAVE witnessed is news outlets continuously being dishonest, misleading, and sometimes outright false. Over 90% of Trump's news coverage is negative. The nanny state funded BBC is no exception. Every late night comedy show is ant-Trump none-sense. It is absolutely outrageous.  # So Mr. Cameron, with much love, PISS OFF MATE  -An American"
"In particular I was thinking of helping [St.Jude Children's Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/). For those that don't know what St.Jude, it is a state of the art hospital (the only one of it's class) that treats children with cancer at no cost to the family. It provides free housing during the treatments, free transportation to and from appointments, hosts events on the campus for the patients, has a lot of deals for free attractions (i.e. free entrance to the Zoo, buys a bunch of Christmas gifts for the kids in the hospital for Christmas) and feeds the patients and family all free. It accepts patients from around the world, and it's motivational statement is ""No child should ever die in the dawn of life."" .   So with all that being said, I think we could buy St. Jude Merchandise (the profits go to support St.Jude) now (just in case it has to ship to you) and post pictures of it on The_Donald on a selected day closer to Christmas. I feel like this is a great way to make America Great Again! Give to a great cause to help great patriots do great work.  If you are interested in this please feel free to click the link below.

"My stepfather is a farmer and the hardest worker I know. He's been an NFL fan for 50 years. Every Sunday, he would come home after church and watch football all day long. He especially loved the redzone channel and Peyton Manning. It was his 'hobby' and something he always loved.   This year, it shocked me when he dropped his NFL redzone subscription, and told me he was done. I thought he was just going through a phase, but the season is almost over, and he has yet to even watch a game. He tells me that he intentionally avoids the channels that he knows NFL football comes on, just in case it ends up being on that channel during the game and it's even on in the house. He's that disgusted. When I asked him why (I knew why, I just wanted to hear him say it), he said, ""People have died for them to make a living playing that game. To use that as a platform for political grandstanding is disgusting and out of line. They are free to do what they want, but I'm free to never tune into another game for as long as I live""  The NFL, and sports in general, was built on the support of the working middle class, but their spoiled brat players have set them down a course that is going to take a lot of PR to fix. My stepdad is simply a representation of millions of middle class people around the country, of every race.   I was playing in a recreational soccer league last weekend, and someone made a hard tackle, to which I said ""this is like the NFL"". An older latino gentleman on the opposing team said ""NFL? F**k those spineless SOBs."" They've turned away millions.   The NFL is like the Titantic, they thought they were too big to fail, but guess what, they've run their arrogant noses into an iceberg, and now they're paying the price. "

"We are a fast paced news organization who speak in a vacuum to white liberals with enormous amounts of white guilt.   We are looking for someone who can write about their hate for white people, you must be a go getter, and an extremely tolerant liberal who voted for Obama and Hillary Clinton.   Qualifications:   Woman  Black preferably but must be angry.   4 year college degree but it must be in something not useful. Business degrees are racist.   Be able to see racism or sexism in all facets of life, even when it doesn’t exist, which is 99% of the time.   Experience in copying and pasting from New York Times.   Looking for talented and experienced poll takers, and by polls we mean asking the first five people you see in the office, and assuming the rest of the country feels the same way.   Be able to get to work by 10am and leaving by 2pm. Working longer hours promotes capitalism, and we are not racist here.   Must be able to drink heavily on your one hour lunch, we need you sharp and aware just in case Donald Trump sends out a tweet. Must have an account with Twitter, with verifiable posts about your hate for white people.   Also not required, but we do encourage, a lot of gay and lesbian sex in the off hours from the office. Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Rachel Maddow are legends in our business, and it wouldn’t be without their ability to have enormous amounts of gay sex in the off hours from work.

"I’m not angry about the movie, but more so about the fact that they kept referring to me with the characters in the movie since I was the only white person in the room. I think it’s a great concept and totally shows how mostly the dems act towards African Americans by saying “oh I voted for Obama” and having the white people try and make connections through their blackness.  I want to make a movie about the 4 adults that kidnapped that one mentally ill boy. I want to call it “come in” it will be a story of a mentally ill white boy living in a mostly black neighborhood showing the racism he deals with on a day to day basis and gets invited to come over by these 2 girls. Then it spends most the time on how they torture him from his point of view. And then the after effects of how  he is hated on by social media and people tell him he deserved it.   If anyone takes the idea and makes it that would be awesome cause I’m kinda lazy."

"All over Europe and the UK, and now Canada as well, people are being jailed simply for daring to publicly voice normal mundane right leaning opinions. If you live in one of these places, start calling the pol;ice every time you see a feminist post on Twatter that she likes killing babies and wants to teach your kids how to be gay. If you see them posting threats to people for having right leaning views, take it seriously and call the police, tell them you are terrified for your children's safety. These people are dangerous, they have proven so many times.  If you are in a university and you hear your professor talking about the merits of communism, or how we need to ""end whiteness"", go to the administration and report it as a violent hate crime. Tell them you no longer feel safe on campus.  Don't protest their events by throwing bricks through windows and getting the riot police to shut it down. That shit is counter-productive and stupid. But use their own levers of power which they put in place to be used against us. Turn their whole damn political and social authoritarian machine against them.  They grant us no quarter, it's time we stop capitulating for them. This isn't a game, they are ruining people's lives and they hold themselves up as examples of moral virtue while they do it."

This is mildly off topic so forgive me but I recently got into a debate with my apush teacher on voter fraud and the need for voter ID. Basically she just said my claims had no evidence and I was wondering if any of you guys have any definitive evidence I could use. Thanks for any help.

I bet this cuck is 100% okay with Muslims screaming about murdering Jews and other infidels in the streets of Europe, but he gets all offended when someone says something bad about Muslims.   This guy is the exact person who is leading the downfall of Europe. Muslims will take over Europe and cucks like him are letting it happen. He thinks he'll be okay since he ""supported"" them.

"The fact that the FBI was partisan, the fact that the steele dossier was a fraud, the fact that the Mueller investigation was a joke ...we've been talking about this for close to 8 months.    Why the hell is the MSM and congress just now digging into this stuff?  "
"TL:DR -- You want to stop the next Hitler?  Keep America from becoming the next Weimar Republic.  GTFO Obama!  To Barack Obama: Repent!  Hitler rose to power out of a specific set of circumstances:  1) An extended period of economic stagnation and negative growth: The financial situation of the German worker went from terrible to absolutely abysmal in the days between World War I and World War II.  Anyone who was prudent enough to save had their savings wiped out by hyper inflation.  German families and workers were starving to death whilst working themselves to death.  The money they were earning wasn't worth the paper it was printed on.  Under your own leadership we had 0 years of 3+ percent economic growth GDP wise.  Median household income fell while more and more money was spent on welfare programs and illegal immigrants.  You not only failed to help the American working family but actively sabotaged them by raising taxes, enacting Obamacare fining Americans for not purchasing a product that was both useless and unaffordable whilst lying to them every step of the way.  You enacted heaps upon heaps of regulations that made it harder for Americans to find better jobs and for companies to provide said jobs.  You stifled investment and even shafted investors during the GM bankruptcy.  The MF Global scandal happened under your watch... which made the Enron scandal look like a drop in the bucket.  Your buddy who also happened to be the CEO of MF Global got off scott free... hell you even promoted him to the SEC.  2) The Germans also suffered an extended period of civil tension and conflict during that same timeframe: Russian Soviets, marxists, and other never-do-wells did everything they could to stir up divisions and strife among the German people.  This civil conflict not only made the economic downturn worse (and made it last throughout the roaring 20's... where the German Worker continued to get poorer while the rest of the world grew richer) but it had a human toll in the form of lives lost and lives shattered as a result of said losses.  Not only did you stir up racial tensions during your time in office but now the Left is taking it to a new extreme by supporting domestic terrorists (Antifa for the most part).  Furthermore you have shadowed our President on his foreign diplomatic trips.  Why?  You're no longer the president but you still meet with world leaders.  What are you up to!?  3) In the end the German People were forced to choose between bad and worse.  The bad?  National socialism.  Worse?  International Socialism.  They chose national socialism because at least the national socialists were paying lip service specifically to the German worker... whereas the international socialists were not.  The period of economic porverty and political violence had taken it's toll: there were no longer any legitimate parties or candidates who could take power without their hands drenched in the blood of his fellow Germans.  In light of this... the end result was far too predictable.  In 2008 we had a choice between two globalists.  In 2012 we had a choice between two globalists.  Then Donald J Trump (who had finally had enough like the rest of us) declared ""We will no longer surrender this country or it's people to the false song of globalism.""  Having finally been given a clear choice between those who would sell our country for filthy lucre as opposed to a man who **truly loved us and his country** our choice was clear.  We chose the latter and **Thank GOD ALMIGHTY** that he won!  # REPENT"

I have a look at the sub count very rarely. I noticed over the past 6 months it has barely gone up by a few thousand.

"Twas the night before Christmas at our beautiful White house,  No swamp creatures were stirring, Trump threw them all out.  The rooms, decorated by our First Lady with care, In hopes that GEPOTUS soon would be there. Americans so happy all safe in their beds, With the border wall growing like the dreams in their heads.  My Mom in pajamas and Dad with MAGA cap, Had just settled in for a nice little nap. Then right on the TV there arose such a clatter, Dad jumped from his chair to see what was the matter! He grabbed the remote and turned up the sound, Our great President was on with something about to go down! He was dressed in his suit, and classic red tie. My Mom took a look and I heard a happy sigh.  It appears an announcement was reaching my ear, Our President saying we had no more to fear. He took down the Clintons, the Podestas, and George Soros, All the traitors, the fake news and scary tomorrows. With the help of the pedes, and the memes they create, He said now good-bye to the evil deep State. He thanked all of Reddit especially Pepe, the autists the chans the whole group got covfefe. Lets MAGA together and from this night forward,  We say 'Merry Christmas' And Win...until we are too tired to win any more! So much winning! Merry Christmas Everyone!

"Hi! So - First a story. I had a friend come over for the first time in like two years and for whatever reason one thing or another led to politics  She started hating on the tax plan because it now taxes some sort of teaching required to earn a PHD..? Though it benefits her and her family tremendously. She didn’t explain it so I dunno.. then out of nowhere  “Dude.. it’s proven.. you’re a white, cisgender, male you have all the privilege and life is easy.. and you commit most of the crimes. Capitalistic America is destroying society, fuck the wall, we need to help everyone”  Yeah.. so I decided I’d let her feel she’s right and gather data rather than argue like an idiot.  Before leaving she whipped out a statistic showing white people committing 60% of crimes while blacks commit 30%  I said yeah sure, 12% of the population commits 30% while 72% commits 60%. She ignored it and spouted off some other ignorant shit about how whites are evil and you can’t be racist against whites because they’re the god oppressors and more shit regurgitated from CNN.  I was more shocked than anything but I kept totally cool and told her I’m open to new ideas as long as there is data to back. So we agreed, she’s going to send me her studies.  Has anybody here complied or saved a list of redpills that covers these topics she brought up? I mean detailed as well with factual data. I can research the nets and TD for data but if it’s been done I’d like to save that time. Plus you guys make damn good compilations.  Either way I’ll start if it hasn’t been done. She’ll be a fellow pede before she knows it.  MAGA"

"First of all let me preface this by saying my family is very active in visiting our countries National Parks, we have those passbooks for the stamps and everything.   The reason this reduction does not scare me is because for the past decade or more our government has had what amounts to a hoarding problem. Protecting land left and right with no real good reasons. If you are an avid user of our parks you may have noticed that many times these area's have absolutely no infrastructure, no roads, no parks, no nothing. These area's are basically being shuttered up and closed off to 99% of the population.   The big kicker is this, and why the President is reversing some of these oversteps. Every time millions of acres of land gets set aside for ""preservation"" you drive a knife a little deeper into our countries economic backbone.   The companies and people we are so afraid to let use this land are also the same people who spend private money to set up their own preservation area's and parks.   I think I'm rambling a little bit now but anyway I wouldn't be so worried about these reversals."

So whats the game plan? Try to impeach a president for firing a politicized FBI director who was on a witch hunt instigated by a political opponent? Is that what US politics has become?  So for the next election, we can fabricate fraudulent accusations against the Democrat candidate, and install a highly politically compromised FBI director who will attempt to bring down and impeach that Democrat based on those false accusations, and if they dare to put an end to it, we'll impeach them anyways for Obstruction?"

"During the publication of the Podesta emails a thread was uncovered discussing a [farm owned by Tamera Luzzatto](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39175). Podesta was invited to dinner and a mention is made that swimming children would provide entertainment. Tamera Luzzatto is currently married to David J. Leiter.   &gt;David Leiter (ML Strategies lobbyist for Exxon and a Clinton bundler), the former Senate chief of staff to John Kerry, is also a lobbyist for Burisma Holdings, a private Ukrainian natural gas and uranium mining company with many connections to the Democratic Party. Biden’s son Hunter joined Burisma’s board in 2014, right before Leiter was hired to lobby members about the role of the company in Ukraine (arguing for its role in helping Ukraine be independent of Russia). Another board member, Devon Archer, is a Clinton donor (2700). FTI’s Lawrence Pacheco does communications for Burisma. Burisma is owned by a Cypriot holding firm, Brociti Investments Ltd, which is controlled by Nikolai Zlochevskyi, a former Ukrainian government minister.   Now while reading Let Trump Be Trump (book by Corey Lewandowski and Dave Bossie) I came across the following passage:   &gt;“Then there was the strange and murky case of Left Hand Enterprises LLC. In May 2016, after Manafort joined the campaign, and before they fired Corey, the campaign operated on two separate budgets. Corey oversaw the funds in one, and Manafort managed the other. Soon after the campaign hired Manafort, his budget quickly cut successive checks totaling over $700,000 to a newly formed Delaware company that was supposed to provide direct mail to Nebraska and Indiana. Whether or not the mailing found its way to those states, or to any other location, is still up for debate. What is known is that Left Hand LLC had a mailing address at a farm in Virginia that just happened to be the voting residence of Manafort’s former business partner.”  Based on this it appears that Manafort actually stole $700k from President Trump with the help of some of his harshest enemies (Podesta, Luzzatto, etc.). Does anyone have more information on this or has it been investigated? The more we learn the more it looks like Manafort was a plant or actively working against the Trump campaign. "

"First off we can't deny that these sexual allegations played a role in Moore's defeat. 50 percent of mothers polled said it was an important issue, with 40 percent of men saying it was important.  But even with the sexual allegations aside Moore could not court moderate Republicans, with 1 in 5 moderate Republicans voting for Jones. That spells disaster for any Republican hoping to win in the general. Additionally Blacks voted almost unanimously for Jones. Compare those numbers with Trump in 2016 and you'll see more minorities voted Republican than ever before and former Democrats voted Trump which helped Trump win decisive states.  Why did this happen? Because Moore didn't step outside his comfort zone and he tried to win a general election with only Trump supporters. You can't win that way you need a message that appeals to large swath of the population, and this is something Trump did well.   Source: http://archive.is/3nCeA"

"#�� Hello Centipedes! ��  /u/Medically here to deliver tonight's festive LNC! There are many things ahead of this week, but first, let's get into the ��**Christmas spirit**!��  To start the festivity off, we are currently running a The_Donald header contest! We're looking for the dankest of dank OC to use as the header of the dom!  The [contest thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7ixotf/the_donald_christmas_header_contest_is_officially/) will run until **tomorrow at midnight!** Winner will receive a special Christmas flair! (and their header displayed at the top of the DOM, of course ��) ___________________________________________________________  In addition to the Christmas spirit, we have a SUPER high energy week ahead of us, 'pedes! The Alabama election will take place on Tuesday, December 12th. Make sure to GO OUT AND VOTE just like we did on November 8th!! Screw the polls and vote for Roy Moore! ([don't chew soap though...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rZD7AFoSPw)) In addition to the election, the Net Neutrality vote will take place on December 14th. After the multiple Soros-funded brigaids here on reddit, and the nation-wide shilling to save net neutrality, it is clear that NN is *not* what we need to keep implemented. Here is a great [comprehensive breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7fq8uw/supreme_red_pill_comprehensive_breakdown_of_the/) of the Net Neutrality repeal and what it means for ISPs/content.  __________________________________________________      **Music**  * [Dvořák’s “New World” Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HClX2s8A9IE) * [Fats Domino - Blue Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDO78-0a4ho) * [Sleigh Ride Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXXUXgaMtDY) * [Usher - Yeah! ft.

"Her funny but serious quote ""Fake news would tell you that we don't care for Jews,” Moore said, before claiming to “set the record straight.   “One of our attorneys is a Jew,” she said, pausing for laughs and hoots from the audience.

"Bannon needs to be focusing on All democrats. But mainly focus on those who we think we can flip from states trump won in 2016. Also we needs to focus on those who actively negatively attack Trump (flake, corker, Graham). Those who actively vote against Trump's agenda ( Susan Colins, McCain). Rather than going after like luther strange someone who like always votes with Trump. I would rather take someone who votes with Trump 90% of the time over someone who vote against Trump 100% of the time. We also need to be getting better turnout people need to go out and vote and hold theses seats and gain new ones."

"You know, I was thinking about something on my morning drive to work here in Alabama.  I am born and raised in Alabama and I absolutely love my state. I have been subjected to untrue stereotypes my entire life. A lot of it comes from places like reddit. There is nothing but hate towards my state, particularly by people from blue states. I find it incredibly ironic that the same people who scream ""Racists! Bigots! Homophobes! Inbreds! Rednecks! Uneducated!"" on reddit are the same people who want and expect me to vote for the candidate of their choice.   At the end of the day, even if i wanted to vote for that Democrap Doug Jones and even if the sky fell and that moron was elected, the very next day, reddit (outside of T_D) would continue the neverending circle jerk and call Alabamians every word in the book.   So to all of you libtards in reddit who constantly spew venom at my state:  You can promptly take your opinions and shove them directly up your ass. I'm voting Roy Moore in 30 minutes and there is no amount of hatred towards me and my state that you can spew to change it."
Does this guy give anyone else just a wrong uneasy feeling? He just oozes with sketchiness. Now there are reports that he was the mastermind behind protecting the hezbollah crime ring. There have been reports for years that he was a muslim convert. He needs to be investigated!

"On the American Side obviously. I was thinking that terrace the wall in populated places near the border and build buildings. Like vekta city in Killzone Shadowfall.

"Opened my app, clicked a post and somehow it went from celebrity clothing blunders to ""Trump is a child because he drank water with 2 hands.""

Give me a fucking break you idiotic pieces of shit."
"The things that used to be considered illegal,  in recent times have been completely vindicated by the Dems while MSM turns a blind eye.  Good to know!  Lets get to work Republicans.  Here are the NEW rules of politics. 1.)You can spy on your political opponent if they have ever made a phone call to a foreign country. 2.)You can use the IRS to target them. 3.)You can sign dead people/out of state people/and federal criminals to vote, while busing in PPL from out of state. 4.)You can pay foreign countries for dirt on Dems. 5.) You can create a fake scandal, hire a special counsel, and actually prosecute ppl for lying to such special counsel. 6.)You can drop billions in cash to terrorist country in the middle of the night with no approval from congress. 7.)You can lie to the FBI. 8.)You can destroy all evidence of phone records and emails and then lie to FBI.  9.) You can forge a year book signature, claim pedophilia, and flip a senate seat. 10.) You can murder your staffer if he starts to figure out voter fraud. 11.)Awan brothers? 12.) You can run guns to the mexican cartel, and when someone dies, its no big deal. 13.)You can destroy the healthcare system, and if someone questions it, say they are a bigot.  We just want to make sure we are all clear!  Everyone got the rules?  Now lets go get em! "
But it was on Trump's radar. And he didn't forget about it 3 years later. The man is single handedly saving America.
"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.    Every person deserves due process, even the democratic pedophiles."
"We need to fix this shit. Follow the president. Not Bannon, not McTurtle, not the rinos, not the RNC."
"If the IG Report is a dud or blames everything on strozk, will you still think a grand master plan is in the works sometime down the road?  Do you have a timeframe for indictments or is it open ended?  I have my days of frustration, like yesterday, where I start to worry that we’re being played. But I still believe the day of indictments is coming. But it’s not open ended. I think we should start to make our voices heard to our reps that we want action NOW. Enough is enough. We’re losing too much ground that each day passes without upholding the rule of law. "
"Shills trying to sway us, but they don't understand we can't be swayed. We are committed to MAGA! "

Hannity went all in on Trump. Beck went all in on Cruz and went a step further by being very anti-Trump. Beck's hatred of Trump killed his audience. I used to listen to him in the mornings on SiriusXM Patriot Radio. He isn't there anymore. I never see anyone linking to his website the Blaze anymore and his streaming TV channel has tumbled.  Kudos to him for not sitting on the fence. But he is paying dearly for going anti-Trump and isolating a lot of listeners.

"Private Investigator JORDAN HAMLETT, age 32, of Sunset, Louisiana, Illegally attempted to obtain the President's federal tax information pleads guilty and was convicted.  He faces up to five years in prison, fines and a supervised release following his imprisonment.    &gt;Department of Justice  &gt;U.S. Attorney’s Office  &gt;Middle District of Louisiana   &gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  &gt;**Monday, December 11, 2017**   &gt; *A Private Investigator Who Attempted to Illegally Obtain the President's Federal Tax Information Pleads Guilty Acting United States Attorney Corey Amundson announced today the conviction of a private investigator who fraudulently used President Donald J. Trump’s personal identifying information, including his social security number, in an attempt to illegally obtain his federal tax information from the Internal Revenue Service.*     &gt;On December 11, 2017, JORDAN HAMLETT, age 32, of Sunset, Louisiana, pled guilty to false representation of a social security number before U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles.  HAMLETT faces a five-year term of imprisonment, fines, and a term of supervised release following imprisonment.      &gt;During his guilty plea, HAMLETT admitted that on September 13, 2016, he used the President’s social security number to begin an online Free Application for Federal Student Aid (“FAFSA”).  After beginning the FAFSA, HAMLETT obtained a Federal Student Aid Identification, a combination of a username and password which allows students and parents to identify themselves electronically to access the FAFSA.  Once HAMLETT obtained the Federal Student Aid Identification, he unlawfully used the Internal Revenue Service’s Data Retrieval Tool in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the President’s federal tax information from IRS servers.  In connection with his attempt to obtain the President’s federal tax information, HAMLETT admitted that he knowingly and falsely declared that the President’s social security number was his own.     &gt;Acting U.S. Attorney Amundson stated, “My office, together with our federal, state, and local partners, will continue to aggressively pursue those engaged in the proliferation of identity theft and cybercrime, particularly when involving attempts to fraudulently obtain sensitive information from federal government databases.  I command TIGTA, DOE-OIG, FBI, and the assigned prosecutors for their outstanding collective efforts on this important matter.”     &gt;“The protection of confidential taxpayer information is among the most important responsibilities of the Internal Revenue Service and my agency,” said J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.  “TIGTA aggressively investigates attempts to illegally access Federal tax information.  Mr. Hamlett’s guilty plea should serve as a reminder to those who attempt to steal sensitive taxpayer information that they will be held accountable.  TIGTA would like to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their assistance with this successful prosecution.”     &gt;“I’m proud our staff and our law enforcement colleagues whose efforts brought about today’s actions,” said Robert Mancuso, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, Technology Crimes Division, the OIG unit that works to protect U.S. Department of Education programs and network infrastructure by investigating technology crimes.  “Mr. Hamlett’s guilty plea should serve as a warning to anyone who misuses the personally identifiable information of others to access protected computer systems for unlawful purposes: you will be caught and held accountable for your criminal actions.”     &gt;FBI New Orleans Field Office Special Agent-in-Charge Eric J. Rommal stated, “The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect our country’s information systems from exploitation and to investigate those who would seek to gain from doing so.”                  &gt;This matter is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Louisiana, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, Technology Crimes Division, with valuable assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Ryan Rezaei and Alan Stevens.     &gt;The U.S. Attorney’s Office—Cyber Security Initiative     &gt;United States v. Hamlett is being prosecuted as part of the USAO’s ongoing Cyber Security Initiative.  Begun in 2016, the Cyber Security Initiative brings together resources from various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, in an effort to investigate and prosecute cyber crime.  As a result of the initiative, the USAO has significantly increased the number of cyber investigations and prosecutions.  Earlier this year, in United States v. Johnson, the USAO secured a 34-month federal prison sentence for a former systems administrator who hacked into the computer system of a Georgia-Pacific plant located in Port Allen, Louisiana.     &gt;The USAO will continue to investigate and prosecute all those who commit cyber crime.  For more information about the USAO’s Cyber Security Initiative, please contact Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Rezaei at (225) 389-0443.

Then there’s T_D with 500k subscribed and 10k online.    Is it really that lopsided?   We have 2% online now, where most subs have more like .1% online.  Is that because most people here are only here, while other groups have people all over the site?   I know when I scroll down my feed that this group will have the most content.

"Warning,Long wall of text!  I need your prayers, 'pedes. My goal in this life is to help and inspire a thousand, if not a million, others to do great things by being the best person i can be, each and every day. That is my motto. I tell myself that every morning, and it goes with me wherever i do. I've raised my two sons on my own for the past 10 years, and work to teach them the values i've come to regard as necessary. I'm not perfect, and i've made PLENTY of mistakes along this journey. Right now, i'm dealing with the consequences of many of them.  I was in an abusive marriage for many years. I was a beta male cuck with no self worth. After 7 years and 2 awesome sons, she told me she wanted to be young and fun. Kids and a husband weren't part of her new equation. All i wanted was the boys. They are my love and my life. We're inseparable, and my life revolves around them.   I've had many chances to make a good life for them, but i barely manage to tread water. All i've ever been able to do is just make it until next payday. I have brought myself to the point where i needed to send my sons away with family, because i cannot financially provide for them. I quit my job to get a better one, but screwed up royally, and lost my new job. My old job would not take me back. I'm about to lose my apartment, and have nowhere to go. All i'm asking is to keep me in your prayers.   I know Christ is my Savior, and i will persevere and make this right. Right now, though, i feel weak, and i need your strength. This DOMreddit has been my stronghold as i brave the cucked world. You lads and ladies are the reason i have hope for humanity. I love you all, you wonderful deplorables!  "

This is just sad. Why can't people be happy to do something because it's the right thing to do? They helped take a serial killer off the streets for crying out loud! They should take that reward money and do something constructive with it. I don't know what but something.   http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/19/couple-who-provided-video-suspect-want-piece-reward.html

HE SAID I WOULD GET TIRED OF WINNING!!!! (I'M NOT)
"Some of this may be obvious but it's very simple overall.  This is about history more than anything.  No country on this earth has minded their own business and not paid the price for it.  People will attack you even if you're the most peaceful war-less nation on earth, to ultimately take what you have.    There will always be people out there that would love to have what someone else wants, and will take it if they can.  There are many examples of nations being attacked throughout history, for no other reason than to take what others have for themselves.  This is why the US, between WWI &amp; WWII, stopped being an isolationist nation.  There were incidences, such as the US was content to sit back and stay out of the fighting in WWI, it still was still active in commerce with European nations. But with the Germans propensity for attacking neutral cargo and passenger ships, including US ships...it made it difficult to sit idly by.      And sure, the US did exert some force against Japan between WWI &amp; WWII, first in concessions with Germany for Shantung, and later, more notably, the embargo against Japan that ultimately 'lead' to the US being attacked in Pearl Harbor.   But all of these were responses to things other countries had done, and the US was always attacked first.  I mean what could we really expect from the US.....innocent ships attacked in WWI, attacked without any real provocation in WWII.  And I haven't even touched the Revolutionary war against England.    There's a broad picture here that's easy to see.  The US didn't become what it was at any one moment, but it all gives insight into why the US is what it is, does what it does.  We don't make policy based on the facts of today, we make them based on facts of the past too.    Fast forward to the Korean war and all of that stuff.  We know what N. Korea is.  We know what they've done in the past.  They tried to take S. Korea once before, the US beat them back to the to the border with China, where China helped them and fought all the way back to where the borders are today.  That's the short story.    We know what N. Korea teaches its people, that the US are invading occupiers in the south, and the people in the south are essentially no different than prisoners.  N. Korea paints itself as a liberator.  We know by N. Korea's own propaganda and words, that their intentions are to retake the south.  And history shows us they tried before.    Now how N. Korea plans to do that, is up for grabs.  But the most likely way is to create conditions where the south willfully pushes the US based out of S. Korea, making it easy for N. Korea to move in.  N. Korea may have an outdated military, but 2 million soldiers with old weapons can do a lot of damage, capture a lot of land and entrench themselves deeply.  It's hard to bomb your enemies when they're occupying cities with your own people in them.  So S. Korea might create some lines and hold them, but they will likely lose a lot of land first, then slowly but surely lose more as N. Korean soldiers expand and entrench.  It would also be difficult for the US to join in, because again, it's hard to bomb your enemies when they're occupying civilian cities.  So N. Korea would take as much as they can as fast as they can before the US has a chance to respond.  Besides all of this, the biggest danger from N. Korea having nukes isn't that they'd use them, it's that if the state falls one day, nukes could end up for sale to the highest bidder, or stolen by terrorist states in the power vacuum in N. Korea's weakened state....and that's if N. Korea doesn't decide to sell them before then to countries like Iran or private entities.  The last thing we need are rogue nukes floating around, and all nukes are ticking time bombs until they are dismantled.  We simply can't allow any state to have nukes just because they want them.....who are we to say that you ask?  I don't know.....just the people that invented nukes.  I think that gives us some say so.   And on that note, the US has earned a lot of credibility when it comes to nukes.  Sure, it's the only country to ever nuke another country, but that saved more lives than it took, and it hasn't nuked anyone since either.  So the US has earned its place by showing its restraint.  After the atom bomb was invented, the US could have easily took over the whole world with little resistance if it wanted.  It didn't.  I think that buys the US some credit.    The US isn't a world power because it wanted to be, it became a world power because it did what it had to do, forced by the hands of foreign entities.  It's important to understand that to understand why the US has essentially become a world police force.    I would love for the US to be isolationist, but the world isn't that simple.  There will always be trade with someone, and that someone will always have an enemy, which by proxy makes you an enemy.  You could stop trade to appease others, but then you run the risk of making the person you stopped trading with an enemy.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't, not to mention you hurt yourself by stopping trade for a country that has nothing to offer you but threats.  Countries see that kind of fear, that kind of capitulance, and they will attack you out of seeing you as weak, eventually.  So there is no winning.  This is why the US has no choice but to exert its force and strength.   Just like how the US attacked Syria over the use of chemical weapons.  The Geneva convention, which bans chemical and biological weapons, and for good reason, is only a piece of paper if it's never upheld.  You allow violations to happen, and you erode the power of the document. You invite more people to violate it if there are no consequences.    This has obviously been more than about N. Korea, but it's all relevant.  N. Korea cannot be allowed to have nukes also because if they are, every dictator and hostile state that doesn't want to get attacked, will simply build nukes and have the threat of using them to get their way, to get leverage, to get concessions.  And then you have that problem of all these nuke potentially circulating.  The fact is, the more people in control of nukes, the more likely they will end up being used at some point by someone against someone.  Since you can only adequately respond to nuke attacks with more counter nuke attacks, that could set off a chain reaction of nuclear weapon usage across the globe.  Of course, that's assuming that the people nuked even have the capability of nuclear weapons, then it's just helpless people being slaughter.    But imagine the can of worms it would open if N. Korea fell, and some of its nukes ended up in foreign hostile actors hands, then detonated on US soil. We might not even know who is ultimately responsible to respond, we will have simply been nuked with no target to fight back against.  But do we nuke N. Korea in return, even though they were technically innocent of it?  What if their government is friendly and in new leadership at that point?  Will a simple ""sorry"" do?  Not really.  That would be a tough cookie to swallow.  That would anger a lot of people, there will be calls of ""We could have prevented this if only we were tougher on N. Korea!"", and they'd be right.  And that's exactly the type of stuff this is all trying to prevent.    "

"Evening fellow Muricans... let me begin by celebrating and welcoming all races, religions, beliefs, genders, bias and non-biased opinion. I feel like we've got something special here. Real special. A rare thing these days, with real people banding together for a real cause.   * We are not hateful. We want the best for **everyone** and every country.  * We are not stupid. We simply try to **pay very close attention to** current events from **a multitude of sources and** draw the most logical conclusions.  * We are not deplorable. Pedes just wanna **have fun.**  Anyhow, The_Donald is not an enemy of the people. If things were as bad as they are portrayed, wouldn't you feel or see something different? Do you really see or feel any actual, real life, changes to your day to day?  I hear it all of the time. If not directly, then indirectly, in casual conversations about how terrible Trump is. But very little reason is ever provided to back that statement up.   And in the media, if you actually look for the bias? **You can't stop.** And this is true on both sides, Fox (recently acquired by Disney... no worry there) / Breitbart / DailyCaller included . Take this as an example:  &gt;""What's more, he's gone beyond the Hallmark-lite sentiments of 'Not Afraid' towards something actually meaningful, taking on white detachment and comfort in society and the figurehead of our ills, Trump.  &gt;His good intentions just make how genuinely excruciating this record is all the more sad.""  This was from a review of the new Eminem album on thefourohfive.com.  What the fuck? ""Good intentions""? ""The figurehead of our ills, Trump""?   This kind of nonsense is perpetual. Equating Trump to literally everything that is bad. Really?... that just seems like such a ridiculous thing to say about the President. If it happened once in awhile, that's fine. But it has become the new ""How's the weather?"".   The brainwashing is strong. Resist it. You are all better than that. On both sides.         "

"My Recommendation to Sarah H. Sanders:  Sarah Sanders: From now on we will have rules of conduct for those attending this briefing.  1- Only questions on the topic of the day will be allowed and once that question is answered no one will be allowed to ask the same question. I am not going to have a press briefing where all I am doing is answering the same question over and over. It's not going to happen!  2- We expect you to behave like mature adults and not like children. Act like the ladies and gentlemen you are supposed to be, even if it just an acting job.  3- Any disrespectful or obnoxious behavior will no longer be tolerated!  4- Our enforcement officer near me will ensure that this meeting is orderly and that no one abuses the privilege of being here. He has been instructed to escort out anyone who is belligerent or in any way disturbs the decorum in this room.  5- Any person who has to be escorted out will not be allowed to return for a period of 3-months. If after 3-months they return and behave the same rude way, they will be barred from all White House events and press sessions for life.  6- Journalist who spins and misleads the public with false statements or malicious reporting aimed at ""getting even with our President"" for pointing out their lies and obfuscations, will be reprimanded and after 3 incidents will be barred for a period of 3-months. If after 3-months they return and violate our trust and the trust of the public again, he or she will be barred from all our affairs forever.  And so, an alternative or foreign press network will replace those whose reporters have been barred.  One way or another, we will make sure that true news instead of the fake news is reaching Americans and the world  7- The mass media corporations that allow false erroneous reporting over and over will be held accountable. Our Justice Department will investigate to see if they are agents of Russia or any other foreign entity. We will not allow mass propaganda and indoctrination of values and beliefs that are contrary to the American Way. We are championing the rights of ""We The People"" who elected us to protect them and make America Great Again. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MJoDOIF.jpg)  "

So I'm staying in D.C. for the night at a hotel and the ONLY channel that won't work is fox News. Probably just a coincidence but I thought I should share.
" Democrats have criticized the GOP tax plan on the grounds of the ""small"" amount of the tax cut for middle class workers. The example I saw was for someone with a $41,000 salary, the tax cut would be $1,350. But keep in mind that's for a $41,000 gross pay. The take home pay after all federal, state, local, and social security taxes are taken out might only be $30,000, in which case the reduction in federal taxes would be like getting a 4.5% raise.   But to make the reality of the tax cut even more apparent, I favor giving tax payers the option to have all of it be given on their tax refund. As it is now, tax payers will see a reduction in their withholding, so an increase in their take-home pay, starting February next year. But their tax refunds are based on 2017 taxes, so they won't see an increase in their tax refunds they receive in 2018.   One complaint made against the tax plan is it reduces the deductions you can take for real estate taxes on your home. For many middle class home owners their yearly property tax is a significant burden. Indeed many use their tax refunds to pay their real estate taxes. Then with this new tax plan giving them all at once an additional, say, $1,350, it would appear as a windfall.   So the suggestion here is for tax payers to have the option of having the same withholding as before, no reduction in withholding compared to previous years, but all the reduction in taxes appearing as an *all at once increase* in their tax refund.  Congress can certainly pass a law to do this. But note this increased tax refund would only appear in their 2019 refunds. I want to go further to have tax payers get this increase in their tax refunds also in 2018.  This would be a more controversial change. For what it means is making the tax cut retroactive to the 2017 taxes. Congress can also do this but there hasn't been much support for this because it would increase the budget deficit. However, opponents of the tax plan are continuing to make the argument that the tax cuts aren't real or relevant to low and middle income earners. But with that one step of increasing the tax refund also in 2018 this would go a long way to showing to most Americans how significant that tax cut is.   See this article for the discussion of the lack of support of making the tax cut retroactive to 2017:  Ariz. lawmaker asks for tax cuts be retroactive to 2017.

"Ok fellow pedes:  The first time I heard DJT talk about defaulting was on a CNBC interview in May 2016: https://www.cnbc.com/video/3000515737  After realizing that he almost gave up his grand plan, he quickly retracted with normal wall street/financial speak for which he even went on CNN (showing his mastery trolling skills): http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/05/09/donald-trump-debt-newday.cnn/video/playlists/donald-trump/   He warned that with the FED raising interest rates and continued unfunded spending, the debt would become unsustainable.   To keep up, we will have to print even more money. As The_Donald and all based patriots understand, this will lead to inflation of our monetary supply and loss of wealth and investment insecurity, leading to real economic collapse.  Superficially, there are 2 ways to lower the debt/GDP ratio: 1. Increase tax revenue  --&gt; not happening. The only people with any taxable capital are rich people, no way they will be taxed unless Bernie Sanders were President, in which case those guys would flee the country, i.e. no tax revenue at all. 2. Lower spending --&gt; not happening. Neither Republicans, nor Dems will ever again lower spending.  3. Goldmanite plan/Trump's Ruse: Increase the tax revenue through increased money velocity.  With economic growth reaching 3% in consecutive quarters, it seems to be off to a decent start. This is DJTs Ruse or ""fake plan"".  Unfortunately, after 10 years of bull markets and bubbles galore, Trump knows that this won't last (as he said during his campaign time and time again). There are a few more ideas of stimulating growth and revenue, ie. bringing in several million people and make them all work and be tax-revenue contributing citizens. ... but let's not get lost in such hypotheticals.  So if this is the ""fake DJT plan"", what other trump cards does DJT have up his sleeve?  4. Trump card:  That's where the default comes in. We will have the economy white dazzling hot for a couple quarters before the insane military spending and infrastructure spending, loss of tax revenue completely blow out the treasury, quickly ratcheting up to 30 trillion within 2 years.  At this point Trump will reveal a secret dossier showing his real plan which dates back to before the election. The restructuring of our debt and currency reset will be the bitter needed medicine the US has to take. And because Trump has put the US into a nice and pleasant economic hype, it will be a relatively ""steady"" endeavor for Americans. Fortunately, the based American people have shown that they want to hear the truth and take their medicine.   It is then that we will realize his real power and love for the American people. For if he fails, he will be the ultimate selfless martyr.  In short:  DJT will pull the plug on the phony system before his first term ends and bring us a currency and debt reset, setting us either up for a new era of wealth and prosperity, or, in case America fails to support him and see the light, sacrifice himself for truth and the American people."

"but I gained a little respect for him when he said Congress should ""move on"" from the whole Trump sexual assault allegations, and said he does not believe Trump should resign over them.

"But have you noticed that the only people who are verbally against President Trump are losers that failed at life? These are the types of people that I noticed who seem to hate Trump:  Adults who went to college and never did anything with their diploma because of unrealistic expectations. Drugs addicts who fail to recognize their addiction or seek help. Single parents who were wild and then blame society for unsustainable life decisions instead taking responsibility for their poor judgment and decision making. Lazy under achievers who mooch off everyone and blame society for their poverty situation and expect someone else to rescue them. Immature adults who are self absorbed and too afraid to think outside the norm and shame anyone who thinks differently than them. People who are horrible with managing their money and spend every single dime and refuse to save any. People who are afraid of learning that their world doesn't function like they have been told it does and refuse to listen to anyone trying to tell them otherwise. People who are without a doubt stupid but go about their life like they are scholars even though they have devoted zero time into studying a field and only have a phone full of ""woke"" memes and articles with no reference to any sources.  To me what really makes it worse is that they think they are being some kind of badass rebel instead of admitting what they are in reality, losers. Failures. Waste of space, money, and time. I know I may sound full of myself but next time you hear someone say that they hate Trump, ask yourself if they fall into anyone of those categories I mentioned above and you too will start to see a pattern develop."

"Liberals have a firm grasp on social media, and it’s evident on reddit. On the popular posts subreddit, loads of BS liberal propaganda is being blasted in the faces of millions. r/The_Donald is hated by liberals because we are a minority on the internet. The internet wants to make people like us feel insignificant, and that we are the crazy ones. The thing is, Trump was voted in by the majority; he won. The liberals lost, but they don’t want to lose their control of the internet.   I suggest we demonstrate to the liberals that their ideas cannot dominate Reddit, and this can be accomplished by making their ideas on Reddit less significant. If all users came together by commenting and down voting on popular liberal Reddit posts that appear on the Reddit trending. We must show that we are the MAJORITY. We cannot let the people sitting on the fence, between left and right, be taken by liberalism, because they aren’t given another opinion to reason with.   The liberals want those people to blindly follow them, because they have deceived them in believing they are the right majority, and we are the radical minority. Which in reality is Vice Versa.   This may not be the best approach to this situation, and it is subject to change, but I want to spread the word about this subreddit, and let’s demonstrate that we have common sense, not them.   I am open to suggestions on how this can be accomplished. Great minds think alike. Let’s show Reddit that we can be heard too!   Remember: Downvote and Comment against liberalism! "

"I have worked in luxury, commission, retail long enough to remember the housing market crash, the .com crash and a few in between. I have been waiting and waiting, Since the market bottomed for a turnaround. The stock market recovered, and Obama used that to tell us that the economy was better. I work in a business that is dependent on people having money and i can tell you first hand, they do not. I have been watching paint dry on tumbleweeds rolling past a blank sky for months now.   On Tuesday night we were handed a gift by that wonderful man, Mr Donald J Trump. He cut taxes. That's all it took. Three simple words and it was done. He. Cut. Taxes.  I tried warning my coworkers. They refuse to remember. They are so blind to the world beyond 'trumprussiadeathtransgender' that at worst they say ""you're crazy"" and at best they say ""i hope so"". Even though they have seen three market crashes before, each time with the economy roaring back better than before every time.  They focus on buzzwords like ""trickle down"" and ""the 1%"". If they spent half as much time learning as they do telling me what they know, they'd at least understand their paychecks rising. I show them the tax plan calculator and they call it fake news, even when its from CNN. I try explaining that its not trickling; the faucet was opened. It's not the 1%; its the 85%.  The good news is they will still benefit, whether they want to or not. I will be glad to see everyone prosper, no matter why they think they are getting rich. On January 12, 2018, every single working american will have gotten their first paycheck of the year and 85% of them will not only realize they have been lied to but they suddenly have a couple extra dollars in their pocket. That's it friends, January 12 is the last day you have to prepare for the opposite-apocolypse that will be known as the Trump Legacy.  We have been told retail is dead and amazon has taken over but i will tell you that if you let people have more of their money they will go out and spend it, not hide behind a screen and click buy. Do any of you remember calling your friends to ""go shopping""? I bet you didn't until i mentioned it, but now you do. My fellow patriots we have waited for this day, and It is here.  For the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country.   "

Just look at an comments section on any thread here and you will see diverse opinions on most topics. Rather than getting shouted down people are listened to and meaningful discussion often takes place. Donald Trump has attracted support from an enormous spectrum of unique individuals and we have created a place here where the truth stands on it's own merit and the BS is politely picked apart. I've changed quite a few of my opinions here based off what I have learned. Thank you.

However, the CEO returned his guaranteed $2mil bonus (awesome guy) and everyone in the company got a ~2.5% raise for 2018, which came out AFTER the tax plan.  Thanks to President Trump and my CEO, I'll be earning more and keeping more!   SPEZ: As of writing this, no one has died yet due to tax cuts and the generosity of our CEO."

"I 100, no, 1000% believe deep down in my heart that Dr. GEOTUS Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States is responsible for making Christmas great again. We haven't had snow on Christmas in upstate New York since about 2009, tonight into tomorrow we are getting about 8 inches, or two terms worth of snow. I find it incredibly ironic that we have had a president who has pushed climate change on us for 8 years, and the one guy who ""doesn't believe"" (according to the left) in climate change is now the president. I find it even more ironic that the culture of the US has been leaning toward ""happy holidays"" for the past 8 years, and the first year we have a grown up in the White House, people are saying Merry Christmas again, and boom, snow. The spirit is back, people are believing again, Christmas is great again. I want to wish all of you beautiful deplorables a very Merry Christmas! Love your family, love your friends, drain the swamps of your own lives and be happy. Don't forget to wish love and happiness on those who don't love you back. Let's make Christmas and America Great Again!!!"

The setup is well underway.

"'Twas the night before Christmas, Assange's Twitter deleted   It appears to prevent us from seeing what we needed;   The teasers had been dropped, Seth Rich's name was in there,   The Deep State must be terrified of what he would share;  spez: Wow, it appears I've found the perfect trigger words to get downvoted!"

"There has been a lot to like over the last year.  The thing I like most about the past year is Trump's streamlining of the office of President and the Executive Branch, pushing power back to the people and Congress.  He's the first President in my life - maybe ever - who has spent his time in office *reducing* the power of the Presidency - in a great way.  Why do I say this?  In all of these areas, I'm not commenting on my preferred outcome of the legislation or lack thereof.  I'm commenting on the process.  I LOVE the move AWAY from executive actions masquerading as legislation.  First, there was Sessions' appointment.  Sessions said he would enforce federal marijuana laws, as the executive branch is supposed to do.  He effectively said, ""If the people want to loosen marijuana laws, then Congress should loosen marijuana laws.  This isn't for the executive branch to decide.""  Again, no matter your views on marijuana, it's being tossed back to Congress and the people.  Then there was DACA.  The ""DA"" in DACA is ""Deferred Action.""  Obama said the executive branch was ""deferring action"" on enforcing federal laws.  Deferring until when?  Based on the response from Democrats, it is clear that the intention was to defer for forever.  Why didn't Obama just defer for forever?  Because that would effectively be legislation, which should be handled by Congress.  DACA was an end-around the legislation process.  Trump effectively said, ""If Congress and the people want to change the law on these people, then they should change the law.  I'm not going to make up my own laws that go against federal law.""  Then there was the ending of TPS for Haitian immigrants.  In 2010, Obama granted *temporary* (18 month) legal status to otherwise illegal Haitian immigrants.  He did it so as not to send Haitians back to their hurricane-devastated country.  18 month legal status that had been extended for 8 years and was acting as de facto legislation from the executive branch.  Once again, Trump effectively said, ""If Congress and the people want to legalize them, they should legalize them.  It's not for the Executive Branch to be making up its own legislation.""  And finally, we had the Jerusalem decision.  A Democratic-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate voted, in 1995, to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  This legislation was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton.  Enacting this legislation had been deferred *every six months* for the past 22 years.  Clinton kicked it to Bush.  Bush kicked the can down the road 16 times and pushed it on Obama's plate... who kicked the can down the road 16 times and pushed it to Trump's plate.  And Trump ended it.  Everyone has an opinion on the outcome of all of these.  I have my opinion on outcomes.  But no matter what happens, I prefer that the decision be made by Congress, via the people.  Trump has consistently ended these executive actions masquerading as legislation.  He's shown his great power by actually ceding improper power that former White Houses were wielding.  He might be the first President to have ever done this.  The businessman we were promised!"
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! or is it pre recorded - MOTHER FUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
...and time to get on the KEEP AMERICA GREAT train.   
"This solves so many issues.  Challenged to slander/libel? Defend your honor with a pistol.  Lefties BTFO.  You can, of course, concede the duel by paying a massive fine for admitting you committed slander, or proving that your statement is true.  Hence, preventing ""silencing the media through violence.""  Literally put up or shut up.  Gang shootings? Become non-existent. They become orchestrated, legal events, in controlled zones.  No more drive-bys hitting bystanders.  The two parties meet, decide upon an agreed upon location, and duel it out like men instead of afghani tribals in a concrete jungle.  Y'know, just like in Gangs of New York and the battle of the Crossroads.  spez: Side benefit for benefit for Democrats: All sanctioned duels will no longer be applied to gun crime statistics.  Cities will quickly fall in line with the rest of the country in terms of recorded gun crimes.  Spez II:  Choices are as follows:  - Admit you committed slander, pay fine - Provide proof of your statement (receive compensation, I guess?) No duel/fine required - Do not provide proof of your statement, reiterate original statement, partake in duel   **** Lets reintroduce an actual code of honor to our society.  Thoughts?"

"is that he didn't run, and win, in 2000. Maybe we wouldn't have the current shitshow in the Middle East that the Bush neocons created. Maybe 9/11 would have been stopped as well.      Oh well, Merry Christmas y'all. Better late than never."
"Speaking of Trump vs the Decepticons  ""He’s one guy, and he has them entirely surrounded""  Too funny"
"I was fully expecting a full on assault on GEOTUS but nope. I am shocked. Are people slowly coming to their senses? Only 8 replies atm so the sentiment could change but I was happy to see rational posing. Seems that nobody believe this made up fake shit (well, except for the media)."
"Even though this past year's been really bad for you guys, we still have 7 more ahead for you to de-cuck and help MAGA. Let's all stop being little faggots and support our awesome president."
Does anyone know what his email is? I want to voice my concern about McCabe getting a pension with all the legal questions surrounding his job performance.

Really.... because Padopolis pulled his shit back in August. Meanwhile the Steele Dossier and Don Jr meeting setup happened in April. Furthermore it was August when Strozk made the insurance policy comment. Therefore the probe was started because of the Dossier.
"I know 2017 hasn't been the best for you, but that's no reason to give up hope (remember hope?), and trying to make the future brighter. So, in the coming months instead of selfishly spending all that extra money brought to you by big mean Trump's economy, why don't you start now and give to the Hillary in 2020 Campaign! "

"First of all, we all knew that Flynn was going to be indicted awhile ago. The timing of this was all just a big FU to try and influence the Senate Tax Vote today. It's a very dirty trick and one of two things might happen: 1, Senate will decide to delay the vote because of this or 2, it will scare everyone into voting no.  Like everyone else with a brain, I don't think Russia did anything that would have hindered the election. Seriously, this is all sounding like a bad Tom Clancy novel (And I like those btw). That Trump is some kind of Hidden USSR Spy trying to destroy America. It's all bullcrap and we all know this investigation is for show. Chances are it's going to go for four years.   Everyone thought Manafort was going to get indicted and turn on Trump and  impeach. What happened with that? Nothing. It's the same old song and dance with Flynn. He's being indicted for lying to the FBI. The same lie that got him fired in the first place with Pence and Trump. The news thinks he's going to turn on Trump and expose his secret evil lair where he talks with Great Leader Putin and how he strokes his evil white cat while putting for Mexicans in a shark tank with lasers on top of their heads while laughing.   There is no proof. There is no evidence. And how would Flynn even know when he was only part of the House for a short time? Especially since he's an Obama person. This is going to be a big fat nothingburger like its always been, but the media is going to use this to say ""TRUMP IS DONE! REELECTION! HILLARY ELECTED!"" or what not.   All in all, this is only going to get the Leftards all happy and joy celebrating before they realize ""Well, we'll get him next time! I'm sure of it!"" and all that.   So I'm not worried. Until Donald Trump actually is facing impeachment or being lead in handcuffs from the white house I would ignore any panic.   And if Flynn does lie? I'm sure Donald Trump has a back up plan that will expose all of this as a big lie. "
"This is a working conspiracy theory--but a good one.  Evidence based on end results.  It's probably real if you pay attention to the observations and consequences.  If you don't like speculation, please stop reading and ignore this post with no penalty to the post.  One thing is for certain, and it's that part of this idea is proven and real.  The spy ring in Congress.  Let's look at *cui bono*, Q: who benefits from the fake news fakeout of the latest correction to the timeline of ""Flynn told to contact Russia AFTER Trump was elected""?  A: Well anyone short selling index, the dow and s&amp;p500, or having a funds that mimic the same (say top 25-100 stocks).  Anyone making out big time over the last year MAY WELL BE the people who have a very financial incentive to dessiminate fakenews and then desseminating that news' corrections, retrations, redactions, etc.    &gt; This is called *'front running' on intelligence*.  Q: Who has intelligence?  A: Not the public.  Not any of us.  All we have to work with is news media, which has proven itself to be fake news--actual misinformation, disinformation and malinformation, as well as citizen open source journalism (low-informed person: ""conthpirathy theoriees!"").  Intelligence agencies have so-called intelligence. We don't. I'm not making a *double-entendre* play here.  By intelligence, I mean **they know things we can't know, because of their inexplicable, sanctioned secrecy**, but also because *they are working--illegally or otherwise--to bring about the changes in the world--using our tax money and often against our consent, judgments, will, or interests--that only* ***they will know about, ahead of time***.   &gt; If you stage an event, then DUH, of course you will know about said event. Normally this is called *'conspiracy'*--people working in secret to bring about things that the are otherwise considered unlawful if non-sanctioned peoples did the same.  If you want to understand this concept of front-running on intelligence is, watch this episode of Max Keiser Report, [NSA-spreads Ditigal AIDS](https://youtu.be/3aJN4hjhALY?t=322), and there is another couple of episodes where Kaiser and Hubert discuss how the intelligence community makes ALL businesses vulnerable to IP theft, but that's a similar but different story.  I mention this because...what if I told you that Hillary Clinton and Obama are CIA--and they were using Pakistani ISI hackers to create an off-brand CIA within the Congress that used a secure, mobile, private, wireless, highly compartmentalized communications network, using Pakistani-doped Blackberries to essentially spirit out US intelligence to other countries, which then allowed foreign agents to *front-run on intelligence* in exchange for political donations; and the way that you keep your Congresspeople who are in on this scam are being blackmailed by their own perversions, crimes, and participation in these same *quid pro quos*, ...  ....and that the Mainstream Media--being effectively managed by Obama, Soros and the 7th floor groups (Team Clinton Foundation) deepstate agents throughout the government as a fifth-column--is complicit in this crime syndicate and scheme...and that Donald Trump was an unexpected CIA white hat's black swan event--or I should say dark horse event--and now he's an absolute existential threat to this scheme being exposed.  Well, now the Donald knows.  Everyone else in reddit, facebook, twitter is gobbling on about the social justice illusions that are spun daily as distraction.  But the Awan train has left the station and the Truth train has no brakes. Tick Tock.  --- reposted from textpost shadowbanned 911bodysnatchers322 account"

"I need help...I have an attorney for a neighbor (a very liberal attorney) and he has taken to trying to sue my husband and I for every.little.thing. He is near retirement and bored, so we get the brunt of it. Yipee.   The main problem I have is we both share a driveway. We both need the driveway to access main roads. There are no other options for us to build a driveway, or for him. His house is about 40% of the way down the drive, mine is all the way at the end.   I own a home daycare. It annoys him. He can't see my home or hear the kids, he's too far away - 3 or 4 highly wooded acres. I have 4 parents dropping off and picking up every day. This really ticks my neighbor off.   Ironically, he runs a law firm from his home...with 2 employees and clients coming and going. Legal papers being dropped off by DSL or FedEx all the time. So as much if not more traffic than me.   He's taking me to circuit court to shut down my legal business and has taken steps to try to hide his. Mother pucker even took his attorney license off the state bar, but he wife still has hers up. He doesn't know that I know she's an attorney. We've only officially talked 2 times in 4 years. That's right - he prefers to talk via legal paperwork. Very threatening legal paperwork.   I am DONE with this harassment. I am not about to spend 10K on a lawyer, which is what I'm sure he wants. He takes pics of us, videos, has pulled up our property stakes and scoped out our pole barn multiple times, looking for ""non-personal, commercial activities"". I'm about to lose my head here.   I've been kind, and I'm done with that now. Time to give him a taste of what having a bad neighbor is like. Here is what I need help with. At our last property assessment, we found out we own 300 feet of his backyard. And we own everything behind that, as well. Everything he can see, we own, minus his few feet of backyard. I need ideas of the best ways to wreck his views that won't cost a fortune. I'd like to start with the 300 feet of his backyard.   Help a fellow Pede out here. There are probably better places to post, but you guys are more like family. "

"1) Trump had 2 scoops of ice cream.  2) The media lied about Trump feeding the Koi Fish.  3) The media went after Trump when he was eating a steak.  4) Lying about the Dossier.  5) Talked about Russian collusion with Scarramucci (3 reporters resigned).  6) Lying about Flynn being told by Donald to contact Flynn during the campaign (When he was the PRESIDENT-ELECT) (Bob ross got suspended)  7) CNN lying about the date when Wikileaks gave Trump Jr. an ""Encrypted"" key.  There's probably more that I haven't added, but feel free to include it.  We should make a more organized list of this."

"Republicans in Blue states like mine showed zero support for the MAGA agenda.  None supported the President's push to repeal Obamacare.  None have been vocal in the press.  None even came out and said ""The people elected this man for a reason.  We must support his agenda"".  How can we be surprised that the President showed no inclination to do us any favors?  he knows there is no support in the Senate from these states, and the support in the house doesn't do him any good either.  If I were Trump and a congressman didnt support the Obamacare repeal, I wouldn't be interested in talking to him about how the SaLT deductions affect his state.        The lesson here is clear:  support the President and he'll support you.  Oppose him at your own peril.  So what is the likely result? many of us will want to move to tax friendly states... which is good for the President."

"Don't fret fellow pede's. Looks like Flynn could have been a plant by the clinton campaign and the original mole. He was/is a registered democrat and could have been pretending and faking his enthusiasm about Trump in order to get close to him. (Manafort similar, looks like he's been working for Poedesta group for a long time)  People who called out Donald Trump about sexual harassment are now being outed left and right, the Trump curse is upon them! The dems are trying to use this as a distraction and telling the media to focus mostly on that rather than the Tax bill.  I also find it strange that the jury and judge came so quickly to this decision. Smells funky to me. We all know that the justice system is corrupt and full of bribery. DoJ, lead by Jeff Sessions, is considering filing federal charges against the MURDERER of Kate Steinle and would probably have better success outside of the corrupt area of San FranSICKsco."

"https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/12/21/oh-dear-trail-of-russian-dossier-origination-now-directly-leads-to-the-obama-white-house/  Several new developments happening today center around the FBI’s use of the Christopher Steele Dossier in gaining FISA warrants to wiretap and monitor the 2016 campaign of Donald Trump; ie. “The Trump Project”. Doug Ross continues to update the ongoing conspiracy Timeline – http://directorblue.blogspot.tw/2017/12/a-timeline-of-treason-how-fbi.html  Before going to the White House visitor angle, it’s important to express appreciation for Tablet Mag who did a deep dive into the Fusion-GPS connection to the creation of the Steele Dossier, and more specifically how Fusion-GPS head Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the White House prior to the DOJ and FBI applying for the FISA warrant – SEE HERE. http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/251897/obama-steele-dossier-russiagate  The Tablet-Mag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished Steele Dossier entering into the White House and how President Obama likely saw and reviewed the content.  However, missing from the this report is an origination angle even more nefarious.  Remember, previous media reporting -in conjunction with Clinton campaign admissions- have confirmed the DNC and Clinton Campaign financed Fusion-GPS through their lawyers within Perkins Coie.   Fusion then sub-contracted with retired British MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write the dossier.  The dates here are important because they tell a story.  The origin of the Clinton effort with Fusion-GPS was April 2016.  That’s the same month Fusion hired Nellie Ohr, wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr, to gather opposition research on candidate Trump.  It would be most likely that Nellie Ohr was in contact with Christopher Steele.  DOJ Deputy Attorney Bruce Ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with Christopher Steele and Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson.  However, there was another event in this April 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the Dossier origination.  https://twitter.com/GOPPollAnalyst/status/944012049767682049  n April 2016 Mary Jacoby shows up on White House visitor logs meeting with President Obama officials. In April 2016 the Clinton Campaign and DNC hired Fusion-GPS to organize the Russia research, that later became known as the “Steele Dossier”.  The wife of Glenn Simpson (Fusion GPS), Mary B. Jacoby, with years of Russia-angled reporting –including Donald Trump– visits the White House in April 2016, at the same time as the DNC and Clinton hire Fusion GPS to conduct the opposition research on Donald Trump, surrounding Russia?  This timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidental.  Expand slightly and consider:  April: Mary Jacoby, wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, visits the White House.  The Clinton Campaign and DNC then hire Fusion GPS to conduct ‘Opposition Research’, with a Russian emphasis.  Fusion GPS then hires Nellie Ohr who specializes in Russian-centric counterintelligence.  Nellie Ohr then contacts MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write a Russian Dossier.  A month later, May 2016: Nellie Ohr’s husband inside the DOJ, Bruce Ohr, is then working with FBI counterintelligence head Peter Strzok.  By June 2016: Peter Strzok, Bruce Ohr and DOJ Attorney Lisa Page then apply for a FISA warrant.  June 24th, 2017, Mary Jacoby appears on Facebook taking credit for the origination of the Russiagate narrative.  This timeline is so transparent it’s deafening.      [More from the Tablet] Simpson and Jacoby had ID’d Manafort as a world-class sleazeball and they were right. A slick Georgetown Law grad running in GOP circles since the Reagan campaign, Manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people. I would only add here that, in my personal experience, journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they’ve written, especially stories with a character like Manafort at the center.      So when the Trump campaign named Paul Manafort as its campaign convention manager on March 28, 2016, you can bet that Simpson and Jacoby’s eyes lit up. And as it happened, at the exact same time that Trump hired Manafort, Fusion GPS was in negotiations with Perkins Coie, the law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the Trump campaign they had started for the Washington Free Beacon. (more)  If the counterintelligence FISA warrant was obtained through deception, misleading/manipulated information, or fraud; and that warrant is what led to the wiretapping and surveillance of candidate Donald Trump and General Flynn; and that warrant was authorized by FISA Court Judge Contreras –who was the judge in Flynn’s case, and is now recused– the entire tenuous FBI and DOJ operation begins to collapse and the outline of a “conspiracy” becomes clearly evident.  The back-story to the FISA warrant is the cornerstone. The back-story contains both the FBI and the DOJ scheme. Expose it, remove it, and the entire ‘muh Russia’ conspiracy fraud collapses under the weight of sunlight.     "

"What did Russian do to help Trump win, really. This was an open election and everyone was watching! Besides, if there was a magic word that Trump could say to Putin to make himself win, Hillary probably would have said it first.   "

"I suspect this has been worked out between Trump and Netanyahu/Israel's higher-ups, and that this is why Trump made his announcement about Jerusalem.  If the Israelis offer the ""Palestinians"" the land they are demanding, and yet they still refuse (like Arafat back in 2000, when the offer included almost everything they were asking for,) then it's pretty clear who's full of shit.

"I am a fan of Crowder. And he is right on almost everything in this video. But... One thing that Crowder didn't explain well is why uninsured people pay 4x as much. Because the truth is... If an uninsured and insured person get the same procedure (non-ER) then the result is that the uninsured person does pay 4x because only insured patients get discounts because their insurance company has made a contract with each hospital to get the fair price.

"I can't tell you how much crap I have received for being an outward supporter of our President Trump. I've lost friends, I've been labeled a racist, etc. I'll tell you this, millennials have to be the most brainwashed generation in modern times. Very few have their OWN real opinions and views. They go on their social media and eat up whatever they are seeing. They want to be ""hip"" and ""cool"" so bad that they have completely sacrificed any originality they had to begin with. It's a disease and I won't let it take my mind. I will continue to fight the good fight and never give in to the media's tactics. Thank God for Generation Z. I worked at a camp over the summer when I was back in town from college and these kids are so based! They see right through the lies and it's beautiful. Won't be too long until these kids grow and enlist into The_Donald army. Well pedes, I'm signing off. I want all of you to know that every single one of you has a major part in this fight and I know it may not seem like it sometimes but we are winning big. "

Based on all this crap this week I'm convinced reddit has doxed us all to the deep state Democrat police force known as the FBI.
So according to Google it states that PRESIDENT TRUMP received over 62 Million Votes in the 2016 Presidential.Election. If every one of those Trump voters donated $240 each that would be over $15 Billion Dollars to pay for the wall. I'm all for Mexico paying for the wall however seems like that's going to take awhile at least with our congress. Is there anything stating that the AMERICAN people that wish to could help pay for the wall through private donations ? I understand that some people may not wish to or may not be able to afford $250 dollars but I'm sure there are other people could donate more. I would gladly donate more.  Just a though!  Anyone have a thought on this?
Flynn was fired for lying. Trump and Mueller agree that Flynn is not honest.

Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:  **FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**  &gt;Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651  **Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**  &gt;Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508  **b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**  &gt;The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the “disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”503  **Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**  &gt;Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518  **UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **  &gt;If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.  **Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**  &gt;We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved “laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...""  **And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**  &gt;176.We also reject AT&amp;T’s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&amp;T explains that “conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‘common carrier’ classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],”648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.  #TL;DR  *    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.  *    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government ""extravagant statutory power over the national economy"".   *    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.  *    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).  *    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.  *    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.  *    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.  *    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.  *    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  **Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? Allegedly this FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.  Trump's admin is trying to fight for your privacy.**"

"More and more power is going to fewer and fewer people further and further away where they are protected by more and more security with bigger and bigger guns, more and more cameras and more and more access to your information, and behind larger and larger international organizations that are redtaped by more and more levels of unelected bureaucratic appointees.  Retrieve power from the global, corporate, and political class, deny their MSM propaganda, and return power to the local. End the competition for global power run by either political “side” who share more common political interest in attaining power over the people than any interests they share with the rights of the individual. Deny power to globalists, whether corporatist in nature, socialist in nature, etc. Give power back to the local, against any reason it is denied to them.  From the context of the individual comes their rights. From the context of the collective, the context of conformism and the struggle for power, the individual is a brick in the wall of a statistic, the individual is forgotten without mention, let alone any concession to their rights.  But what are the questions that need to be asked?  &gt; How do we stop Third-wave feminism from destroying Western Civilization?  [Liberalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/77axcl/liberalism/). Western civilization is based on liberal philosophy: individualism, the right to self determination, and a value for empiricism and objectivity. It has has a rocky time, especially getting started, because traditionalism and theocratic ideas have competed with it (and even overpowered it, even from the very beginning, ex: slavery), along with insidiously violent profiteers and the German philosophies (of which feminism is one). We are a nation that invented constitutional human rights, inspired by the natural rights revealed by liberal philosophy (the right to self determination). Thanks to the efforts of liberals througout the years (and some happy accidents, like ending slavery), we’ve created perhaps the most indiscriminate system of any nation even half this size. But if you want this system to live, and to be better than ever (without all the sjw, islamist, corporate, and discriminatory shit), liberalism is the answer, though if I understand neo-liberalism correctly, I exclude it from that statement. I may quote Hayek, but his neo-liberal philosophy shared by the corporate/political class is an abomination of liberal thought that betrays the very premises of liberalism.  Social justice isnt the only threat, though they are allied with the other one. Corporations (+ Saudi Arabia, because a lot of this applies to them too) are much more dangerous and powerful threat to the free world, and have been tearing away at our constitutional rights and individual sovereignty for much longer than the marxian types. We need to start thinking of corporations as collectivists too, because that’s literally what they are. Corporations are collectives asserting themsselves as single personal entities with group rights apart from human rights (“corporations are people”, citizens united), entities which are deemed more important than any individual or individual right, and they want control and dominion of the government so they can dominate the economy (because they are the new monopoly men) and ideas (through the media). Corporations have turned western societies from sovergn nations to people under mafia rule. They are organized collectivists, and what they are in the middle of doing is worse than what Stalin did.  Corporations have hijacked our government to mine tax dollars for profit, to exclude themselves from taxes, to control your taxes, to create prohibitions of your rights for profit (guns, drugs, prostitution, abortion, and much more), to profiteer off of human livestock in prisons, to get the government to arbitrarily massively over-stock their products (weapons, prisons, and much more), to get the government to arbitrarily give them money even after wrecking the economy (emergency stabilization act, signed by Hillary, Obama, and Bush), using the military as their mercenary to securing their markets, using laws and government agencies to stomp out competing markets, to create regulations that stomp out competition, to deregulate anything that is inconvenient for their profits including health and environmental protections, to protect and organize illegal trade including massive human trafficking rinks involving very prominant members of society. And worst of all, they’ve uplifted tarrifs for themselves using their control of the US government to create “free trade“ in which they can legally exploit third world workers to a much higher profit margin than they could with american workers. They can hijack those third world governments too (because they already rigged the most powerful nation in the world) and stagnate those nation’s wages, stagnate their progress of human rights and individual sovereignty, all at the expense of our nation’s jobs. In the case of China, this provided an economy for the totalitarian communist government to maintain power instead of collapsing under its own incompetent system and being replaced by a more liberal system. This process of outsourcing (including outsourcing jobs to prisoners) has made us disposible workers with the dilemma of having indefinitely stagnated wages while we slowly lose power in the system to corporations and tyrants, working ourselves to death trying to sustain ourselves until it just doesnt work anymore, either that or we could loosing our jobs (and sbsequently our system of wealth and protecting human rights) by raising minimum wage (which will now only result in closing jobs here and moving them abroad to slave laborers).  Corporate imperiaism is real, and it’s just as big as radical islam and marxism, they own the media that informs the Republican and Democratic party, and they are allies leading with the christian conservatives, the marxists, and enabling the islamists alike. They support each of these special interest groups because they gain power from misleading them, and/or profiteer off of these groups efforts. It’s called playing both sides of the chessboard. The corporate/political class is what has been enabling all the problems we’ve seen with Islamism, christian dominionism, and social justice as of late (though this particular relationship with the marxian types appears to be new). They’re also behind the drug war, war on terror, and over policing.  **The Golden Truth**:  Valid Premise, Sound Conclusion  Invalid Premise, Sound Conclusion  Valid Premise, Unsound Conclusion  Invalid Premise, Unsound Conclusion  "

I LOVE that he came in, and by saying a bunch of VERY controversial things, he pulled the biggest upset in political history. I LOVE what he did, not because I believe in his policies (because I do not) nor do I believe in ANY politician policies. I LOVE what he did because he gave what has essentially become the biggest middle finger In history to the American political system. Pretty much said ""watch this shit"" and then pulled it off. Love it.   - I love how butt hurt everyone in my age range (30-39) is about Trump being president. I defend him mostly to piss other people off, not because I feel he needs defending. I love the shit he pulls on twitter. I love seeing those people who were on Hillary Clinton's side say ""not my president"". Its hilarious to me.   -Most of all, I love the fire his election started. I believe this country is on its way to a ""cold civil war"" but at least people care. Apathy is a very dangerous state to be in and I feel that for that last 8 years, so many people were apathetic to the whole process that people were becoming complacent. That is not acceptable.

I think this completely vindicates the driver of any accusation that the car crash was an ""attack"" or pre-meditated murder.  -  &gt; A police officer radioed for help as angry protesters swarmed around her: “They are pushing the crowd my way and I have nobody here to help me.”  &gt; Tammy Shiflett, who had just returned to active duty as an elementary school resource officer after two months recovering from a shoulder surgery, was the only person assigned to block traffic at the intersection where a deadly car attack began in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.  &gt; Instead of sending reinforcements, a superior instructed her to abandon her post and move the car that had been positioned in the intersection, leaving a wooden sawhorse as the only barrier keeping vehicles out of the area. Roughly an hour and a half later, a white nationalist drove his car down that very street, striking a crowd of counterprotesters and killing 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer.  &gt; The decision by police officials to set up only minimal barriers in preparation for the white nationalist rally and then, in one particularly grave case, to withdraw from a “crucial” intersection was among the dozens of mistakes, missteps and failures cited in a damning report commissioned by the city and publicly released Friday.  ...  &gt; The report is particularly critical of the traffic plan, noting that city personnel had proposed using jersey barriers or dump trucks to block intersections, but that the idea was inexplicably discarded. And despite having more than 700 police officers on hand to respond to the event, police decided in some cases to assign unsworn police personnel, including a lab technician, to secure the event perimeter and keep vehicles out.   -  My takeaway from this report is that if a police officer felt so unsafe that they had to abandon post, then the conditions were such that it's not unreasonable to expect a driver to panic. While no videos show what happened before the acceleration, we can see that [the protesters in question were not alt right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeB2ZaUSa48) We know they aren't alt right because of the distinct lack of [white polos and khakis.](http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2017/08/12/rts1bg20.jpg) While not every alt righter dressed up, it seems improbable that the crowd would select for only those who didn't.   -  ____________________ ____________________  -  While I wanted to focus on the car, I would like to list some other key findings in the report. None of the following is retconned and everything listed can be found explicitly within the article:   -  Police were instructed not to break up violence, unless there was a serious injury involved. Police were instructed specifically to stay behind barricades instead of breaking up fights. Police officers were instructed that if it gets violent, to go inside their police cars and lock the doors. One police officer was reported to have instructed others to ""let them fight"" in order to make it easier to declare unlawful assembly and shut down the rally. That same officer was caught trying to obstruct the investigation by deleting communications.   -  The city had the authority to ban clubs and other weapons that were not firearms, but chose not to. One officer described the police as ""sitting there with [their] thumbs up [their] asses."" Instead of focusing on the prevention of violence, officers ""focused on declaring an unlawful assembly"".   -  ____________________  _____________________  _____________________  -  My takeaway: Judging by the procedural hurdles that the alt right had to jump through, as well as statements by Governor Terry Mcauliffe about wanting Virginia to be one of the most aggressive centers of The Resistance, I think that the conditions for chaos were deliberately set up and I think that the police officer telling others to deliberately let violence occur in order to call it an unlawful assembly corroborates my suspicion a lot.   -  With the exception of Antifa, who are an explicitly violent group (the black bloc is a tactic deliberately done to make it harder to find perps of violence and vandalism), I don't blame ordinary left-wing protesters for chaos in Charlottesville, because it seems that state and local officials were deliberately breeding that chaos to occur. For that reason though, I also think that it's completely unreasonable to consider the violence to be the alt right's goal in Charlottesville or to consider the car crash an ""attack"". "
"There's yet another post on the front page talking about how great healthcare is in Sweden and Canada compared to the US.  And while I agree that our healthcare system is broken and need to be fixed, it's funny how Reddit refuses to look as to *why* our healthcare is so expensive.   A big part of that is illegal aliens. (I know it, you know it, everyone knows it) but let me show you the facts.  ---------  Even on the low-end estimates there are 12 million illegal aliens in the US, but the real numbers are significantly higher. Between 300K-400K children are born each year to parents in the country illegaly (that we know of). They don't get counted since ""technically"" they're Americans. And according to liberal math if an alien gets deported 6 times, but comes back into the country, that's 6 illegals you can scrub from the official statistics.   As Trump has pointed out, for some reason we've had 11 million ""official"" illegal aliens in our country for the past 10 years.   From: http://archive.is/6RItp  &gt;Trump suggested he was skeptical of the 11 million figure because it’s ""always"" been the estimate. Experts told us there’s a good explanation for that: a steady flow of people coming in and leaving.  &gt;""The reason that he has heard the same number for years is that the population has not been growing,"" said Warren.  &gt;""There’s enormous churn in the illegal immigration population. **Hundreds of thousands come in at 11 million and then hundreds of thousands leave** *(yeah, right)*,"" Camarota said, adding that **the undocumented population is a demographically unusual group as it can’t grow by births (as all children born in the United States are citizens).**  &gt;But even if you folded in these citizen children, the number would be 17 million at most, he said. *(we're supposed accept that a 50% margin of error is normal?)*  &gt;**While the federal estimate hasn’t been updated in a few years, experts agreed that the outside groups’ calculations are sound.** *(So who's right? The government or outside groups?)* Still, Camarota criticized the government for not providing a more recent figure.  Here's Mexico's former ambassador using the 30 million figure: http://archive.is/wLWJ6  ---------------  Most people would agree that it's better that a hospital remains open to give treatment at slightly more expense, rather than it closing down so that no one gets treatment, but a little bit here and there and you end up with massive costs.  Even on this report from 2009 we see that: http://archive.is/bKKeZ  ""In some hospitals, as much as two-thirds of total operating costs are for uncompensated care for illegal aliens.""  ""425,000 births a year in the U.S.—more than 1 in every 10 births—is to an illegal alien mother""  And the biggest problem is they're using emergency services as their primary healthcare which is the most expensive, and then pay nothing towards the costs. (You know, that thing the MSM crucified Mitt Romney for suggesting)  &gt;Lack of insurance leads many immigrants to use hospital emergency departments—the most expensive source of health care—as their primary care provider. This leads to overcrowded conditions for citizens who seek emergency care. Nationwide, emergency room visits increased by 36 percent from 1996 to 2006. **The problem has become so out of control that Mexican ambulance companies are being allowed to drive uninsured patients across the U.S. border to receive free treatment.**   &gt;**Because emergency rooms must treat patients regardless of their ability to pay, high rates of uninsured patients can spell financial disaster for hospitals.** The cost of caring for these patients is absorbed by the counties or hospitals obligated to provide treatment, and some is passed onto insured patients. The average added cost an insured individual pays to cover treatment of the uninsured has been put at $370 a year, while for a family it is an additional $1,000 a year.  &gt;**Many illegal aliens are taking advantage of legislation that requires emergency rooms to treat all patients, regardless of ability or intent to pay for the treatment.** The cost of uncompensated care to taxpayers and insured patients continues to rise. Uncompensated costs has caused some hospitals to reduce staff, increase rates, cut back services, and close maternity wards and trauma centers""  There was a story earlier this year about a 10 year old girl with cerebral palsy getting free treatment in the US - http://archive.is/1tLDd  Here's the kicker. It's not like we're paying for someone's $20 prescription. We're paying for **emergency surgeries and ongoing home treatment from trained therapists.** Americans who actually pay for insurance don't get healthcare this good.  &gt;They had not been able to afford her therapies in Mexico, she said, but in Texas, Medicaid paid for her daughter’s treatment, which included home visits from therapists.  ----------  I don't see Canada or Sweden offering to let in Americans to use their healthcare for free. It's ironic that the nations that love their free healthcare the most are the ones that **only give it out to their own citizens**. And then have the audacity to criticize the US that is not only already giving away more free healthcare than their countries combined, forcing hardworking Americans to shoulder the financial burden, but then proceed to spit in our face and say that we're somehow still not doing enough.  We have so many illegal aliens draining the the welfare and healthcare systems that it's enough to replace the entire populations of Belgium (11M), Denmark (5M), Norway (5M), and Sweden (10M) COMBINED.  It's easy to gloat about your healthcare when Americans are protecting your borders, securing your trade routes, and subsidizing the bulk of medical R&amp;D costs so that you can have first-world treatment.

"Ever notice that whenever someone starts a Twitter hashtag game, there's always gotta be those people who think it's cute to force criticisms of Trump in there? It gets very old and predictable.  For example, very recently there was a hashtag called #MakeMeWantYouin5Words. One of the first responses? Of course, it was ""I don't support Donald Trump"".  These people can't be sane. I'm sure they check under their beds for Donald Trump at night, and see his face in their alphabet soup.

"You can get an app called Castbox for free that has all of these and more after they air.    Podcasts to listen to in my order of favorite to least.  Dan Bongino Show.  Far and away my favorite. Very down to earth, breaks down huge topics into layman terms and has been covering everything from taxes, uranium one, democrat demagoguery, shies away from foreign policy for the most part but still covers it.  He's like a smarter based Joe Rogan in a way, with how he speaks.  Also has a great economic understanding of things and offers his perspective as a former federal agent / secret service agent.  He was also a republican candidate for congress a couple of times.  I listen to him before anyone else, after I finish the latest episode I move on to any of the three.  Mark Levin.  He's been fucking fire lately outright fighting to support trump for hours a day.  Don't give me no never trump bullshit, Levin has been linguistically beating down the uranium one story and many others.  He may disagree sometimes but he urges libertarians to stop being petty and realize this is the president that encompasses many of their positions on things and it's the closest they've had.  Larry Elder. This man talks like Jazz.  Smooth, rhythmic, compassionate, and talks about real issues.  He's been leaning toward believing Roy Moore is guilty to some degree but is willing to listen to the side that supports more.  Plays segments of listener calls that criticize him after the break to give them air time and sometimes he refutes them, other times he just goes on with the show.  Michael Savage.  His shtick against trump sometimes gets annoying.  He whines a lot against trump and does have his head up his ass.  But he's the original Borders, Language, and culture  guy that has largely influenced the movement that Trump ran on.  He's very wise and talks in a way that you swear he's having a conversation with you.  Overall a very wise man and usually a delight as he talks about all sorts of subjects."

"Favorite Beata Szydlo out as Prime Minister of Poland.  When Morawiecki visited the US, he only met with Yellen/FED. He is a 40 some year old multi-millionaire. Morawiecki was a member in WSI which is the Polish army intelligence (known as heartless agents in PL as they make deals w the European mafia and drug dealers) = Polish deep state. He has connections to Wall Street, nicknamed 'Bankster' by right wing media. Tusk allowed many Polish resources to become privatized by foreigners - Morawiecki was part of Tusk's government and switched more recently to PIS, this is the gateway for part 2. The right wing will now be weakened and split due to Szydlo loyalists and the people who actually voted her in. Unlike Morawiecki who is being abruptly placed in her spot by Duda. This is one of many harmful decisions which Duda has made since rising in Popularity with the help of President Trump. Duda is not Poland First and can't compared to my favorite President. ."

"GEN Flynn didn’t lie to the Special Counsel investigators, which hadn’t been established until the end of May 2017, he lied to an FBI agent in January. So why did GEN Flynn lie to the FBI about something that was politically sensitive, rather than illegal?   1. The FBI was leaking everything at the time – they had even leaked GEN Flynn’s intercepted calls to the media and other FISA-protected communications. Flynn knew if he gave politically sensitive information to the FBI, it would immediately be leaked and used against the Trump admin.  2. Who is the FBI? At the time, the four most senior people were FBI Director James Comey, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI General Counsel (the FBI’s powerful senior lawyer) James A Baker, and Chief Investigator Peter Strzok. These were also the people on Comey’s “Mid-year exam” email exonerating Clinton before Clinton herself and numerous senior aids had even been interviewed, and language was modified to avoid criminal  prosecution.  3. James Comey has since outed himself as a leaker.  4. Andrew “First we fuck Flynn, then we fuck Trump” McCabe is under active investigation for his clear conflicts of interest relating to being the beneficiary of hundreds of thousands of dollars of Clinton surrogate’s “campaign donations” to his wife.  5. James Baker, General Counsel, is reportedly under investigation for leaking national security information to the media in order to damage Trump. This revelation was made by the excellent Sarah Carter of Circa in July, and was not refuted by Baker or the FBI. https://www.circa.com/story/2017/07/27/politics/a-top-fbi-lawyer-is-allegedly-under-an-investigation-for-leaking-classified-information-to-the-media  6. Peter Strzok had blatant political bias, revealed in text messages that only could have been picked up as part of DOJ’s numerous active investigations into criminal leaks. There is no other way these messages could have been legally obtained. Strzok is also the guy who allowed Heather Mills to sit in on Hillary Clinton’s “interview” as her legal counsel, despite herself being a key witness in the “matter”. He has also presumably spun up the immunity deals for everyone from Clinton’s staff and IT people, to her house keeper.  So GEN Flynn made an impulsive decision to avoid giving politically sensitive information to the FBI about his legal and sanctioned calls to the Russian Ambassador because he knew that if he did, then that information would be selectively sliced, diced, spun and leaked – as had been done numerous times before and since.  It’s a reasonable assumption to make, given that at the time there were several leaks a day coming from the government’s Departmental holdover bureaucrats. Remember, this was less than a month into the Trump admin, well before Sessions, Wray et al.  Also – Bill Clinton has an ambiguous interpretation of legal consent.  TL;DR - The FBI were leaking, compromised hacks when Flynn spoke with them in January, and Bill Clinton is a Rapist  Spez: It seems I confused the Clinton’s amoral legal lackey with Paul McCartney’s one-legged former squeeze.  I’m going to leave it as “Heather” Mills so in 100 years the comments below make sense to historians when they are researching why history’s greatest president was so persecuted early in his reign. "

He was adamant that the liberals are determined to destroy the best, the greatest, the most sweet and good nation ever formed in the history of the world. I see it now. The distortion, the lies of the fake news. The courts dismantling our laws. The culture of decadent virtue signaling. Pedes, this country has done more than any other society to make things better. We fought for free speech, the right to pursue happiness, no taxation without representation, equal rights for women. We fought the war of all wars to end slavery, which was once a common practice throughout the world. Industrialization and now the tech revolution has made ACTUAL LIVING so much less miserable for millions and millions of human beings. America haters/liberals are just so wrong. WHAT MAKES US GREAT IS OUR CONSTITUTION. Nothing more than that. We are not superior morally, nor in any other way. We Americans are mortals just like everyone else in the world. But one thing is very different about our country. Our Constitution is a brilliant piece of work, wrought by men who were well educated and who tasted freedom, when they came to this great land and away from the tyranny of Europe. It is our Constitution that makes us so unlike the evil Empire and storm troopers. Think Constitution. Meme it, study it, live it. Maybe then, we can make the world a better place. We were on the way until Marxism, disguised as Liberalism, reared it's hideous head once more. Don't fall for their disinformation. *We are NOT the stormtroopers, but the ORIGINAL rebel force."

"I have a couple dozen reddit golds I bought many years ago... the money is already paid, so what should I do with them since the dom doesn’t believe in it (for good fucking reason!)?"
"This is mostly a repost from a post I just saw in another sub (not sure about rules on brigading and linking outside of T_D so I don’t want to link to it) but shoutout to /u/bacare   I’ve been a part of this dom-reddit since the end of the primaries last summer and I’m all in on most things around here.   Is the swamp made up of a uniparty consisting of Democrats and establishment Republicans? Duh  Is the swamp trying to take down Donald Trump because he’s out to destroy the corrupt system they’ve built for themselves? Of course  Is George Soros and a cabal of globalist elites behind the resistance against the President; astroturfing demonstrations, organizing riots, and manipulating the media? You betcha  Is that group of globalist elites facilitating child trafficking ring for their own sexual depravity and in some cases feasting on the energy of children like ‘psychic vampires’ and dabbling in satanic witchcraft?   Uh...   That’s always been a hard pill to swallow. The idea that ‘initiating’ people into the elite class by holding sexual blackmail over their heads has a logic to it. The notion that these people are sexually depraved and get their thrills through some sick shit is believable. They’re definitely using coded language to talk about something in those emails. Spirit cooking is a thing and the contacts between Abrimavic and the elites is documented. The fact that they have contempt for traditional religion, particularly Christianity is obvious. But still... That’s a big bite to chew on.   But I just came across another post that had (mostly) this same stuff posted:  https://imgur.com/a/IFLs0  A group called The Ordinary People’s Society registered 5,000 voters in about 30 jails and prisons in Alabama leading up to yesterday’s election.   The Ordinary People’s Society (TOPS) is a leftwing advocacy, activist, organizing organization lead by Kenneth Glasgow, one of their big focuses has been on voting rights for felons.  http://www.theordinarypeoplesociety.org   Kenneth Glasgow, also known as Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow is Rev. Al Sharpton’s half-brother (and also apparently nephew?). Seriously just read the article, wtf? http://wkrg.com/2016/06/29/news-5-investigates-kenneth-glasgows-complicated-connection-to-rev-al-sharpton/  This article from 2015: http://www.rickeystokesnews.com/article.php/dothan-pastor-kenny-glasgow-accused-of-sexual-assault-and-practicing-satanic-rituals-132947  Describes sexual assault with Glasgow’s “church” along with witchcraft rituals wherein Glasgow uses the dirt from the graves of young black men shot by the police to try and put hexes on local judges and police officers, as well as, what “Sources we spoke with, in strict confidence, that fear the pastor, that used to be members of the TOPS  church, described a secret church within the church.  Some people are secretly initiated into this inner circle of followers. You don't want to know what they really do as it involves a lot more than dirt from people’s graves.”  For transparency’s sake - I was skeptical of “rickystokesnews.com”. It seems to be some guy’s blog that deals in local news around Dothan, Alabama. Ricky Stokes is apparently a bail bondsman who was once found guilty of, “two counts of second-degree unlawful imprisonment for chaining two men to the municipal courthouse doors in June.” when the police wouldn’t take custody of the two men he had out on bail. Sounds like an alright guy to me. Lol  So there you have it, not really sure what it’s all about but apparently Al Sharpton’s half-brother/nephew was out registering prisoners to vote in Tuesday’s special election when he wasn’t busy sexually assaulting women and digging dirt from graves to be used in voodoo rituals against cops and judges. Wtf... "
"Amazon is launching a new service for gun owners, the Firearms Total Care Package. The service includes picking your firearms up every weekday morning, holding them for safe keeping while you are at work, and cleaning them, servicing them, and making sure they are peak performance at all times.They will be delivered back to your home for you at the end of the day as well. The best part is, this entire service will be free of charge, it will be paid for by your property taxes. Of course, Amazon will be requesting supply donations at the beginning of each new year, such as cloth squares and oil, and cleaning solvent. You are encouraged to supply extra to cover those who may not be able to donate. They cant guarantee that the supplies you donate will go to use on your firearms, but they assure that every effort will be made to provide an equitable experience for every firearm. They even claim that faulty firearms will be kept along side the fully functional ones, in an effort to assure that every firearm has access to the best gunsmiths. Similar paid services are being offered starting next year, from a few gun manufacturers, but you are encouraged to shy away from these, as it will take valuable resources away from Amazon's service, and the fear is that it will lead to future shortfalls in available funds for properly servicing every firearm. Additionally, Amazon has developed a patented Common Range system for insuring that every firearm has been tested and brought to the same set of standards so that each one functions equally as well as every other one. This service is set to be launched at the beginning of the year, and within the next 2 years Congress has proposed setting up mandatory guidelines to insure that each firearm is accounted for and that the proper service levels are being administered to all. Self cleaning and servicing will be strongly discouraged, as it will be unknown as to how these firearms will function in proximity to other properly serviced firearms. Please make every effort to inventory your firearms and prepare for registering them into this service."

These things are so profound that he has to take them head on.  This is the beginning of the end of their world.""  Whoa!   He said ""Sessions has absolute obligation to prosecute Comey and staff.  It is very likely they will end up going to jail.  It was a cesspool of corruption the way they covered up for Clinton.  The level of  constant, methodical undermining of the rule of law at top level of FBI and DOJ  is the greatest crisis in American history.

Well, it's gone when Net Neutrality is repealed. All those times the server crashes and you can't use reddit, that will happen more often now. All those crashes you have on EA servers now, they increase by 5%. Do you remember what the internet was like before Net Neutrality in 2015? I don't, but it wasn't good.

"Now that they're are (most likely) done with the investigation into Trump they WANT to be fired.

'we were stopped from doing the full job'...    Don't fall for their ploy, force the investigators to finish out their sham."

"You might have seen this actor starring on as a child on a TV series on one of those kid-friendly networks.  They witnessed the horror of a certain TV producer first-hand. Minor children were manipulated into adult situations under the threat of losing their job and their career.  It wasn’t, “Either you do this or you are fired!” It was more subtle and more manipulative than that. It would start with, “I’m thinking of something for your character. Will you try this costume on for me?” or “Can you pose for me like this?” That’s how it started. If you said OK, then next time it would be more.  If you balked, he would hint at cutting back on your lines, or giving your lines to someone else, or writing your character off the show. He would say, “Actors your age are a dime a dozen. Do you know how many kids auditioned for your role?”  He seemed to target those kids whose families were most dependent on the child actor’s salary. He would say, “Your family is so lucky to have you. It would be really hard them if you weren’t working, wouldn’t it?” It’s a terrible burden to put on a child.  This particular actor isn’t sure about whether he/she is ready to come forward.  There are dozens or hundreds of kids and parents and directors who all know about this. I don’t want to be the face of this. I am really hoping someone else will come forward first. I’m hearing some chatter that might happen soon, but I’m waiting to see.  "

"I understand that many of you are upset that Roy Moore lost. You also probably want to go the easy way and blame it on the lies of Gloria Alred's fraud yearbook and false accusers. But Donald Trump won Alabama with 28% margin, despite the same Gloria (and her daughter Lisa Bloom) paraded a dozen false accusers. It's possible that the false accusers cost a few % to Moore and that's why he lost narrowly. But in Alabama, a MAGA candidate should have won by 20+%. Sessions won 63-37 in 2008 and in 2014 the Ds didn't even bother to set a candidate. This is where Roy Moore managed to get into a tight race.  Why? Because while we know the RINOs and the MAGA republicans, there is a third group that we use to ignore: evangelicals and their backward ideas. What are the political evangelical positions:  * Christian fundamentalism (Bible over ""we the people""). While we like to trigger liberals with memes with crosses, the truth is that the Biblical commands aren't much different from the Quran's. Have you ever had sex outside of marriage? That's Haram according to the Bible and you'll burn in Hell! Oh and beside the cross, can you tell any difference between [this](http://images.wisegeek.com/catholic-nun.jpg) and [this](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/07/17/nike-hijab-02.jpg)?  Modern countries were built on *secularism* and not Christianism. The freedom of religion is explicitly declared in the first amendment of the US constitution. ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"".  * Anti abortion: seriously, I can't wrap my head around why would anyone care what happens with fetuses that aren't his. Not like any fetus ever paid tax, created jobs or served in the military. Also, nothing stops you from having one every year (assuming you have a partner who agrees having 20+ kids). Trump was pro-choice most of his life, he changed to fit to the R, but never campaigned on it.  * Anti-gay: seriously. Why do you care what other people do in their bedroom? Trump surely won a few votes (which might got him the election considering the tight margins), by this [picture](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/02/13/trump-lgbt.jpg). Sure, the ""transgender children"" nonsense is outrageous, but you can't reject gays for that liberal nonsense. Roy Moore as Alabama chief justice ordered lower courts to ignore the Supreme Court decision on gay marriage. How is it better than 9.th circus nonsense on the travel ban?!  The Trump campaign (the MAGA position) were the following points:  * anti-immigration (wall, deportation force, abolish DACA)  * anti globalism (no international treaties should limit the sovereignty of the country)  * anti-international trade (no TPP, renegotiate or quit NAFTA, border tax)  This is what propelled Trump to perform the largest upset in history: a total political rookie winning the US presidency with 95% media endorsing the other candidate who spent 2x more, spied on his campaign and sent thugs to incite violence on his rallies *and* sent 12 false accusers.  **This** is what future candidates must run on if you want to win, because **this** is very popular. What he must **not** run on is the evangelical nonsense, because that's widely unpopular. The liberals gained all their positions by fighting this backward religious fundamentalism. They will keep winning against them.  Sure, one should guarantee that the evangelicals can have their freedom of religion and can't be forced to perform abortions or make gay cakes. Funnily, that's more than enough, since liberals openly want to destroy Christianity and ban even ""Merry Christmas"". But a future MAGA candidate must make it clear that he will neither force anyone to keep an unwanted baby or not be openly gay or openly atheist.  .  PS: Hungary's Fidesz party ran on anti-immigration and anti-globalism, without a peep on abortion or gays (politicians deflected and gave no-answer bullshit when pressed) while answering ""we believe in freedom of religion"" to every question about religions. The result: so big majority that they could rewrite the constitution. This works everywhere. "
"Go after news outlets who quote ""unnamed sources"" or ""sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to publicly speak about the matter"". Name your sources or do not quote them. Even adding a disclaimer, no one reads that and most uninformed idiots will believe it as facts anyway and repeat it to more uninformed idiots. If you force people to disclose where they got their information under penalty, maybe there will be a little less of this intentionally fake news.   Not specifically naming their sources to be independently verified is their main cop out so they can get away with it."

Why did Peter have such influence to conduct all these interviews and non interviews and have the ability to dictate what Comey said.

"With the Pentagon soon to release proof of alien life, DJT is bringing onto the battlefield his great benefactors. ALIENS! The date is December 31st, 1999. Daddy, likely in an intergalactic astral-projection (the form which his dreams most often take), is able to reach further into the bosom of our universe than ever before on the cosmic tide of the millennium's turning. Deep into the velvet black open of space, he met aliens who communicated with the same language as in Arrival (YUGE movie, go watch it, top notch cinema). They worked out a phenomenal deal. Donald explained how the baby-raping Satanist Cabal threatened our planet and the country we all love, and the aliens revealed that progressive-aristocrats are a viral scourge plaguing the Galaxy. They agree to teach DJT their language, giving him the power to think non-linearly, to see clearly the future and know in advance details of coming events.   The Donald awoke from his restful slumber, with one thing on his mind. He began his planning, slowly gathering knowledge and pieces for his 4D chessboard. Reaching into the future and then acting to bend it to his will. All we know now, the plays, the moves, the wins, the fakeouts... All part of an assured cosmic dance.   THIS is how DJT appears to travel through time, how he IS playing 4D chess, and that the aliens are coming to aide in the final liberation of our planet and people from Moloch.   But Donald needs something from us, he needs your energy. America needs your energy. Optimism and positivity; virtue, belief, and conviction are the propellant of the American way... What will one day be the Human way... And the Galaxy's basis of good.   Vote Pedes. Every single thing you do has an immeasurable effect in the infinite. Vote every single time you can for every stupid little election. Work hard. Do your jobs well and spread the wealth you build. Empower your children, send forth strong and caring new people to add to our great experiment. Consider everything you do, because it is, an addition to the American way... And feel pride for the honor of living in such a timeline as it's true grandure unfolds.   Trump is fueled by your energy, with all the alien foresight he still needs you. Yes, YOU there reading this, beautiful American. Yes you there Pede. And Even you there hater of Trump, you are welcome in our family.

"I know I probably could have taken the easy way out when tasked with finding a picture to describe myself and the society around me, but just one picture kept reverting back to my head over and over again. I know it’s a controversial topic that many choose not to talk about in public but this is something that I feel passionate about and believe tells a message. That one message that appears over and over in my head is that society can’t handle adversity anymore.        This picture shows me at the inauguration, it was a cold and dreary day but the hope of me and 300,000 others was at an all-time high. I know just the name of Donald Trump sparks debate, riots, and tears, but to me Trump signifies something more than another President in the White House. In a time where political correctness and smooth-talking politicians is a mainstay, it was nice to see someone as transcendent as Donald Trump step into the political arena and eventually end up in the White House. The problem in our society right now is not Donald Trump but it is how many people in our society today can’t handle adversity and they want everything handed to them. When something doesn’t go their way the only logical reaction is to cause disorder, a sense of entitlement if you ask me. I don’t think like that, I chose my own path and I identify myself with people and causes that I genuinely believe in. This picture shows me the first time I experienced what hope felt like. Before that I never really looked at the bigger picture. I never looked into sources when I saw news. I never saw things in a deeper meaning. The man in the picture began to form his own opinions, his own beliefs, and his own identity.  The cleavages of American public are disheartening to me. This country needs to be unified in a time where nuclear attacks are as realistic as the sky being blue. I’m not a steadfast conservative Republican who can’t fathom the idea of a Democrat being our president. I’m not a misogynist, racist, unintelligent, or a womanizer. The fact that I can’t go into school feeling safe wearing a Donald Trump shirt really concerns me, especially in the year 2017. Adversity is what this great country is based on. If the Sons of Liberty couldn’t handle adversity we would still be controlled by Great Britain. Did our founders create safe spaces to speak out against the tyrannical King George? No, they got on their feet and worked to gain independence. In this country, today, the whole idea of adversity is out the window. When something doesn’t go the way people want it to they immediately go to the streets to protest even if they aren’t fully informed on the issue. I’m not saying protests are a bad thing, but eventually there needs to be a will to stop whining and actually go ahead and work against whatever force is holding you back. I’ve handled adversity many times in my lifetime. Sure I got down and thought there was no hope but I don’t blame others for my misfortune. I’ve learned that regardless of what happens in my life I’ll be able to handle it with ease after seeing someone like Donald Trump get belittled by every major news network and celebrity in the country. It gave me hope that America can become the place that my father tells me about. The hard-working men and women that built this great country on their backs. The 9-5 workers who give their all to provide for their family. The days where nationalism and being proud to be an American was at an all-time high. Donald Trump changed that narrative in my mind and in the mind of over 50 million people. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Not many people live by that mantra anymore. I consider myself different from those people. I’ve weathered many storms such as grades, social life, and personal issues that could’ve derailed my life. I know I’m young and probably naive, but it doesn’t mean I can’t create an identity for myself or formulate opinions based on what I believe. Playing with house money is when I’m at my best and that’s exactly how Donald Trump is. In this election, he didn’t have anything to lose. He didn’t have to run for president, his life was complete. Why did he decide to run for president and get hate from half the country’s population? Because he didn’t sit back and mope about how our country was being run, he actually did something about it. Whether you like him or not you have to respect that about the man. That’s what America is sorely missing and that’s what was given back to America on January 20th, 2017. I saw it with my own eyes. I followed this cycle from the beginning. America is a country of hope and overcoming adversity. That’s what separates us from the rest of the world. That’s what makes us the best country in the world. That’s what makes me proud of being an American and being able to see the peaceful transition of power at the inauguration.     Another thing I learned about myself and American society is the fact that when you speak your mind, feel passionately about something, or hold opposite opinions of people you are subjected to being ridiculed, mocked, and discredited. What would would’ve happened if Martin Luther King Jr. was censored during his civil rights address? What would’ve happened if Susan B. Anthony was censored during universal suffrage? This country is based upon conflicting views and resolving them. The way we are today I could be called a racist for just wearing a Make America Great Again hat. Do Americans not want to get back to the time where we truly believed we were the greatest nation in the world? How can we make strides in equality among all when half the population can’t even share their opinion? This isn’t a political party thing either. This goes beyond both sides of the aisle. I’ve learned to accept different races, ethnicities, and religion from the values instilled in me from my parents. If we can’t even accept our president then how can we make strides to unify and bring equality to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, or religion. This has taught me how to remain strong to your beliefs and regardless of what someone calls you, the sun will always rise tomorrow. I’ve learned to get thicker skin and not be afraid to make a remark that could offend people because it offends me that I can’t be free to speak my mind in the freest country in the world. That’s the core values that makes America such a wonderful place to call home. Now it’s part of the reason that’s making America so fragmented. America is better than this. America deserves better than this as well. Since January 20th 2017, my perspective on life has changed. I see things past the exterior now. I understand the values that America was based upon. I know I will most likely offend people by writing this narrative, but 12 months ago I wouldn’t have had the guts to speak my mind like this. A man, who many can’t bear to even acknowledge, has made a lasting impact on my life and regardless of how people look at him remains to be a role model in how I want to live my life.      “Take adversity and make it an asset” is a quote from Donald Trump that really encapsulates my message of this essay. The man in that picture has faced his fair share of adversity. Every human on this planet has faced adversity as well. People fear when things go wrong or out of their control. It’s a bad mindset in today’s world. You don’t need to be the most intelligent person out there to be successful. You don’t need a 1600 on your SAT to be successful. When all the chips are down and no one is there to hold your hand through it, being able to pick yourself up and stare adversity directly in the face is what defines the most successful people on this planet. No one gets through life without facing tough times where all hope is lost and the only person who believes in you is yourself. Steve Jobs was kicked out of his own company, Bill Gates’ first business was a complete failure, Albert Einstein was rejected from college, and Michael Jordan was cut from his varsity basketball team. These people shaped society to how we look at it today. In a time where it’s acceptable to whine and feel entitled to everything, I learned the valuable lesson of being able to handle adversity and make it an asset.  "

"I laughed with you when those with large liberal platforms disrespected or openly called for harm or uprising against our president. I dismissed it as a coincidental happening until now.  Virtually all who hold public platforms who have openly disrespected Trump or those who follow him have been dealt with accordingly. From large corporate entity's to media personalities to entire media organizations. We see sports superstars and entertainment performers be rewarded for support and damaged physically and financially to varying degrees based upon issues ranging from disrespect to calls for assassination.  This list cannot be ignored as simple coincidence. Starbucks lost 13% in stock devaluation in one month after the disrespect of our president and military. Charlie Ross, Chris Matthews, along with CNN and MSNBC have lost all credibility with the general public. We see a plethora of virtue signaling Hollywood celebrity brought to their knees and carers ruined after calling our president a sexual predator only to find out they where indeed the true predators.   We see sports personalities like Kappernick who have lost their careers and many who called for open revolt or physical harm to POTUS or his supporters finding themselves injured soon after. We see ESPN and even the once thought untouchable NFL brought to ruin while facing their fanbase abandoning in droves. We see political figures long thought of as Democratic stalwarts brought down over a weekend Conyers, Franken, and others.  This isn't coincidental I truly believe that Trump is divinely touched. I am not even truly religious yet I can't help but seeing that this is indeed the reason surrounding what happens to those who seek to usurp the will of America or publicly insight violence or uprising against Trump or those like us who support him.."

"How does a campaign in chaos every day be so good at hiding evidence from Mueller's Team vs. A Well Funded Veteran Organized Campaign known as the Clinton Machine? Let's face it Democrats wanted Comey gone and now he. So they scream Obstruction of Justice after being on the record calling for him to be removed. Perhaps maybe just maybe Trump ran a Legitimate Campaign after all Defeating all 15 GOP Opponents and Clinton at the same time as well as 4 Former Presidents, and the Establishment Media. If Trump was Guilty the Paper Trail would be a mile long. And after 3 official investigations and multiple illegal investigations nothing has been found so the Media creates Fake Evidence. (Which is really funny considering Trump shoots himself in the foot all the time). No one during the primaries took him seriously at all thinking it's all a joke to him and he's going to drop out any day now. And not once was Russia mentioned because Obama told Trump to stop whining about Election Fraud as the ""Election"" is un Hackable. The only time Russia gets mentioned is when Trump trolls the Media after he wins the primaries. Because they don't vet Democrat candidates only Republican ones. He called them out on there failure to investigate Killary's missing subpoenaed emails.   Just on the very knowledge that the Campaign was in Chaos should be easy enough to get impeachable evidence against him. And yet Nothing. "

"What may mean nothing to some can mean a lot to others. I have found myself excited to wish people a Merry Christmas this year. No “happy holidays” anymore for me. I haven’t felt the true joy of Christmas in a long time. This year though that has changed. Saying Merry Christmas is not to shove it in someone’s face. To me it means, on this Christmas,  I hope you as well have a wonderful day. Weather you believe in Christmas or not I wish you have a day to spend time with your family and loved ones. Find the peace you are looking for and enjoy every minute of it. If someone wishes me a happy Hanukkah, or whatever holiday that person is celebrating, I will never be offended, I will take that as a sign that person would like me to also enjoy the day they do, and I will. So to everyone here and everyone everywhere, Merry Christmas, enjoy the day with family and loved ones and for those that can’t be with the ones they want to, I will think of you and pray that one day you can be together!

"Trump's lack of Decorum.....?  I don’t know who originated it, but it surely needed to be said. This is the best analysis of our current political situation that I have yet seen. Please read it and give it some careful thought. The liberals (Democrats, Socialists, Communists) are much more cunning than we conservatives. They understand political warfare far better than the conservatives. But is that kind of cunning that we want as Americans?  I think not —- I hope not!   Trump's lack of decorum, dignity, and statesmanship.  My leftist friends (as well as many ardent #Never-Trumpers) constantly ask me if I'm not bothered by Donald Trump's lack of decorum. They ask if I don't think his tweets are ""beneath the dignity of the office.""  Here's my answer:  We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency.  We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized ""collegiality"" as John McCain?  We tried propriety - has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney?  And the results were always the same. This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality, and propriety, the leftists have been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.  - I don't find anything ""dignified"", ""collegial"", or ""proper"" about Barack Obama lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party.  - I don't see anything ""dignified"" in Obama and Hillary lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover their tracks.  - I don't see anything ""statesman-like"" in Obama weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy his political opponents and any dissent.  Yes, Obama was ""articulate"" and ""polished"" but in no way was he in the least bit ""dignified,"" ""collegial"", or ""proper.""  The leftists have been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the '60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they've fought with the threat of violence, demagoguery, lies, and actual violence (the violent take-over of the universities) from day one - until today.  The problem is that, through these years, the leftists have been the only side fighting this war. While the leftists have been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality, and propriety. With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America 's first wartime president in the Culture War.  During wartime, things like ""dignity"" and ""collegiality"" simply aren't the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that, ""I cannot spare this man. He fights.""  General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum then, Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.  Trump is fighting. And what's particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel's, he's shouting, ""You magnificent bastard, I read your book!""  That is just the icing on the cake, but it's wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he's defeating the left using their own tactics. That book is Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"" - a book so essential to the Liberals' war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton's senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.  Trump's tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after ""the fake media"" - and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri - Trump isolated CNN. He made it personal  Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as ""the most powerful weapon of all."" Most importantly, Trump's tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices. They can either ""go high"" (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery. The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is that, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve.  It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama's close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright's church. Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration's weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration's cover-up.  So, to my friends on the left - and the #NeverTrumpers as well - do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be ""collegial"" and ""dignified"" and ""proper""? Of course I do. These aren't those times. This is war. And it's a war that the leftists have been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years. So, say anything you want about this president - I get it - he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don't care. I can't spare this man. He fights for America!"

"First of all, I hope that everyone had a Merry Christmas and is safe and well. This will be a rather long post but have a LOT to get off my chest and it feels great to finally be able to share it and among so many like minded people.  As a 20 something Black man AKA a milleninal that lives in a liberal hell hole like Boston, Massachusetts, I was raised my entire life with an anti-White mindset and to be as liberal as possible. Fortunately, my core as a person never truly lined up with those ideals and as such I grew up ""weird"" and ""acting White"" for showing any form of intelligence and work ethic by the majority of Blacks and White libs AKA cucks and betas.   Long story short, despite that I conformed to a lot of liberal and ""Black policies"" just because I thought I had to despite being annoyed at much of it and not truly agreeing with it. Thanks to Trump's presidency run and the nonsense the liberals were spouting, I had finally had enough of them and completely embraced that I was team MAGA. I had seen enough of the lack of logic and double standards that were being used and just never sat right with me even as a child.  I've never felt freer, happier and prouder to be an American than ever before after no longer allowing myself to conform to the self-destructive ways of liberals. I can't believe that liberals and most Blacks tried to get me to believe that it was okay to blame Whites for being White, that I was oppressed and a victim, that loving your country and showing patriotism is bad, that Women being women is bad while men lying to themselves about being women was good and just being as anti-American for the country and everyone as it gets.   They whine about everything, are self-righteous and are as hypocritical as it gets. Many turned on me just because I disagreed with them on principle even when I didn't attack them or force my views on them.  Then they made things about race and tried to dictate how I should feel and see, threw out endless personal attacks despite me doing nothing to them and then saying they couldn't be my friend or associate anymore. Funny how they're supposed to be the tolerant, open minded, non-racist, respecting people types they preach about being and why they're better than conservatives yet it goes out the window when people don't conform.  Due to this, I absolutely despise liberals with their delusional emotionally based reasoning (which is phony) and them being the opposite of logic, facts and reality. It's this mindset that they have used to brainwash Blacks for their own ends and are the ACTUAL people oppressing them and that thinks lowly of them. The Democrats were pro slavery and founded the KKK after all. As I see it, Blacks are no longer physically enslaved but they're mentally enslaved by the liberals sick and twisted game as nothing more than mere pawns.   Meanwhile, conservatives welcome me with open arms despite me not going out of my way to appeal to them. I just simply shared we had similar views and immediately they were some of the kindest people ever despite Libs claiming they're opposite of that and hate me just because I'm Black. It's great to be among people with the shared mindset of hard work, proper values, success, being America first and WINNING. The opposite of what Libs are.  After that, it hit me that Libs don't deserve respect as they have none and are also an easy group to troll. Seeing all that I'm GLAD this reddit exists since there's NOTHING better than Americans actually caring about their country that at the same time triggers Libs and cucks.  It's hilarious how there's so many libs coming to a sub just to pointlessly hurt their own feelings and be ultimately powerless to stop or change anything. Love how the mods here have a field day blasting the cucks with facts and reality as well lol.  I will say that, I wish that I had gone to a Trump rally but I was not as confident and comfortable about being out there with my pro MAGA views back then. It didn't completely hit until half way of this year that I was 100% on the MAGA train and not getting off as well as already losing a number of so called friends over it. Hopefully Trump runs again in 2020 because if he does I will most certainly be at as many as I can. Did anyone here go to any of them? I would love to hear people's experiences going to rallies to help me realize what I missed out on since I know I would have made a lot of great friends going to one.  Some news that is very comforting to me is that I've noticed that a lot of libs have been on edge as they do their own research and get tired of the extremism that the left indulges in. They're exposing themselves, falling apart and losing their influence which is a glorious thing to witness. I've also realized how conservative gen Z seems to be. I want that wall built, ALL of the illegals deported and to continue standing strong against out of control third world immigration and Islamic practices that do NOT line up with civilized societies. That's what happens when you push too much as people start to push back. The best part about it is all the whining the powerless libs and cucks will be doing to our amusement over it all.  MAGA for life.     EDIT:  Wow, I did not expect to have the ENORMOUS response that I have gotten from this post. I figured no more than maybe 20 people would chime in and that this post would get buried within minutes never to be seen again. I have one of the most upvoted and active posts here and that's been the case not long after I made it, and it's been an absolutely mind blowing experience. Hundreds of you have chimed in to say nothing but positive and encouraging things save ONE individual that I dealt with and I'm moved beyond words at your overwhelming kindness.   To me, I'm just some random guy sharing his life experiences and POV that should mean nothing to most but you've made me feel like my voice actually matters. I've tried to respond to every comment I could despite how many comments there are because it's the LEAST I can do to show my appreciation for the love you all have given me. Continue to comment or even private message me if you prefer and I will get to them as soon as I can.   I can't thank you all enough for how amazing you've been and you all feel like family to me. A family I never knew I had until now and couldn't be happier to be apart of. Something I NEVER would have knew I had if not for Trump yet Libs say he creates division and brings out hatred in people. Not that Lib delusions will get them to acknowledge it, but the fine people of this thread are yet another nail in the coffin for such ridiculous claims having any merit. Next year if possible, I'll see if I can collect actual Liberal tears in a bottle and send them to Trump hahaha.  I'm glad to hear so many of you had a Merry Christmas (a term Libs hate but I will NOT stop using) and I hope that you all have a VERY happy new year and am excited for yet another year of Trump being our president and making America great.   Team MAGA always!"
"Agenda confirmed, memory holing native Europeans from their own past"
"Twas the night before Q-mas, when all through the house  Not a traitor was stirring, not even the Musk.  The autists were stuck at their keyboards with beer,  In hopes that Q's Infodump soon would be there.  The shills were nestled all snug in their threads,  While visions of Brock's penis danced in their heads.  And Baker in his pastebin, and I in my app,  Had just settled our brains for a long evening’s nap.  When out on the web there arose such a clatter,  I thought SKG could see what was the matter.  Away from the thread I typed like the Flash,  Popped open the browser right from console's bash.  The sound of the voice in the radio snow.  Gave meaning of mission to watchers below.   When, what to my wondering ears should appear,  But an EAM from Andrews I hear.   With hissing and crackle, the bands I skipped through,  I knew in a moment it must be from Q.  More rapid than lightning his signal did came,  And he whistled, and shouted, and called out the same!  ""SKYKING SKYKING DO NOT ANSWER!""  ""TIME 0 0 AUTHORIZATION MIKE NOVEMBER""   ""KILL BILL, I REPEAT, KILL BILL."" the speaker did tout.  ""THIS IS ANDREWS … OUT""  As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,  When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.  So up past the house-tops a Nightwatch did flew,  With a plane full of Operators, and Q was there too.  And then, in a twinkling, I heard in the channel.  The jabbering and laughing and chatting of each of the crew.  As I drew in my head, and was turning around,  Down the chimney Mad Dog did come with a bound.  He was dressed all in cammies, from his foot to his head.  And his clothes were all stained as his enemies had bled.  A bundle of Guns he had flung on his back,  And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.  His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,  And the fear of death put in me had started to show.  The butt of his rifle he held tight in his fist,  smoke from the barrel encircled like a wreath.  He made a stern face and a baleful expression,  I shook when he laughed, he gave that impression!  He was wirey and fit, and ready to kill,  And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of the chill!  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  And loaded all my rifles, then turned with a jerk.  Then laying his finger on the F5 he chose,  And pulling a cable, up the chimney he rose!  He sprang to a Chopper, to his team gave a whistle,  And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.  But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere they flew out of sight,  ""Happy Q-mas to all, and to all a good-night!"""
Just followed two Blocked planes out of Charleston SC to Boca Raton Fl. They were about ten minutes apart. The first one landed and the second just stopped moving before making the final turn for the runway. 1824 FT at 165 Knts.  All the other planes are moving normally but this second blocked plane is about 3-5 miles south west of Boca and dead stopped over a residential area. It must have turned off it's transponders.  Anyone know anything important around Boca Raton? At first I though it was someone important out of Washington when the first plane started dropping altitude and speed as it passed near West Palm Beach.

" Blind Items - The Boys Club  There is a big name out there. A very big name. He can take down a whole lot of people with him. He is a writer and producer and we call him BC. Along with an already shamed A list actor, he was the first to force this A list director to have sex with him for a future in Hollywood.  BC passed that same trait on to the director. BC has several production partners. Each of them are a little piece to the puzzle. Each of them owns a company which is directly involved with other companies that all are mixed and matched with BC and his two partners. One of those projects is a boys club. An actual club similar to a boys and girls club. One where for some reason, girls are not allowed. They only want to help ""boys."" The partner of BC who started this was groomed and shaped by the A list director who is a very frequent guest to the club and a very frequent viewer of the footage from the cameras installed everywhere in the club.  There are estimates that maybe a hundred boys have been molested by this group and their business partners. It could be more. There is another secret player behind all of this and that is an offspring of one of the partners who is also a lawyer. They pay her a lot of money which she spends on partying and she handles all the shell games with the companies  "

"How else do you explain it?  The Trump tax plan got $1000 extra in their pockets!  This is CLEARLY bribery.

"1. Get into congressional power through large inner cities and coastal elite groups.  Count illegal immigrants in census which gives those states more seats in the House.    2. Elect a President (Clinton) by using these electorally large states by invoking emotions of the country instead of presenting actual plans on how to accomplish anything.    3.  Use federal funding to allow almost everyone to go to college and take on student debt.  Southern State school have huge influx in enrollment due to more people being able to afford it/safety take on student loans.  Colleges get Huge, expand rapidly, especially in the South.  4. Ensure the faculty is at least 70% Democrat at each large State school.  ESPECIALLY swing states.  Think teachers union, people that get their PhD’s in random subject like gender studies.    5.  Influence generations of students to hate colonialism, feel personally responsible for Actions of their ancestors, and teach the benefits of socialism in poli sci and history courses.  Preach about Global warming and how all the icecaps will melt by 2014 (Gore) in science classes etc.    6.   Keep this system intact for 20+ years to influence entire generations.    7.  Elites of Southern states start becoming socialists and liberals; taught to hate God and religion; starts breaking families apart.  Starts breaking communities apart.    8. Flood Southern states with Yankees from NYC due to good jobs and cheap property.  Most Democrats start breeding in the South.    9. Over time, train students and the populace at large, through their control of the media and Hollywood, to believe feelings over facts.  Reinforce this idea for decades and push extreme liberal values on everyone via the media.    10. Get Obama elected President.  Push globalist agendas masking as the ‘good feelings’ they have pushed for decades, even when those policies are not in our best interests.  Try to rig another election, candidate passes out and gets chucked into a van like a side of beef.   Lose election to Donald Trump.    11. REeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeE  These are the only reasons, I can see, which would make states like Virginia, NC, Georgia, Florida and Texas swing states.  Texas is in a bit different situation, but you get the idea.  This has been their plan for decades, and it FAILED! They are completely out of ideas.  That’s why all I see is muh Russia and other bullshit stories.  They are out of ideas and the ones they have suck  "

"Whenever I disagree with the classic liberal narrative that they are morally superior to Republicans, I get viciously downvoted and receive many replies. Because of these downvotes, I can't even reply to my accusers because my ""low karma within that subreddit."" I am forced to wait 7 minutes between each reply because of my recent influx or downvotes. Reddit has become the epitome of free speech suppression. The policy of silencing any dissent from their liberal narrative is applied site wide and creates massive echo chambers like r/redacted, r/redactedhumor. Even r/Liberdacted has been over taken by people openly advocating Marxism while claiming to be ""libertarians.""  This website has become everything I despise about American culture in 2017. This website is full of children pretending to be morally superior, when the vast majority of them have never done anything to help others. They justify their selfishness by voting for and promoting politicians that economically oppress the disadvantaged, while claiming to help them. All the while they throw insults and ignorance my way not knowing the actual good deeds I have done to help the disadvantaged.   I live in California, where I am constantly bombarded by the same self righteous opinons while failed politicians are re-elected twenty years later to continue destroying my once wonderful state. They support politicians that make millions in back door deals and move out of the poverty stricken areas they exasperate through crony policies. All while using their own failures to preach the ""evils of capitalism.""  I watch the gentrification of my state continue as politicians claim higher taxes will cause income equality. These same politicians pass the most regressive tax policy I've seen within my lifetime by raising sales tax, property tax, gas tax, cigarette tax etc.  I watch people ignore the success of our economy because of the biased news media which attacks outsiders of the system and protects the most corrupt because they exist within the system which makes them rich. I saw an article today claiming that most people believe we're ""worse off now than before Trump"" even though our gdp growth has hit a 33 year high.  I worked my own way through college and in my senior year, I listened to a girl who never had a job and spent six months traveling Europe lecture me about my White Privilege. (This lecture happened multiple times by very blessed individuals who, you guessed it, never had a job!) I watched people call me racist even though I was bullied throughout k-12 for being white because white people were a minority in my school system. I never held it against a race, only the individuals and continued to hang out with Filipinos, Afghanis, white people, black people, ever race imaginable at lunch time. I was jumped after school while injured from a sports accident by a bunch of racists who always harassed me for being a ""skinny white boy.""  I've watched my Asian friends get screwed out of an education they deserve because of racist policies which barely take important factors like family life and economics into account, while preferring to give admission to people based on skin color. I've watched my fiends go into massive debt while working their way through college while illegal immigrants take the best jobs and best scholarships.  Now I watch as my neighbors are enslaved by the welfare state. Once they are dependent they must vote Democrat to continue receiving the benefits they now need. I am once again called ""immoral"" for advocating self improvement over state dependence. I watch as minority communities are destroyed because the welfare system advocates single parenthood. I watch people pass on jobs because they would make less at minimum wage.  I watch our veterans become homeless and our mentally ill spread disease to one another in my city because they are incentivized to avoid self improvement. I watch our Healthcare system being bankrupted by bad policy and crony capitalism while our veterans can't receive the mental health treatment they need. I watch as our brave military men and women are ostracized and belittled for taking a job I could never handle myself.  I could continue ranting all night, but I need to get back to studying for my masters degree which will be paid for through hard work and dedication. Just know that the self righteous progressives have created another whole hearted shit-posting Trump supporter who will help anyone who is capable of destroying the corrupt scum who put themselves above the future of our country. I am dedicating myself to the mission of not only MAGA, BUT ALSO MCGA. I will fight for my state and my country by spreading logic and utilitarianism, rather than feelings and crony socialist policies.  Thank you for being the only rational echo chamber within this collection echo chambers we call Reddit.

"November 5, 2017–Stephen Willeford was in his home in Sutherland Springs, Texas, when his daughter rushed inside to let him know someone was shooting congregants at the First Baptist Church. Willeford grabbed his AR-15 and a handful of bullets and ran barefoot toward the church in order to confront the killer. Upon arriving, Willeford took a defensive position behind a truck and exchanged fire with the killer, shooting him twice. The killer fled the scene after Willeford shot him, driving roughly 11 miles before taking his own life. Willeford proved anew the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.  The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting or plinking, but protecting our lives and liberty from threats as they arise. The top 25 defensive gun uses of 2017 show that law-abiding Americans understand this and are putting their guns to good use.

"Hey pedes, I'm a canadian, but i've supported and loved trump since the republican primaries. My dad and I would watch the debates and howl with laughter as Trump unloaded on Jeb, little Marco and Lyin (Lion) Ted.   I was recently in NYC and visited Trump tower because i wanted to get a MAGA hat for myself and my dad for christmas (red, white lettering). Unfortunately, i couldn't buy one because FEC rules wont allow non american citizens to purchase campaign items (campaign contributions). You're allowed to purchase non campaign items, but i want authentic.   If anyone knows any way i can get authentic campaign hats that would be amazing. Thanks!"
Has anyone heard anything now that the election is over?

"If Mueller,Comey and the FBI in vegas represent the deep state.. we should make every single agent spent a month with the Mosaad. Im just a guy and i know Hillary has had people killed and committed 30+ thousand felonies with an email server. Let people die in Benghazi. Yet she is free and all i hear is Roy Moore and Mike Flynn. If the current deep state is our best.. maybe at minimum see who the best ones are by playing a game of Clue? "
"We can't imagine losing so much for an entire year and knowing your welfare checks will be taken away, and knowing your Hollywood heroes are most likely rapist. We at T_D are here if you need to talk and the suicide hotlines are always open."
"This is where our country is at.  Michael Flynn is being charged with lying to the FBI during a fake investigation that was started due to HRC/Dems/FBI working with the Russians to overthrow Trump?  Yet, a peice of shit illegal alien, who would not be allowed into any country on earth, is protected at all costs.  Keep in mind, if you shoot someone, just say ""i didnt mean to!"".  If you have a stolen weapon, just say ""i found it!"".  "

"It seems like the center right voters did not turn out for Roy Moore.   Every election that Shelby and Sessions won, their turnout was at least 750,000. Off by about 110,000-130,000 votes depending on the final result. It seems like President Trump was right in supporting the more moderate Republican candidate in Luther Strange. "

inb4 concern troll    blasting on the local radio has been Bannon's words regarding Romney and his entire family and DNA. Why ? What did this serve? Why even bring up his non political family and his genome?    Bannon got ahead of himself and gave an excuse for Utah GOP members to defend him on a personal level while avoiding politics.    Romney is not going to be a national candidate again. His sights are set in Utah.
Just amazing to think about.

"And even then, Flynn only lied to Peter Strzok because he didn't want to contradict VP-elect Pence's statements in MSM interviews.  It's almost like the Trump administration is being transparent and there isn't any collusion, or something.  Imagine my shock."

Russia went so far with the renew the cold war threats that it caused the US to go all the way to DEFCON 3. It happened right after Hillary was using the Russia to deflect the Wikileak releases. It scared a lot of people when combined with all the anti-russian rhetoric coming out of the Hillary campaign, and enabled Trump allied groups to paint Hillary as someone that will start a new cold war. (remember the ""draft our daughters"" meme /r/the_donald was able the spread because of this)  It seems pretty clear to me that the nuclear stuff from Russia was meant to influence the US election, (the alternative is that Putin thinks that the US will nuke them for alleged hacking that just doesn't past the sniff test), and it definitely is a lot more effective than the ""troll farm"" story that the MSM was peddling a few week ago, so why is no one talking about this?

I need some advice from my fellow Pedes though. I still love my ex, despite all the madness that’s ensued since she quit taking her medicine once she learned that she was pregnant, because I understand that she didn’t want her psychological medicine to affect our daughter. My question is: would any of you continue to chase after your ex after she tried to steal your child from you? On our first court date, our lawyers were both late, and I saw her standing alone in the courthouse...and it broke my heart. I’d been with her for two years while we were together, and I saw the pain she went through with her ex husband. I saw her heartache when he wouldn’t allow her to see her son because he’s a manipulative asshole. Am I crazy to hold out hope that someday we might have our happily ever after?

"This supposition requires you have paid attention the last year and know some basic facts about this situation.  --- **Hillary's Blackberry Crew =&gt; the Awan Brotherhood**  Firstly, you have to know that the people in Congress, as well as HRC's intimates carried Blackberries.  You also have to know that Hillary eschewed an NSA phone which is a 5000 dollar secured, hardened device they wanted her to use.  She said no, and pushed back hard.  Princess got her way, and was able to use blackberry phones. Not only that, she communicated to others via blackberry and was allowed to bring them into the SCIF--imagine that: secure compartmentalized booths that are specifically designed so no unwanted communications can be spirited out of them--and she's allowed to bring her own little personal recording / surveillance device in with her.  Open investigation information is giving evidence that Imran Awan, et al, were doping blackberries with additional software in Pakistan and then bringing those back to the US to give to Congressmen and to Hillary's campaign acolytes.  There is a famous email having Abedin tell ""Weiner's special staff"" to bring a doped blackberry to NY.  We believe that is Rao Abbas, one of Imran's associates.  --- **What is BES-Blackberry Enterprise Server?**  So blackberries are a special device that allow a person to create a private, secure, mobile, wireless communication network because of their superior abilities.  One could call this a 'private blackberry cloud'. This network is managed through Blackberry Enterprise Server or BES.  What BES lets you do is run a private email server, private text messages, private filesharing, etc; and it allows you to flag people's blackberry accounts so that those people have a set of permissions to access various resources on the BES.  What this effectively means is that whomever is controlling that Blackberry Enterprise Server can control what individual users of the BES can 'see' or 'access'--this is the perfect way to compartmentalize and give differential information to different people, presumably based on the level of trust that the manager of BES would have.  Effectively, this means Blackberry Enterprise Server when properly configured, would act as a private, off-brand CIA, because it could control the visibility of information in exactly the same way that the CIA works, with various BES flags acting as different security clearances such as TOP SECRET, Q,  PLATINUMINVESTOR, SPACELORD, GALACTICMASON etc  --- **Gateway Pundit List and its Verification**  I reported here 3 months ago about [GP's equipment list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6vvdiq/gatewaypundit_lists_equipment_confiscated_from/).  Many distrusted this, and rightly so, after all it was just way too easy and [too damaging to be true](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/21my.png)--it must be fakenews.  Even though GP is actually fairly trustworthy site of the Alt-right (libertarian/maga bent).  Btw, pedes, really great comments on that post.  I believe this equipment list has been confirmed by whistleblowers in the intelligence community as reported--if I recall correctly--by Thomas Paine of True Pundit.  Correct me if I'm wrong that it was him.  It could also be confirmed from George Webb's Deep Blackberry, Kallstrom, Boyce, or ""Task Force"".  I searched the transcripts just really quickly and couldn't find the confirming person but it could be something I heard on Crowdsource the Truth as well.  --- **Finally, the Evidence**  Wikileaks Email from 2011|2016 interview w/Strzok :--:|:--: From: Cheryl Mills // To: Hillary Clinton // Date: 2011-12-03 23:28 // ... [at the very bottom] [***Sent Using U.S. Department of State / Blackberry Server***](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5814)--Screenshot [of PDF is here](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/21n1.png)|[TheDuran Reports,](http://theduran.com/fbi-agent-let-cheryl-mills-and-huma-abedin-walk-away-scot-free-after-lying-to-fbi/) *“Mills did not learn Clinton was using a private server until*  [***after Clinton’s [Department of State] tenure,”*** [screenshot]](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/21n3.png) *reads notes from Mills’ April 9, 2016 interview. “Mills stated she was not even sure she knew what a server was at the time.”*  Cheryl Mills not only ***sent this email herself (as a FWD from another)***, she also SAW that [FWD email FIVE TIMES the day before.](https://twitter.com/911bodysnatcher/status/938413491815419904)  For her to say she did not see this ""State Dept / Blackberry Server"" would be impossible.  She herself HAD a blackberry during this time.  We know she did from the famous 7th floor FBI documents naming her in the secretive group of the State Dept, along with Obama and Clinton, the 2 other people who have been caught using the private server.  I don't think this is a nothingburger, and here's why.  If it was not-redacted in the wikileaks email, it *could* mean that someone missed it in redacting it, or that it was meant to be seen by the public eventually (if it's true wikileaks is really just us intelligence's white hat 'confessor' watchdog group); or it could (MUCH MORE LIKELY) that this State Dept Blackberry server was 'official' because HRC made it so.  That would make it both HRC's private server AND public server--she officialized it.  In other words, it was state sanctioned blackberry server.  Which could mean it was all above board...except for the fact that if it was her own server it was privatized within the public government, a no no--that's HRC hiding stuff from the NSA, CIA, etc.  Now here's the important part--and this is key--if that BES server is the SAME server that was taken by Capitol Police and listed on Gateway Pundit, then Hillary Clinton is fucked, so is the Capitol police, so is Andrew McCabe, and so are the Awans, and SO, so, so many others  Including Cheryl Mills. And Huma Abedin.  So I've recommended to George Webb that he [include this server in discovery in his lawsuit](https://twitter.com/911bodysnatcher/status/938414130993795072), that he task others to find out which server this email came from, and try to match the serial numbers.

First of all, [here's the full Flynn file from Mueller.](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015126/download)   He's guilty of lying to the FBI about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador during **DECEMBER 2016**, which was **AFTER THE ELECTION**, during the transition.  There's point #1.  No election collusion.   ***   Second point, [**OBAMA'S ADMIN APPROVED OF THE CALLS**](https://i.redd.it/jpri7xnebe101.png).   So the Logan Act was not violated.   ***   Third point, there is literally nothing wrong with the transition team holding conferences with foreign powers to get a jump start on their foreign policy during the transition period.  [Obama's guy was literally in Moscow during his transition after the 2008 election.](https://i.imgur.com/1whJtIf.jpg)   ***   Fourth point:  if Flynn was actually going to reveal some sort of plot to collude during the election, he'd be pleading guilty to an unspecified scheme, not a single count of lying to the FBI, which is not that serious.   ***   **BUT WHY DID HE LIE?**   Theory:  We know that Flynn failed to register as a foreign agent for Turkey, and that he lied about the stuff in Mueller's file to Pence.  Pence was made to look like a fool because as head of the transition team he unknowingly brought on an unregistered agent for Turkey.  Pence got really pissed and pressured Trump to fire Flynn, which you all should remember from a long time ago.  Flynn lied to the FBI because, not knowing his calls had been illegally unmasked by Susan Rice, he was scared of the FBI examining his phone records and revealing his corrupt Turkish ties and failure to register as a foreign agent.

"Consider the fact that San Francisco is rejoicing because they successfully exonerated a 5-times deported felonious illegal alien who murdered a beautiful young American. I'm not hearing any associations, companies, businesses, or anything else canceling events or conventions or threatening to leave to protest SF's lunacy.  But I sure remember when Mike Pence (as governor of Indiana) signed a bill into law that said religious business owners couldn't be forced to do things that were contrary to their religious beliefs...the stampede of virtue-signaling asswipes nationwide screeched and protested and boycotted and canceled and threatened this state until Pence finally backed down and agreed to keep forcing religious people to do things that run counter to their beliefs.  I just don't get how a nation of 300+ million people think what Pence did was somehow worse than what San Francisco did. And until that changes, we have no hope of returning sanity to this country.  Personally I have no desire to ever travel to any state filled with so many radical alt-left lunatics who clearly value the lives of illegal Mexicans more than they do innocent Americans.  And until we somehow manage to force the dumbasses in Congress to pass e-verify with STRICT penalties for employing illegals and BUILD A WALL, we will unfortunately have more disgusting stories like this one. Hell, they won't even write a proposed amendment into this tax bill that would prohibit American companies from claiming a tax deduction for the illegals they pay. Fat chance they will EVER do their jobs and put America first."

"In 2015 I remember my family and heading to see one of our friend's at this restaurant she worked for, she told us about how excited she was to see her best friend up in San Francisco and how she was going to have brunch with her. Shortly before she headed up she received a phone call about what had happened with Kate and she was absolutely devastated that her close childhood friend was taken away from her especially with Kate's whole life ahead of her. After this day, I remembered feeling so angry that our country failed to protect one of its citizens. Today I can't even imagine what she must be going through and I'm absolutely appalled by the verdict. This is the reason I voted for Trump and I from personal experience am in shock when people defend illegal aliens, even when they've taken a fellow American's life. BUILD THAT WALL!"

"**EVENT NUMBER 1**  a. On or about December 28, 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13757, which was to take effect the following day. The executive order announced sanctions against Russia in response to that government's actions intended to interfere with the 2016 presidential election (""U.S. Sanctions"").  b. On or about December 28, 2016, the Russian Ambassador contacted FLYNN.  c. On or about December 29, 2016, FLYNN called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (""PTT official""), who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions. On that call, FLYNN and the PIT official discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals. The PTT official and FLYNN also discussed that the members of the Presidential Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation.  d. Immediately after his phone call with the PIT official, FLYNN called the Russian Ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. Sanctions in a reciprocal manner.  e. Shortly after his phone call with the Russian Ambassador, FLYNN spoke with the PIT official to report on the substance of his call with the Russian Ambassador, including their discussion of the U.S. Sanctions.  f. On or about December 30, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin released a statement indicating that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the U.S. Sanctions at that time.  g. On or about December 31, 2016, the Russian Ambassador called FLYNN and informed him that Russia had chosen not to retaliate in response to FL YNN's request.  h. After his phone call with the Russian Ambassador, FLYNN spoke with senior members of the Presidential Transition Team about FL YNN's conversations with the Russian Ambassador regarding the U.S. Sanctions and Russia's decision not to escalate the situation.  **EVENT NUMBER 2**  a. On or about December 21, 2016, Egypt submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security Council on the issue of Israeli settlements (""resolution""). The United Nations Security Council was scheduled to vote on the resolution the following day.  b. On or about December 22, 2016, a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team directed FLYNN to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.  c. On or about December 22, 2016, FLYNN contacted the Russian Ambassador about the pending vote. FLYNN informed the Russian Ambassador about the incoming administration's opposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution.  d. On or about December 23, 2016, FLYNN again spoke with the Russian Ambassador, who informed FLYNN that if it came to a vote Russia would not vote against the resolution.

This was the most important bill on Trump's agenda
By all accounts Michael Flynn contacted Russia during the transition purely to stop Russia from imposing sanctions on the USA . He didnt undercut Obamas sanctions on Russia which he didnt have the power to do. He simply saved America from harmful sanctions. How is that bad?   Edit: HHHUUUGGGEEEE! In official press breifing Obama state department specifically stated they had no problem with Flynn or anyone on the transition team contacting russia or anyone else and would even help them do it if asked.

"[Luke 2:1-7 KJV] And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)   And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.   And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."

"Under the plan that PotUS proposed, my family would have kept $3500-$4000 more of our own money.  Under the House or Senate bill, it is only $300-$500 more... around one tenth of what PotUS plan would have provided for the middle class.  It would be tough for PotUS not to pass this bill because then it would be said that he is ""vetoing tax cuts""... which would technically be true.  Anyway I am not trying to ""concern troll""... I am simply reminding pedes...  DO NOT BE FOOLED.  The swamp hasn't changed.  RINOs haven't changed.  Never Trumpers have not changed. t  If we want to feel the full force of PotUS' plan to help ""the forgotten men and women"" of America's middle class... WE MUST stay focused on replacing RINOs with real MAGA folks.  spez:  I forgot to bring up / mention that PotUS original plan also had a generous 0% bracket... it was something like $25k for single $37k for head of household and $50k for married... so taxable income up that amount would be 0%.  Then it went up upward at the marginal rates.  It was just a higher 0% bracket.  That also makes a massive difference in terms of what middle class families will keep compared to the GOPs bill."

Ask me how?
"This is what someone told me today:  ""His political opinions are indicative that he cares about people outside himself, a trait exemplified by this story, and one that conservatives don't seem to get.""  What does that mean, that we don't seem to get? We don't get how to care about people outside ourselves? I don't know a single conservative, myself included, that doesn't care about their family and their friends. So what is this implying - that we don't give enough tax money to complete strangers? I'm sorry but maybe I'm a dick and an asshole but I don't WANT to give money that *I* earned to people I don't know that don't mean anything to me *and* didn't earn a single cent of *my* money. Why should I? I'm sorry I simply can't afford to. And to be honest I hate illegals so much that if my tax money went to them it would feel the same as of a jew's tax money went to help nazis.   And they always attack rich/successful people for their taxes too. WHY do they want rich/successful people to pay SO much more? People always tell you growing up, ""Go for your dreams! You can do anything! Go for the American dream of being wealthy and successful!"" then when you achieve it they go ""FUCK YOU GIVE US ALL YOUR MONEY!"" ""Pay us your fair share!""  Their ""fair"" share. Well if we're talking about fair then tell me this: how is it fair that one person pays $1 of their taxes to a local stop light or $1 for a local fire department but another person will have to pay $100 for the same stop light or fire department? Especially when that person likely employs many people who also pay taxes, and their company makes a product that generates sales taxes too. "

During our relationship, I found myself easing off and trying to accept her views, but ultimately I couldn't. One big thing that we disagreed on was Trump, she had a strong opinion about him. Said he was sexist and fucked up. We argued over that. We also argued over the transgender thing. I basically don't care about people and their freewill, but if I have a son or a daughter, they'll be raised according to his/her biological sex. She also thought the idea of illegal immigration and having a wall was a stupid and xenophobic idea.

Now in the coming days when Dems are indicted, the left media will have no choice but to condemn them like they have condemned Flynn.

"The Birth of Jesus (the Gospel of Luke, Ch. 2):  In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world (this was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria). And everyone went to their own town to register.  So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.  And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today, in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord! This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”  Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,  “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”"

This line is my favorite part from this piece of crap op/ed:  http://archive.is/uzZAL   
"I thought that the amoral left had finally found that they had a conscience. Ridding themselves of all their lady harassing scumbags but I was wrong... Never mind. It was all just a political ploy to attack President Trump.  They have not only tolerated their serial abuser icons, they have loved them and adored them: Bill Clinton, JFK, and Teddy Kennedy  Once the Dems were the party of racist and the Klan. With a little help from the MSM they passed that stigma over to the Republicans. The did the same with the Vietnam war, which began under Kennedy and escalated on Johnson after his false Gulf of Tonkin attack. Now they are trying to do the same with sex harassment. We cannot let them win this one.  From the liberal rag, The Nation:  Now That Al Franken Is Gone, Democrats Need to Hold Hearings on Trump |  They have the moral high ground; now they need to use it to create real accountability for both parties. By Joan Walsh  ...Now that Franken has left the building, why can’t the Democratic senators who’ve asked him to resign—an astonishing 35 out of 48 caucus members—now commit to holding hearings on Trump’s many sexual-abuse accusations? A Quinnipiac poll out Wednesday shows that 70 percent of Americans polled say they want Congress to investigate the allegations against Trump; only 25 percent are opposed. Given that Trump’s pathetic approval ratings normally show him with the backing of 35 to 40 percent of those polled, this means a significant number of Trump supporters also want these charges investigated. ... It will not force GOP leaders to concede that Democrats have integrity when it comes to these claims, and that Republicans don’t. As Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick explains, that’s because “Republicans have built an unlevel playing field of morality.” Remember: Serial prevaricator Sarah Huckabee Sanders has already explained that the difference between Franken and Trump is that Franken admitted something happened, and apologized, while Trump denied all the charges against him. ... https://www.thenation.com/article/now-that-al-franken-is-gone-democrats-need-to-hold-hearings-on-trump/"
So fuck em!
"Make it seem like you are a supporter and emphasize how unfair it is that these guys are getting railroaded just to attempt an attack on Trump.  The right message might make them want a little payback on the way out.  I know that the new Franken accusers are just there to set the burden of proof super low so they can hit Moore and Trump.  That has to piss him off.  He'd skate by fine with photographic evidence of his harassment, but these new unprovable ones are the ones that are taking him down with the help of his own party.  Conyers said he'd leak to get back at the democrats, so it isn't a stretch to think others might.  "

"FBI investigator Peter Strzok not only let Hillary Clinton off the hook, he may have used Democratic Party opposition research as an excuse to spy on Trump campaign advisers.  Strzok became such a political liability that special counsel Robert Mueller had to boot him off the Russia case, where he worked for nearly three months. Mueller made the move after the Justice Department’s inspector general pointed out text messages Strzok sent to a mistress, who also worked for Mueller, exhibiting a strong anti-Trump, pro-Clinton bias.  His misconduct has sent shock waves through Washington because in July 2016, just days after closing the Clinton email case he led, Strzok signed the document that opened the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. His fingerprints are all over both cases, one widely criticized as a whitewash and the other condemned by the president and many in his party as a witch hunt.  –– ADVERTISEMENT ––  Potentially more disturbing is Strzok’s possible role in what many see as an even bigger scandal: the weaponizing of US intelligence against political opponents. Did he also sign documents asking a federal court to allow the FBI to spy on Trump advisers? It’s a critical question, because a so-called FISA document authorizing agents to monitor the communications of Trump adviser Carter Page, for one, reportedly was based at least in part on anti-Trump Russia propaganda promulgated in a dossier underwritten by the Clinton campaign — a partisan smear sheet that the FBI and Mueller have nonetheless used as a road map in their Russia probe.  In a Post interview, Page said he suspects Strzok, as the FBI’s No. 2 counterintelligence official, was also involved in applying for and obtaining the secret surveillance warrant on Page from the FISA court in September 2016. He adds that it’s “really interesting” that the dirty dossier found its way into Strzok’s orbit around the same time.  Indeed, according to an in-depth New York Times retrospective published earlier this year detailing the FBI’s two campaign investigations, Clinton subcontractor Christopher Steele briefed the FBI leadership about the findings in his now-discredited dossier in August 2016. Weeks later, the information landed “with Mr. Strzok and his team.”  “In late September, Mr. Steele heard back from his contact at the FBI,” the article continued. “The agency wanted to see the material he had collected ‘right away,’ ” while offering to pay him $50,000.  That month, a monitor was placed on Page.  Both the Senate and House are seeking the bureau’s FISA affidavits to determine to what extent they relied on the dirty Clinton dossier. But the FBI is stonewalling their requests. It’s also blocking FOIA requests by Page, who last month denied the dossier’s charges under oath, calling them politically motivated.  The FBI didn’t just target Page. It also targeted other Trump advisers. In fact, Strzok personally grilled Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn about his Russian ties at the White House just days after Flynn took office.  Last week, Mueller filed charges against Flynn for lying to Strzok about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.  Strzok monitored intercepts of the Russian Embassy and already knew what Flynn and the Russian ambassador had discussed. So why did he need to ask him about what he already knew? Was he trying to trap him in a lie? Also, who leaked the intercepts to the press?  Strzok led the sham investigation of Clinton’s emails from start to finish, and helped draft her exoneration months in advance of her July 2, 2016, interview, which he personally supervised. He was the agent responsible for softening language then-FBI Director James Comey used in his July 5, 2016, statement clearing Clinton just ahead of the Democratic convention. He changed the rough draft of Comey’s announcement describing Clinton’s behavior as “grossly negligent” (a possible crime) to “extremely careless.” Strzok also was involved in the review of State Department emails discovered on Anthony Weiner’s laptop and gave Clinton her second pass just before the election.  The fix was in, and the fixer appears to have been a top G-man who, behind the scenes, sang the praises of the Democratic subject of his investigation and mocked the Republican subject of his other investigation.  Regardless of what you think about Trump, the Deep State — that is, the federal police and intelligence — shouldn’t get to pick and choose the leadership of this country. We are better than Thailand. If they are not held accountable, they will do it again."
A lot of wasted energy on these shenanigans.  Why not just get rid of Mueller and move on?  Trump is in power to get legislation and other such executive things done.  Not deal with shenanigans.

CNN is reporting that the Trump campaign in 2016 apparently refused a request for help from a Nigerian Prince in a deep financial turmoil. This refusal of foreign aid to the deeply troubled African country only proves what an absolute racist Donald Trump is!  The Nigerian Official reportedly sent the Trump campaign a desperate plea for help via his only means of communication which was E-mail. This desperate plea for help on behalf of his country and his people was summarily filtered to the SPAM folder on the Trump Campaign E-mail server in a callous act of indifference!  The Trump campaign claims it DIDN'T EVEN KNOW about the E-mail that was sent to them!

"Consider a scenario where you cannot sleep in your bedroom because your neighbors don’t think you should have that right and have threatened to kill you if you do.  For months now you’ve been forbidden to sleep there despite some nicer neighbors saying they’ll stick up for you. This entire time the bad neighbors have been throwing rocks through your windows to intimidate you.  Now, suddenly your nicest neighbor comes back from being out of town and tells you that it is YOUR bedroom so YOU should be allowed to sleep there. In fact, the nicest neighbor will sit in a chair next to the door so the violent neighbors will be deterred from interfering.  So you start to enter YOUR bedroom, when suddenly the entire neighborhood (that’s been looking through the window) starts screaming at you that you either a) don’t have the right to your own bedroom or b) the violent neighbors will do more violent things if you go in there.   What do you do?  A) Blame the nicest neighbor for trying to help you  B) Bake apology banana cake (halal) for the neighborhood  C) Cry and go to the living room and watch your wife’s boyfriend’s son rape your daughter  D) Enter your bedroom and go the fuck to sleep"

"Because we don't try to BULLSHIT our way around issues and try to make it look like this when REALLY it's like THIS.  It's a classic theme, the truth always comes out.  That why when people are hating on Trump or whatever it always bites em in the ass because they don't want to look at whatever situation they're bitching about in a realistic manner, and then they try to color it through their emotions, and then later on down the road they get slapped in the face.  Also Pepe is watching"
"Think of it, almost immediately after Flynn was charged we got this: 1st they released a fake Deutsche Bank story (to try and cross Trump's ""red line"" on investigating personal/family finances), then they started releasing news of anti-Trump investigation members, then they started releasing names of Mueller investigators that worked on past investigations like the Hillary e-mail scandal. Then we hear about the FBI ""stonewalling"" congress and talk of possible 'contempt charges'. Then Alec Baldwin (Trump impersonator) releases some video trying to ""stop Trump from firing Mueller"" in some bizarre attempt at reverse psychology on Trump.     They're doing this because:      A) So they don't have to continue the mandate of the investigation and look into Hillary's campaign...    B) So they can leave people thinking that Trump fired them because they were 'getting too close to the truth'...    C) To explain why their investigation turned up nothing... 'we were stopped from doing the full job'.     D) Maybe if they have their investigation terminated they will no longer have an IG and Congressional oversight looking into their sham investigation.    Don't buy into their ploy, make them finish out their sham investigation. "

After crying for over an hour, I finally mustered up the nerve to capture, and eat the cat.   &amp;nbsp;  **It did not go as planned.**  &amp;nbsp;  A blind fury of fur and claws overwhelmed me. I tried to protect myself as best I could with whatever I could grab.   My signed copy of ""What Happened"" is now confetti, the spatula broke in half, and my makeshift hazmat suit now has more holes in it than Shepard Smith.... and to top it all off, *the cat is now nowhere to be found*.  &amp;nbsp;  After bandaging my wounds with dirty socks and shoelaces, I sulked and thought all hope was lost.   &amp;nbsp;  Later, my fortune took a turn for the better when I unexpectedly found an unopened box of Twinkies in the back of one of my desk drawers (Luckily, they have no expiration date).  I will need to ration them as I do not know how long it will be before another source of food can be found.  &amp;nbsp;  *End of entry.*  &amp;nbsp;  P.S. I managed to get the new signs up in the yard (just in the nick of time). Someone wearing a red hat walked by the house just after I finished. Peering out from the basement hopper window, I could see they stopped for a moment, shook their head, and continued walking. *Whew! That was a close one.*  &amp;nbsp;  P.P.S.

(I think it knows what I am planning)  &amp;nbsp;  Today I ventured outside wearing my makeshift hazmat suit. It held up pretty well, but do not know how much protection it is actually providing.   &amp;nbsp;  The world is now a horrific and unrecognisable wasteland.   &amp;nbsp;  I stumbled across a group of survivors and remembered to sing the song of my people ""*Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*"" to demonstrate that I am not a threat. They pointed and laughed at me. It was humiliating and frightening.  &amp;nbsp;  My parent's basement never felt more safe.  &amp;nbsp;  In my travels, I did manage to scrounge up two new sharpies, and some undamaged poster-board. I will fashion some new yard signs in an attempt to ward off any further hurt feelings.  Some sign ideas:  * ""Fuck Drumpf!"" * ""I don't understand economics"" * ""Potato""  Hopefully they will offer some protection against the evil reality I now live in.  &amp;nbsp;  *Thank you Diary for being there when I need you.*  &amp;nbsp;  ---  ---  &amp;nbsp;  [**12-27-17**](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7mgr87/day_13/)  &amp;nbsp;  Dear Diary,  It has been 13 days since the F.C.C. repealed Net Neutrality.  &amp;nbsp;  I ran out of Doritos and Mountain Dew two days ago, and am seriously thinking about eating the cat.  &amp;nbsp;  Before the end-times, my parents tried to make me leave the house when I was 34, but I kept holding out for a management job. It is very fortunate because I could have actually been at work when the end of the world came.  (No matter what those loser Trump supporters say, living in your parent's basement does have its benefits)  &amp;nbsp;  Thinking about venturing outside tomorrow.   I fashioned a makeshift hazmat suit out of a shower-cap, an old raincoat, and duct tape. I hope it provides enough protection.

"&gt;""According to figures from the State Department, Muslim refugee flows fell 94 percent from January to November 2017 (the last full month of available data). In calendar 2016, the United States admitted almost 45,000 Muslim refugees, compared to a little more than 11,000 in 2017—fully half of those entered in January and February. Of course, the administration has cut refugee flows generally, but the Muslim share of all refugees has dropped substantially too—from 50 percent in January to less than 10 percent in November.""   "

"“He lined us up, and I thought this was going to be like a meet and greet, like ‘hi, how are ya, nice to meet you,’ it was not,” Holvey said on NBC. “He was just looking me over like I was a piece of meat, I was not a human being, I didn’t have a brain, I didn’t have a personality. I was just simply there for his pleasure. It left me feeling very gross, very dirty. This is not what I signed up for.”  By ""signed up for"", she means, of course, being a CONTESTANT IN A BEAUTY PAGEANT and thus, being subject to Trumps scrutiny. Nobody made her do it, but she was getting paid to get stared at, and she thinks its now some sort of evidence of perversion or even a crime? lool.  This, among other such outright horseshit, is justification for a congressional probe?  This is what moonbats would call a sexual assault?  Like the picture clearly depicting Al Frankengroper doin his thing?  Or the payoffs with taxpayer money(!!!!) to Conyer's victims?  Thats feminism right there. In a nutshell.  This delusional bullshit it what we're up against.  Also, wasn't Plane Lady, the broad who said she was on a plane in the 70's when Trump supposedly groped her, wasn't her story debunked with the plane records or some such?  And what the fuck does it take, exactly, to get your license to practice law revoked?  Gloria Allred is the equivalent of a feminist ambulance chaser. She's a total hack, and yet, time after time, she's there in the spotlight, and more likely then not, her ""case"" is a frivolous manila of thin, if not outright empty, air.  Trump should sue these accusers for libel and slander and have the DOJ pull Allreds law license.   "

Enough of the social media platforms with a political bubble. It's time to bring back social media, it's time to bring back it's roots. It's time to bring back the platform of MySpace, sharing and archiving smiling faces, energetic photos and a look into what makes this country great.   Not only that, but could you imagine if we collapse Facebook?? It would send a huge message to Cuckerberg and the globalists. CENSORSHIP will not be tolerated and censorship will not make your company thrive and last. Send a message to Cuckerberg showing what he's going against before he runs for president. TAKE DOWN FACEBOOK. TAKE DOWN CUCKERBERG.  LET""S MAKE MYPSACE GREAT AGAIN!!! Let's go back to sharing photos showing the joy in this country. Let's go back to connecting with people.

"Human nature psychology and opinion does not shift fast enough to love a person and then hate a person instantly without a major catalyst such as a proven deliberate charge of a crime.    Lie detecting is easy and the opportunity to spot it happens to everyone frequently in life.   In relationships, wives/husbands, girlfriends/boyfriends, you begin to learn if your significant other is being deceitful if they over explain or over embellish situations that they don’t have a direct and swift answer to.  This is natural as while people do things that are wrong they don’t want to admit it and try to suppress until it leaves the others mind.    But if the other side fights back and asks questions with persistence then the story often begins to slowly fall apart and the truth emerges.  The same thing is happening now with the media but moving fast into the government as well."
"Holy shit. The FCC came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken tendies and I literally screamed at it and hit the plate of tendies out of it's hand.

I didn’t mean to do that to the FCC but I’m literally in shock from their decision. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why do I keep losing? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown. I want to believe the world is corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I wanted Bernie to be president and fix my shitty internet service. I cannot fucking deal with this right now.

"It's been confirmed that the guy who sent the negative Trump texts also lead the investigation into Hillary, altered James Comey's report to be more favorable towards her, questioned Huma Abadeen (interesting, she clearly lied, because he interviewed her BEFORE the emails were found on her computer, but never went back after her), and was the one who interviewed General Flynn, and subsequently got the general in trouble for lying.  Another person on the team defended the Clinton foundation against a lawsuit, and paid several thousands to Hillary's campaign.  Others on the team paid over $60k combined, and it just came out recently that yet *another* member of the investigation team was at Hillary's election night party.   This investigation is so obviously biased against Trump that it needs to be closed at once.     Also, am I missing anyone or anything? Knowing how corrupt Democrats are, it wouldn't surprise me if more people are involved.    "

I saw a post on imgur earlier today talking about how Elon Musk wants to set up his own ISP to provide global High Speed internet that has Net Neutrality. Not even a week after the repeal of NN the free market is already proving that it can handle a world without government regulation. Imgur is very left leaning. Ever since the announcement the FCC would vote they've been shilling for NN daily. And when it passed they had a meltdown. But now they're back to their normal shilling selves and are sucking ol'Musky off at another one of his venture ideas. (He wants to provide satellite internet so I hope anyone that signs up enjoys no internet on rainy days)
"Where did 800,000 votes go? How does a Democrat win a deep red Republican state? A state that also leaned Trump in 2016?  Why did Moore's accuser wait until 3 weeks before election to go for Moore? Why did she go through the press and not police first? Why did she not ask for a different judge when Moore was the judge for her divorce? How is it not a red flag that she works for Doug Jones?  Why didn't Allred give analysts a chance to examine her evidence on Moore? "

"By all parroting the same lies about Americans, the news media uses political and psychological manipulation to make the overwhelming millions of Trump voters feel isolated or out of the mainstream.    Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are the backbone of this country and our candidate won in a lopsided victory.    You know who should feel isolated?  Liberal elites in their tiny islands of thought bubbles along the coasts.  They do not represent America.  We reject their lies, hypocrisy, condescension,  and corruption.    Their attempts to place our duly elected president on the defensive are pathetic and weak.    The media is a small group of liars trying to brainwash you into abandoning your common sense and values.    We are America and Trump is our president.  Be proud of both!"
"I posted the following comment on the Guardian: 'Senator Gillibrand taking money from Trump isn't prostitution. It's common practice for politicians to take money from wealthy donors. It's a win win, the politician gets money to run a campaign and the donor gets influence if the politician gets elected'  I received a lot of responses calling this kind of behavior prostitution.  That was fun"
"Hi, I helped promote a synchronized mass meditation/prayer to pray for arrests of DC pedophiles earlier this year in March, and I feel guided in my heart to start a series of 4 weekly synchronized mass meditations/prayers on consecutive Saturdays to pray for justice, healing, empowerment, and support of all those who have been sexually abused in Hollywood, DC, and elsewhere. My focus is rape of adults and especially of children. This fourth and last synchronized meditation/prayer will happen tomorrow, Saturday, December 9th at 1:11 pm- 1:33 pm (22 minutes) EST (10:11 am PST). Visualize the criminals being arrested leading to fair and public trials and send light and love to those who have been hurt by sexual abuse and human trafficking. Let's pray for the safety and empowerment of whistleblowers too. The intention should not be for revenge but for saving the children and the healing of humanity.  If you are unsure about the effect of mass meditations (also known as Maharishi effect):  http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/washington_crime_prevention_full_article.html  Please spread this message!   Below is a great meditation to do at that time, created by Meditate Change:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzzO31n72Bo&amp;t=1s"

"The tax bill's goal is to increase middle class tax home pay. It does it by : increasing standard deduction, lower middleclass income tax rate, bringing more company jobs back to america causing eventual worker scarcity and competitive wage hikes,  eliminating the huge Obamacare non health insurance monthly costs starting in 2019. Take home pay will drastically rise in one year."
"Yesterday, I posted my first post to this subreddit. I stated that I am a slightly right leaning centrist. I went into detail about trumps twitter (more so the salty libtards that tweet snipe him and how that’s only hurting them in the long run) [(you can view it here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7ki9y3/from_a_more_centrist_pov/?st=JBCTW5FX&amp;sh=7586a892)  Today, I would like to just bring more attention to the “social media jailing” that has been going around. It seems that no matter what you say, even if it is truth backed by factual evidence, if you are a conservative that posts something “threatening” (threatening to the Democratic Party, not to an individual) you get put into (insert social media platform here) jail. It almost feels like they throw any form of free speech from a conservative out the window and put them into a gulag (fitting, since they are autismo-communists).  You will see all over the internet libtards saying un-factual actual threatening to someone’s life (or just hurtful, but I don’t think anyone here gets offended as easily as the libtards) stuff on social media without holding back to a conservative. Thy will usually get applauded for it. But the minute a conservative says a  factual statement with strong evidence to support it (or just reports news about antifa) the left who run these social media platforms (this includes YouTube) infringe on the right’s constitutional first amendment right by silencing them or just banning them all together. Like I said, the social media gulag. Now, a quick side note: When I see a right winged youtuber report about how their video got taken off of YouTube or demonetized, (their video showing antifa being violent as always), it is almost always immediately put back because it was taken off by some “mistake.” It makes me wonder, if the left is somewhat embarrassed that they cannot hawk their little communists under control long enough before they are caught red handed doing what can only be described as “we wuz commies and shiet”, or they are just hiding it from the left to keep them brainwashed (cause let’s face it, that’s the only way the Democratic Party is still standing. Brainwashing minorities and making whites feel like they must go and whip themselves in the street to show how sorry they are that their own people sold them to the whites in the first place).   TL;DR: everyday, as a centrist, I feel myself sliding further and further to the right; and it doesn’t feel bad (at least not as bad as it would sliding to the left). "

"[Matthew 2:12-15 KJV] And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.   And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:   And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son."

“A nation without borders is not a nation.   A nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot protect its interests abroad.   A nation that is not prepared to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war.  A nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident in its future.  And a nation that is not certain of its values cannot summon the will to defend them.” From the speech today”

"[Luke 3:15-20 NLT] Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah.   John answered their questions by saying, “I baptize you with water; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”   John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people. John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, for marrying Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for many other wrongs he had done. So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others."

"Regardless of what you think, we're all fighting against the GOPe.  Trump was our ""F*** YOU"" to the GOPe. Even if Trump had lost the general, the message would've been sent that we are no longer tolerating establishment candidates.  If you bail on anti-establishment candidates because of the result, without considering the bigger picture, then the GOPe has won. It's the same message that the DNC pushed on to their voters who were Bernie-or-Bust. Even when the election was RIGGED against their preferred candidate, they were told to get in line because ""We can't let Republicans win"".  Remember: there's no difference between RINOs and Democrats. The choice is an illusion. And what we're fighting for is much bigger than an election here or there.  But if you still wanna bail, then so be it. Many of us will fight the good fight until this country is rid of the globalists and elites who have us believing there's actually a choice when it comes to electing a candidate."

"This didn't occur to me until I was listening to the Dan Bongino show whilst doing dishes having come home from work (and having been too lazy to do them when they would have been easier last night).  His most recent show ended with a discussion of how much of a Tyrant, how obsessed with power Trump was.  He was so concerned with his authoritarian future for America that he's slashed thousands of regulations from the books, worked to reduce the tax burden, and ceded control of the Internet back to the people.  It took a second, then it clicked. I'd never thought of those words in that order.  TRUMP GAVE UP CONTROL OF THE INTERNET BY ALLOWING HIS FCC TO REPEAL NET NEUTRALITY.  All those people screaming and crying about the death of the Internet for the last week... why in HELL were they so worked up about Ajit and the Trump Crew at the FCC giving up control over their Internet?  Even in their darkest worst case scenarios, where everyone's devolved to point-to-point wired connections handing memes around on floppy disk... why in the HELL were they demanding that Trump KEEP CONTROL OF THE INTERNET?  Besides, it's not like the repeal is chiseled into stone or attached to Voyager 3 and hurled out of the solar system.  Any future FCC could make the same ruling they did in 2015 and put it all back into place.  Such is their preferred form of squishy bureaucracy where arbitrary rulings can be made on a whim.  If they really didn't like it, all they have to do is win an election and put the rules back (preferably fast enough that nobody notices how much better the Internet gets in the intervening years).  If you need any more proof that the people butthurt by Net ""Neutrality"" being completely uninformed about the issue and simply believing in it because it sounds good when Reddit and John Oliver tell them about it... this is it.  #They wanted LITERALLY HITLER to retain control of the Internet, with the full powers granted him by the Obama administration."

"Obama, in 8 years, failed to raise the GDP 3%. This is a fact.   In 1 year, Trump did raise it 3%. That’s a fact.   Economists and the mainstream media “experts” excoriated and laughed at Trump for his aim of raising it 4%. That’s a fact.   Trump went on to raise it 4%. That’s a fact.   History will not be kind to today’s liberals and Democrats. How can they be? This is a fact. Everything they claim will happen, turns out wrong.   When the corporate tax drops from 35 to 21%, the GDP will hit what I predict to be historic levels.   Sit back and enjoy. The left is on the left side of history, we are on the right side of it. "

I mentioned this to someone else as they are having the same issue.

He’s tweeting in Spanish about as much as he’s tweeting in English. And he’s also much less active than before. I could obviously be totally off base with all of this. However, all signs currently point to something fishy."

"So, maybe this could actually be bipartisan...  I am going to pledge that **I will donate the first year’s savings from tax reform to charity.**  I want to know how many ‘pedes would join me in this.  I am going to choose a local charity that is *non-political* (because political doesn’t count here) which helps children who have been victims of abuse.  Everyone should make their own choices but aim to use charities that *simply help Americans regardless of politics*.  I have no doubt that many here will follow this idea, I wonder if we could actually get liberals to do so as well?  It is *our money* but it is money that we otherwise would not have gotten back, so why not?  Let’s prove that independent citizens can do more good for the country than the government ever could.  Does anyone else think this sounds like a noble cause and a way to MAGA with our own hands?"

We know how deep state has been trying to demolish this greatest democracy from inside out with the help of federal reserve's.    That's why we voted for trump who is literally draining the swamp.

This is all political theater to make you guys think something is happening. But it’s not. In fact while you laugh at memes the line is in fact moving and not in our direction.   Prove me wrong. "
"I like to debate these things with opponents in order to sharpen my arguments.  NT is the Never Trumper.  1) NT: society has always taxed people to take care of the poor  Me: check your history, the 1st US taxes were legislated in 1861 to fund the war and it was temporary and in the 1870's it was rescinded. So your argument falls flat bc until 1861 there was no tax at all. Also the US revolution was caused in part by the taxes paid to England with no benefits.  Also, even if the premise is correct that society always took care of the poor through government you have to concede that taking care of the poor and what you give them has only become larger with time. So one might say that's is bc we have become more humane so we give more and we are richer as a whole (not government debt) so we can give more. In that case then basically capitalism is just communism but slower paced and with time as you add more programs more people will be eligible for these programs and every service will be government granted to most of the populace, just like communism that had a selct group of wealthy that were connected so allowed to have money and the rest got government rations, and eventually just as with communism there is not enough money around to spend like a drunk and the system collapses on itself.   Today more than 45% don't pay Federal income tax, that number will grow with more programs that people are eligible and then more people will say the rich are evil and the cycle will continue to charge more from those that make to fund the poor and you have evolved in to straight communism (it's technically socialism but the end goal is total control aka communism).  Then I thougt to myself shoudn't well to do people have their own Tea Party revolution, bc granted they do get benefits of the army,  etc. And roads eventhough many are in disrepair, but all the other benefits are not being used by them at all.  2) NT: you didn't build it yourself as you use government resources like highways etc to distribute products so you should pay more.  Me: of course they do but that's why you pay taxes on gas and you as a consumer use the roads too to buy the products, so maybe there should be a sales tax specifically for the roads and other government based usages in order for the products to get to stores like import controls authority bc the consumer uses it just as much as the vendor.  Then I thought to myself, if government didn't reallocate taxes that were for specific projects that would be great bc there would be accountability, but they lie.  Also, yes you went to school so might have used government aid for that but you weren't born in a lab, your parents paid for school taxes and it wasn't for them obviously, so if that's a government benefit that you didn't pay for then your parents shoudn't be charged for it. So obviously it's for their children. (Yes there are parentss who rent but they pay the landlords property tax, the only losers here are childless people so in a way they're paying it forward the same way it was paid forward for them when they couldn't pay bc they were children, and it's also community based (local government) so imo not so bad.  To sum up my thoughts:  If you claim you didn't build it yourself, then you concede government should only give benfits that help you. How does section 8 lead to success? (Yes, Ben Carson grew up and became a made man but that is rare) it  usually hinders success and breeds complacency.  If you didn't build it yourself then everyone has equal opportunity to succeed, which then leads to everyone paying equally bc you have the same acces to the roads, armed forces etc. So why should the rich pay more? They only use it as much you as they are only one person and the fact they have money has no effect on their usage of said services. Roads, I would argue that yes they use it more so there is more wear and tear but the consumers use just as much otherwise the vendors wouldn't be wealthy, so a portion of sales tax should be used for the roads but not income tax."
I decided to take a delve into that cancerous sub and you wouldn't believe the delusion. They are all up in arms and are citing polls again. They really did not learn anything from the last election. The GEOTUS is leading us into the future. I don't understand how corporations fighting for more money is a bad thing. The more money the business makes the more that gets passed to workers. They are completely ignoring the investment businesses are already making to their employees. The NaCl is overwhelming. So proud to be a winner. Time to get back to work and pay my taxes. Have fun sucking on the shrinking tit of the working public. 
"Another 6-D move by DT...  he will run in 2020 with the promise of making those tax cuts permanent...  any democrat from the house or senate who runs against him has to explain at every debate why they voted no to the tax cuts..  Two terms are locked in folks, enjoy it."

"Pede here, not a Russian bot. I’m 29, lurking for over a year and posting for just under a year. I grew up supporting conservative candidates. 2010 I worked for the local republican victory office doing robocalls and canvassing neighborhoods. With the desert of good candidates I talked to local conservatives about what they wanted in a candidate. I was young and a bit of a Neocon RINO at this point in my life. Was even called a RINO by one constituent who said he wanted Newt Gingrich to win in the2012  presidential election and left after 3 months pretty disillusioned with the Republican Party that seemed like it was playing to lose. In 2012 I actually wanted Gingrich to win the primary because he was the only republican candidate who seemed to have different policy positions than Obama. Voted for Romney even though he was basically running on watered down obama policy’s.   Fast forward to 2016 watching the republican debates. Blast of fresh air as Trump is the only candidate I’ve ever witnessed who had the guts to stand up for what he believed in even in the face of his party and MSM pressure. Before the debates I didn’t believe Trump was serious but after seeing him debate it became clear he was the only Republican willing to put his money where his mouth was, acknowledge the failings of conservative ideology in the past 20 years and provide a vision for America moving forward. Also he was serious about winning and not just providing empty promises of repeal and replace with no intention of following through if they are no longer the minority.  I live in a state which has a caucus system and went to caucus for trump and was the youngest voting age republican in my district. Of the roughly 30 voting age people in my district the couples who came and were roughly 30 to 45 years old all supported Rubio and those roughly 45-65 years old supported Cruz. All of these people during our meaningless straw poll expressed their disgust with trump and all voted first. I was one of three people who supported trump. The other two were over 75 years old who when called upon and voted before me expressing their support for trump and their anger at obama and cultural Marxism. I voted last, for trump. You could feel the icy stares. One of the Rubio supporters asked why I supported him. I gave my reasons, those listed above, lower taxes, America first, pro business. The older trump supporters came up and shook my hand afterwards.   The next week at the county meeting we were electing delegates to the State convention who would vote for the party nomination at the state level. No one wanted to go. We had more delegates positions than people who wanted to fill them. I signed up. When the list of people who ran for delegate were asked who they supported again I answered trump. Suddenly everyone wanted to be a delegate. The impression I got was that they only decided to run for delegate so that I would not have a voting spot at the convention. I still got to go but was an alternate with no voting privileges. My state ended up going Cruz.   GEOTUS proceeded to win, and is making America great again. First time in my life I’ve actually had a presidential candidate I was excited to vote for! Thanks for reading this condensed version of how I learned to love MAGA! How did you learn to love MAGA? What is your trump story?  TLDR; Republican’ts are terrible, and I’m so thankful GEOTUS is my president"
"Just overheard Tucker saying that her losing was enough.  I disagree.  I still appreciate Tucker and his efforts, but let's not tip toe around the fact that she committed multiple, felonious and treasonous crimes.   United States Code at 18 U.S.C. § 2381 states:  Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

"I work at a church and we do a lot for people in need and most of them are great people who just need some help, maybe they had an emergency and don't have the funds for it, maybe a job was lost and they need to make ends meet, maybe they lost their house in a fire. What ever it is, they are typically greatfull and very appreciative. So today  I  get a call from a lady looking for several hundred dollars assistance with rent/security deposit (after DHHS is already chipping  in $400) because she was hooked on drugs and got fired from 2 jobs before she even started at them, has no place to live but is collecting SSDI. We just went through 2 of the most popular months for helping and giving to others so our funding is quite short. When I told her we only had about $50 We could help with, she became angry, stating again that she still needs $500 and ""what's $50 going to do"" for her.   Listen up bitch get your addicted to drugs and welfare lifer ass up and go make some of your own money, don't get mad when people who help out of the kindness of their hearts can't pay for you to sit on your ass and do nothing but those drugs you ""were"" addicted to. It just burns me when someone asks for a handout then gets pissed they didn't get enough.

"This past year my employer switched business models, made everyone coming into manufacturing permenant instead of temp to hire, and raised starting pay 11.6%, bringing everyone below starting pay up with it.  Thats been huge for us. I work out of a massive industrial campus in an ecotourist blue state thats seen a lot of cuts, people earning in the single digits with no raises for decades and working with technology out of the '80s. Expansion projects are happening. Upgrades are happening, for the first time in a very long time. I don't think any of this would be possible without the promise of tax reform.  I had a good year. I worked very hard. Two second level managers came into my office last month telling me I was doing too much. I've gone from manufacturing to an office job two years ahead of schedule and seen 15% in total out of cycle salary increases as well as conversion from temp to permanent one year ahead of schedule. My manager tells me that my in cycle salary review come February is looking very good.  And the personal impact? I'm finally saving money, and saving bigly, towards replacing my car and owning a home. I'm able to send my mom, whose been on disability after a fatal head on auto accident, money each month instead of her sending me money.  Capitalism IS moral. Allowing people and businesses big and small to keep more of their money leads to better outcomes than redistributing the gains brought by good, value generating behavior to subsidize bad behavior.  I'm proof of this principle and I have a faint suspicion that I'm not alone.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC3W1lZpSmY"

"First of all, can we stop calling them ""liberals""? That's the furthest definition from what they are, they're Democrats.  1. It is as if Democrats concluded that the reason they lost in 2016 was that they just didn’t denounce Trump angrily enough.  2. The more ""democrat"" the worse. Almost every self proudlyly proclaimed democrat I've come across, yes I realize this is anecdotal, is the most self absorbed, narrow-minded, rude, vapid  pseudo-intellectual I've ever met that keep spouting the rhetoric they heard that, ""sounds good"". 3. They believe it is greed for an individual to want to keep the money they have or have earned, but it is NOT greed to want to take it from them. 4. They prioritize ""feeling good"" over achieving goals.For example, there was not ""collusion with Russia"", ever. It didnt happen. Stop. Seriously. Shut the fuck up, that shit never happened and deep inside I think you know it too. You are wasting time and RESOURCES on absolutely nothing. You are keeping people from doing their jobs and working on improving the lives of our citizens. 5. They think short term and small. They are petty and and will drop certain ideals like a bad habit. On the other hand, Conservatives stick to what they believe. They have mental fortitude and gumption.  6. Democrats do not originate ideas as much as you would like to think, and most importantly they are TERRIBLE about marketing them when they do come along. Trump knew how to coordinate effort from disperate groups on the right. 7. They do not believe in a ""silent majority"". 8. They would rather a Democrat administration run the country into the ground that have a Republican or Independent President improve the country . 9. They are stupid, stupid, stupid and will NEVER change any opinion they have if it doesn't suit the groupthink masses. Shut the fuck up you ivory tower twat, go back in the corner short pants, socialism is bad, communism is worse. It's been proven by facts and the deaths of millions. 10. They are really stupid, just so dumb."

"I wrote this to a ""friend"" on Facebook. It was a reply to (your typical) blah-blah-blah re: Trump. Let's just start with my reply and go from there...  Wow. Epic response, that is, if you're collecting stupid. Unlike you, I don't know what ""paranoid schizophrenic"" sounds like like the back of my hand, but, hey, OK, I'm not here to judge whatever first-hand, background experiences you want to bring to this conversation. But.. I'll say this...   Saying the tax cut was the ""payoff"" for Trump's donors ""and they'll move along, now"" is to assume there even were any ""billionaire backers"" behind Trump to begin with. Tell me, who did MSNBC ""inpeach foddy figh"" genius and hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer back? Marco Rubio. Who backed (and by ""backed,"" you know I mean ""owned"") Ted Cruz? Legendary Repuglican stalwart (and oh, look, also a billionaire hedge fund guy), Robert Mercer. And who backed Trump?  Himself...  Oh, and Hillary Clinton, via her SuperPacs... which we know from the Wikileaks...   Anyway. You're missing the ""Dickens meets Ayn Rand"" story of Trump, establishment outsider, taking on the entrenched, Deep State special interests (you know, in the FBI, DOJ, State Department, etc.). I'm not sugar-coating this, but... LOOK at the plot you're ignoring. A MAN WHO couldn't be bought (admittedly, likely because, for ONCE, they couldn't have afforded his price). What was Trump before the election? A reality TV star—oh, and a crackerjack businessman and real estate tycoon—facts I think we would both acknowledge. But, over the decades as politics became much more dirty and dominated with dark money, Trump became, more and more, something he wasn't comfortable with being. He had also become a burgeoning and (I would say) RELUCTANT oligarch who cut his teeth what was, at the time he entered, a relatively lawful and law-abiding NYC real-estate market, yes, but something that, by the time he entered politics, a landscape that had become a racketeering-infested, global influence-peddling dirty money machine.   OH, THINK I'M HIGH ON DRUGS, HERE, AND LIONIZING THE MAN WITHOUT EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP? FORGIVE ME, BUT, DID YOU READ HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH?  ""We will no longer surrender this country to the false song of globalism.""  Trump;—a man who famously works 20 hours a day—had grown angry at being pushed around by lesser men who commanded the System that he had always, in relatively good faith, accepted to be an equal playing field where it all boiled down to one man's smarts vs. another's. But, no more. The global business stage had changed. And not for the better.  Trump lost his taste for that private mud-wrestling contest once it stopped being televised in the early '90s. Still craving the spotlight, he diversified. His market? Himself.   But, to be direct, when will you (and others) tire of underestimating Trump? Trump has literally made ""underestimating Trump"" the cornerstone of his new empire. I was in NYC when he declared his second bankruptcy. I didn't learn much about the Man from the press coverage, but, I will tell you that I learned a lot about the dystopic, personality cult lens that most New Yorker's viewed him from. Income inequality at the time was only at that moment starting to take off like the rocket we see today. Back then, Trump literally was viewed as a ""blue collar"" billionaire. That label wasn't recently minted, say, during his campaign. It was his reputation on the street, strong as steel, and, as Trump re-structured himself up from his own boot-straps back into financial stardom, it was common to see him on the front page of the New York Post wearing a hard hat. He was legendary for being ""hands on"" with his projects as though his future depended on them, mainly because, damned right, his future fucking DID depend on him being hands on, knowing his shit, and leaving nothing to chance. He has hidden just how close he came to ruin, and he has hidden how many powerful enemies he either bested or merely survived who were OUT to ruin him. That's partly what I like and admire about him.  I don't give a RAT'S F**KING ASS whether he's EVERY grabbed a beauty pageant contestant where it counts. And neither do 60,000,000 other people. They're just money-grubbing gold-diggers hoping to cash in on their 12 months of 18.5 BMI. Who gives a shit. No one that has to work for a living, that's for sure.  What I'm saying is that, in the final analysis, we've witnessed under-estimating Trump grow  from being a local, New York past-time to being a nation-wide one. And now it's a global-wide one, and everyone is on edge, and rightfuflly so. I dunno what lens you were watching the last 12 months through, but, Trump made having your ass handed to you a national past-time DESPITE having provably the WORST press coverage of ANY president in the past 250 years, plus the worst economy handed to him since Reagan, plus the most polarized country and Congress of any President, EVER. Go ahead. Continue to play in the middle of the highway with this guy. I'm not going for it. No way. I know what this guy can do because I've seen him do what he does. He's re-made himself dozens of times. He used to be a high-society name, and that was it. This guy once bragged about having Hillary on his payroll (HRC even attended his most recent wedding, HOW ABOUT THAT). But he transformed himself into an Everyman that middle-America voters could identify with, WITHOUT pandering to the usual ""GOT AND TEH PRO-LIVE BECAUSE BAYBEHS"" bullshit from 20 years before. That doesn't scare you?? Seriously??? I'm staying the FUCK out of this guy's way. And so far, I approve of the things he's stood for (anti-trafficking, anti-corruption) and, hey, as entertaining as it's been, the things he's said, too. If you don't see that the US ""fiffth estate"" is OUT OF FUCKING HAND, then, wow, well, un-plug, man. We might not love his methods, but, it's downright SCARY how much Trump has been proven right so far.   And, as you will soon see, once people start to notice how HRC and Obama haven't tweeted in a while, the rest of the world will know it, too.  OH HEY, GUESS WHAT—JANUARY, 2018, IS NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH, HOW ABOUT THAT?! TRUMP ONLY DECLARED THAT A FEW DAYS AGO, WOW, WHAT ARE THE ODDS  SRC (above)  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416643/meet-ted-cruzs-billionaire-donors-eliana-johnson"
"Bc they didn't need to as it's a good thing that the tax cuts came last after millions died from the repeal of net neutrality, travel ban and deregulation. So the tax cuts shouldn't affect benefits bc there are millions less alive now to receive them.  Especially after 93 million Americans die from gun violence a day according to former VA governor Terry Mccauliffe. At least Trump was nice enough to kill millions 1st and then enact the tax cuts. Credit is due when credit is due."

"https://www.cchrint.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/guiltyverdict.jpg  Life comes at you fast - especially if you are Obama.  I am sure ‘Smidgen’ is in shock.  “What do you mean, I did something illegal???”"

"I do a fair bit of trolling. Nothing illegal or hateful, but I use a VPN to avoid any issues. If you do an IP trace when running this software, you will often be tracked to Russia. Have the intelligence agencies reporting meddling through Facebook posts, considered this? I very well may be one of the “Russians” who shit talked Hillary before the election, and I can assure you I’m not actually Russian.   Let’s get this question to Trey Gowdy! "
Now being told we have to wait to feel the effects. Gonna be a long wait.
Poor people will pay ZERO in taxes.  Small businesses will pay 14% less than a year ago. Its a win for America. 
Many people joked about moving to Canada if Donald Trump was elected because they believed America would go to shit.  How many of those people actually moved? None ��  
"[Genesis 1:9-13 KJV] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day."
"Hey guys, non-Trump supporter here. I just wanted to thank you for supporting the people of Iran - this situation is very dear to my heart and as a liberal-leaning independent, Trump's support for the people of Iran has honestly changed my perspective on him, as has your guys' support.   I was born in the U.S. and one side of my family is from Iran. My family in Iran has seen the terrible side of a theocratic regime first-hand, even though they are very wealthy and mind their own business. The fact that they are quietly atheist makes it even worse. Post revolution, my grandfather was put in jail for half a decade because he was an atheist, while a couple of my other family members were ordered to be killed because they had prominent economic and bank positions under the Shah's regime, but thankfully escaped.   Let me tell you guys that the young generation of Iran does not care for religion and they want a democratic government where people have the freedom to do as they please. They want to overthrow all religious and theocratic rule, but, it will be tough with the President, Ayatollah, and Revolutionary Guard always working hand-in-hand.   Iranian people need support from the West and Trump is providing that, as well as you guys. Much love.    "

"Sorry this is sort of random, but I can’t fuckin stand the bias anymore. I go to look up a review on “Future Man” and I get an expose on “Why there’s rarely been a worse time for this brand of Dude Humor”, I look up South Park episode reviews and they’re judged based on whether or not they attacked Trump/the Right (while also leaving out the Left, because just demeaning the Right isn’t enough - they can’t drag the regressive Left into it as well - they can dish it out but can’t take it basically).   Now I’m about to lose my mind, because I finished Peaky Blinders, come to Reddit to discuss, and see some of the most upvoted comments are that the director or w/e shouldn’t be getting the praise he’s getting for “strong female characters” bc too many die or are love interests (mind you, this show is set in the early 1900s). This phrase, “strong female characters”, is how many judge the shows here on Reddit I’m seeing.  Then, what caused me to finally break out and ask this is looking for reviews on the Black Sails sub, and I see people going on and on about something called the Bechdel test, something I faintly remember reading about. MY GOD, is this really how everyone looks at TV shows/movies nowadays!?    I just want to see a show discussed on its fucking merits, not its “diversity”. To be clear, I’m all for “strong female characters”, I even went out of my way to acknowledge it in Peaky Blinders (so I was increasingly frustrated when I went to the sub and saw so many upset about it). These men talking about this seem like such little weasels.   Am I just stuck in the past or something bc I want to see a show judged on its merits, not how many female or black characters it has? Is there a place to discuss a show that’s not constantly bringing these fucking ideologies into it? Sorry for the rant, and again, I’m all for “strong female characters” - that’s just not the first thing I’m looking for when I’m watching a show or movie. "

"Do you suppose that Trump is playing rope-a-dope until the perfect moment (e.g., an October surprise in 2018) to release a devastating barrage against the deep state and Democrats, consisting of the FISA warrant (featuring the Trump dossier), evidence against the FBI, evidence against the Clinton campaign, etc.?

(Assuming he wasn't the leak on other stuff,  which I may not believe).  Didn't even have the balls to leak it himself, go on record, nothing?  And nobody wants to talk about this???????

I'm an Alabama resident who lives out of state for work  I requested a mail in ballot for the last special election and never received the ballot   I came home for Christmas and my parents have a letter stating that my vote was received   Neither of my parents have admitted to voting for me and I trust them on their word  Does anyone know who I can talk to about investigating wtf is going on? I'm already upset about the outcome of the election but thinking that someone voted for me makes me sick  To paint a picture I had my identity stolen from school officials at mps when I was a kid so I'm not at all surprised about the possibility of something that sleazy happening
well not exactly what obama said word for word but basically the way Obama views The internet as dangerous place where people can surround themselves in selective information to feed their biase reality.   Good example is how thoese fake polls work that showed Donald trump having a 3% chance of being the president.    
"They wanted the US to become a third world country using the same tactics that gave rise to ISIS (advanced antifa) and brought oppression to the people of the middle east. The removal of statues, the rewriting of history, the perversion of culture. An entire civilization was brought down from fear of being labeled haram (here we're called racist, etc.) It's some scary shit to think about. Thank God for President Trump."

"How much tax money have we spent for global climate change research?  Billions.  What is the underlying cause of greenhouse gas emissions?  The human population.  How many of these multi-million dollar studies recommend, as a required critical step, lowering human population in developing nations (where human population increase is most accelerated) to address this problem?  Zero.  As an ecologist, I say stop giving money to climatologists.  These pathetic cucks can hardly forecast the fucking weather.  "

"Hi, I helped promote a synchronized mass meditation/prayer to pray for arrests of DC pedophiles earlier this year in March, and I feel guided in my heart to start a series of 4 weekly synchronized mass meditations/prayers on consecutive Saturdays to pray for justice, healing, empowerment, and support of all those who have been sexually abused in Hollywood, DC, and elsewhere. My focus is rape of adults and especially of children. This third synchronized meditation/prayer will happen today, Saturday, December 2nd at 1:11 pm- 1:33 pm (22 minutes) EST (10:11 am PST). Visualize the criminals being arrested leading to fair and public trials and send light and love to those who have been hurt by sexual abuse and human trafficking. Let's pray for the safety and empowerment of whistleblowers too. The intention should not be for revenge but for saving the children and the healing of humanity.  If you are unsure about the effect of mass meditations (also known as Maharishi effect):  http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/washington_crime_prevention_full_article.html  Please spread this message!   Below is a great meditation to do at that time, created by Meditate Change:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uf7WRUfA6E&amp;feature=youtu.be "
#FUCK THESE DISGUSTING PEOPLE
"WHY? Because he is an illegal immigrant not a white male.  Illegals immigrants are higher on the ""opression scale"" so they can get away with more while white women are lower on the ladder.   Imagine the reactions had this been an illegal immigrant killer and a minority or trans woman was killed? Why would it be so outrage-worthy to them? Because it would battle top ranking spots in the hierarchy.   "
"It makes sense because the illegal immigrant murderer didn't *intend* to kill Kate.. Just like Hillary Clinton didn't *intend* to send emails containing confidential information using an illegal private server in her basement, have and destroy multiple devices using hammers, ignore Benghazi, rig the Democratic primaries, and more!   Moral of the story: It's perfectly okay to commit crimes as long as you don't *intend* to commit them! "
"It is hilarious how many salty tears are flowing on CNN, MSNBC and the other MSM where they are literally dredging the bottom of the barrel to find anything that they can possibly slant to their benefit."

"This Alabama race has reminded me how much I hate today’s liberal movement. All it is is gathering as many celebrities as possible and hoping you literally brain wash the public into accepting your shitty policies by them being star struck. Just watching how they talk and how they try to win elections. They’re the thugs of politics. If you think today’s liberal wouldn’t make up sexual assault allegations to basically take away the majority you’re probably a huge Hillary Clinton supporter. I’ll just leave it at this, please, for god sake, please, do not let this Doug Jones thug win. If you guys don’t want Roy Moore or are suspicious of him vote for him and allow him to be investigated. Then if he’s guilty you just replace him with a republican. Please Alabama, we stuck a hundred middle fingers in the face of the MSM, left, and swamp people when we voted Trump. Do it again today. God bless"
This is what the president is fighting  http://www.citizenreviewonline.org/2010/Jun/communism.html  Understand what is in this document and you will make sense our political and cultural condition
We are currently producing a new show for a leading US network looking at how the lessons we learn growing up inform our beliefs as adults.  We will be talking to people of all different political orientations and from a wide range of different cultural backgrounds about their views on current affairs and global politics.  I would love to talk to you in a little more detail about the project so please let me know if you think you (or anyone else you know) would be interested.  Thanks!
"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.  Proverbs 22:1"
2017 is coming to an end and we still don't have an emoji for our men and women in uniform - but at least we have a Buckingham Palace guardsman ��...  GEOTUS hear my prayer.
Wonder how long that will last?

"Will those apply when we do our taxes here in a few months, or do they kick in for 2018 and we'll see the changes when we do our taxes in 2019?  Thanks."
"Do you guys think the near minimum wage jobs will go up at least a dollar in hourly rate?  I think that's something liberals are going o push hard in the next few elections, except they are going to want $15 probably.   Overall I'm excited to see the HUGE BENEFITS of these tax cuts, more money in my pocket just like Trump promised "

"Your state just opened the doors for violent illegals to ramp up their murderous behavior. They know that the justice system would rather virtue signal, than actually deal with criminals. I suspect violence will increase now they know their actions won’t have consequences.   Fucking do something you cucks. Take your fucking state back. Start fighting back against illegals. What the fuck are you waiting for? "
He's been holding that fucking wand up until now!
"I'm probably wrong that he had anything to do with it, but it's fun to poke at the snowflakes in MADcity.     Madison Wi is slated to get the F35's squadron at Truax.  I think my property value just went up!  "
That's right put all the cucks in one league and the based in the other and let em go at it! Versus each other.

"Would be curious to see if the lecturers and professors from the academy would be amenable to 325 million Americans being able to descend on their classrooms unannounced and without paying.  Given the reasoning the Neo-Marxists populating American campuses usually provide for accepting, harboring, and advancing the interests of illegal aliens [over American citizens], they should have no problem when those among the loud, ignorant, and unruly masses come and audit their lectures; participate in their courses without paying; interrupt, disrupt, and hinder their lectures without penalty; and sit in to enjoy all of the rights entitled to students enrolled and bank-rolling the very services prospectively abused.  I wonder what the Berkeley, Penn State, UCLA, and Harvard elite would think when those representative of the Americans they abhor self-identify as #COLLEGEDREAMERS. "
HANNITY on fire! Sanctuary Cities Killed Kate Steinle!
Shills fucking everywhere and NO FUCKING WAY the post on /all are legit without massive raiding and bots.    I don't care if you agree or disagree with the message of the posts (God Damn did McConnel take a lot of money from lobbies) but this is engineered and not what reddit was founded on. Its complete bullshit.     Spez favors traffic on Reddit that conforms to his view.    Spez: [Reddit shills don't like truth](https://imgur.com/a/DezLE)
HYPOCRITES EVERYWHERE!
Good lord...let's hope the infighting between all the factions in Congress self-torpedoes the 'muh precious DACA' bullshit.
"Been watching some CNN today to hear the insanity that is Being said now that Alabama judge has rejected Roy Moore request to seek new election.   Man CNN was not holding their talking points back. the white hispanic lady Anna Navaro called Roy Moore a crybaby a sore losers and a pedophile even after that fact he passed the polygraph test. Where's is that fact checking at CNN?  Now that Doug ""had to cheats to win"" Jones is the certified winner of Alabama senate race CNN just can't help but continue with the smear campaign against Roy, Bannon and Trump promoting the idea that they are all the type of people that likes to hear themselves talk that ingnores facts, history, and insists it's their nature to be a pathological lier that surrounds themselves with charlatans.  By far the most dominant view that was displayed here was the complicity at which to continue thier false narrative that is against Trump now that they have defeated Roy ""not a pedophile"" Moore.   Simply put it's all about stopping Trump and the people at CNN are not going to quit."
This is bullshit guys. Mueller should be in jail
Last year it was easy to find his pictures online when he was named as one of the investigators in the Hillary email case. But now this is the only one I was able to find and it was just deleted by PJ Media.
"I THINK HUGH JACKMAN WAS A GREAT CAST, AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB PORTRAYING WOLVERINE (AKA LOGAN) IN THE X-MEN FILMS.  VERY FAITHFUL TO THE COMIC BOOKS."
PotUS the wise.
I'd like to know what retard is advising this dummy to continue with this losing fight. The left is so unfamiliar with the idea of losing with dignity.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cfpb-mulvaney/disputed-cfpb-acting-director-plans-to-seek-preliminary-injunction-filing-idUSKBN1DW01N?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews
I don't think so.   I'd rather kick both Bitcoin and the Federal Reserve to the curb and revitalize the US Mint.  A blockchain US Mint coin would be revolutionary.
And seriously look at this timeline and how much Shit is being revealed every frickin week.      Now try and imagine what you would now be doing under President Clinton.. ( yeah I can’t go there either .. I’d be in PTSD if that shit happened.)
"I don't usually post here because cucks go through your account history and publicly humiliate you if you don't think the president is a fascist.   But this story is making me cry. Her last words were ""help me dad"".   In a fucking sanctuary city - how the hell can those things even exist?   And no justice. It just makes me so sad.   And people are more outraged about Matt laur or trumps tweets. I don't know a single person in real life who even knows this poor girl was killed let alone the details surrounding it.   I dunno what the point of this is, I just feel I have no one to talk to because it'll just be met with people calling me a bigot or something. "
Let's get it built and then take the wall building experts north and secure any weakness at our border with cuckistan

"The major plot arc is about a vet who was betrayed by a corrupt IC taking on a high level CIA op that's spying on the FBI to stop the public from finding out the illegal shit they did abroad (running heroin), AND at home.  Other major threads:   Gun rights being important and the hypocrisy of the antigun libs.  More vets getting screwed, dealing with PTSD.  A white man dealing with restriction of his free speech (he snaps under the pressure).  The absolute depravity of stolen valor.  Having sometimes to bear being painted as a criminal by the corrupt when you stand against them.  The power one righteous man can have to take down a corrupt system. (Punisher=GEOTUS)  Heck, even the OBLIGATORY empowered brown woman is from a secular (Pro-shah) Persian family who NEVER once mentions her religion, loves America and what it really stands for, and avenges her Jew partner.

"The [acquittal of Kate Steinle's killer](http://archive.is/Aq8qp) is pretty much a miscarriage of justice.   While I have my own personal theories (the DA's office, in collusion with the Public Defender, strategically over-reached with certain charges to ensure an acquittal), the results of the verdict are the same: ***No justice was delivered for the deceased Kate Steinle and her family.***  So, as a native San Franciscan who voted for Donald J. Trump, I am asking the rest of America to economically devastate my hometown and the state it resides in:  * Avoid coming here as a tourist (in SF, you will be robbed, and the perpetrators will only get an infraction and come back out to do it again),   * Take your business elsewhere — esp. if you are a tech company. There's cheaper office space elsewhere (esp. Nevada or other states), and if you're a tech company, you can tele-commute.  * Put up your conventions in another state, if you have that option.  Sanctioning the Golden State until it becomes North Korea is the only way to red-pill the rest of the Liberal garbage here.  Thank you."

He was eventually sentenced to prison for fraud anyway. John Beale, a former official at the EPA, pled the fifth on October 1, 2013 when Congress probed into Beale's theft of nearly $900,000 worth of salaries and bonuses from his own agency. John Sepulveda, a former VA official, pled the fifth on October 30, 2013 after Congress subpoenaed him to testify as to why the department spent $6 million on conferences in Florida. Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves, two senior officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs, each pled the fifth before Congress on November 2, 2015 when asked to testify about $400,000 they had allegedly milked out of a VA relocation expense program. They were eventually given back their jobs. Greg Roseman, a deputy director of the IRS, pled the fifth on June 26, 2013, after Congress asked him to testify about why the largest contract in IRS history was awarded to a close friend of his. Patrick Cunningham, chief of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona, pled the fifth when Congress asked him to testify about Operation Fast and Furious, which trafficked more than 2,000 guns along the U.S.-Mexico border. Lois Lerner, an IRS director in charge of tax-exemptions, pled the fifth numerous times during Congress' investigation into the IRS' targeting of conservative groups.

"If you are a CPA or Financial Advisor, be sure to clearly and pointedly show how much money your clients save under the new plan. (Especially liberal clients).   The more we get Main St talking about the savings the harder it is for the MSM to muddy the water.   Business owners should be very outspoken about why they are hiring and investing. Both to existing and new employees.  Chambers of Commerce need to consistently run stories in local papers about how the tax reform is positively shaping and affecting the local community.   Healthcare professionals and insurance agents need to express hope that this is the final blow to Obamacare and how ACA has negatively impacted the entire healthcare industry.   And everyone needs to earmark a portion of those savings and donate to local MAGA candidates that can greatly affect your community and bring a grassroots upswell for MAGA.   And if you are truly called, use this moment to consider involving yourself in local politics (School Board, City Council, State Legislature, etc).   This is a turning point"

"I am posting this again to get the message out.   **""Keep your plans dark and impenetrable as night, when you strike, fall like a thunderbolt"" - Sun Tzu**  In the spirit of Sun Tzu, let us became Hillary and Obama, think about what would you do if on their side.. they have not one plan but a series. The last in that series is an emergency plan, a fail-safe for them.. Turn Mueller up to 100, FORCE TRUMP TO FIRE HIM.  This is baseball folks, lawyer sports.. These fucks have spent tens of MILLIONS in man hours over the last year planning their case of all angles, including the ***fail-safe***. Trump fires Mueller, their $$$ plans come to life.  We will let them READ FROM A SCRIPT..   **It is like letting Rocket Man bomb Seoul..**  *No, you don't attack him head on and let his strength stay. You attack his strength from his weakness.*  Plan A for Obama/Hillary is Mueller will bring obstruction of justice charges that the House with an ""un-popular President in liberal circles"" can take and turn into 6 months of intense CNN live coverage of the ""Impeachment Hearings"" (even though they are only in the house, and are only the 1st step in a long list) This will NOT BE AL GREEN SHIT BOYS..  Obstruction of Justice charges kick off a machine in the gov.. a convener-belt of things happen that are drawn out and can be used against us from the dem's position of strength. THEY TAKE THE BOARD BACK!!  **Firing Him will only STRENGTHEN THEIR CASE THEY HAVE BEEN BUILDING ALL YEAR**  It is not designed to impeach Trump at that point, just a start, the Senate has the actual trial. The House stuff is more absolute riveting theater to DRIVE HIS POLLS DOWN AND NEUTER HIM ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE (by dividing congress over support even further)   **In the world of March 2017, this could work, but 2018 is going to be a storm by the end of Jan with the Inspector General's Report of corruption in DOJ and FBI.**  This alone will warrant a new Special Counsel that will then begin to **EAT MUELLER. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION.**   IF WE FIRE HIM, then we hand the board back to them.. that reality is much different..  Every snowflake soyboy pussyhat will be creaming in the streets, turn into Fred Astaire and sing in the rain.. etc. CNN and the rest of MSM can go 100% FULL TIME IMPEACHMENT TALK AND COVERAGE.  YOU BRING REALITY BY WILL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WE DID THIS TO ELECT TRUMP...  &gt; IMPEACHMENT THEATER IS MEME MAGIC FOLKS   It will seriously suck big time. I lived through Clinton years, I know what CNN can turn this into. The greatest show on earth for them. Every day every min, they will grouse and grovel over every fucking detail and line item. Trust me there will be tons to talk about.       ***BUT, attack from the flank, a weak and neutered Obama/Hillary ""obstruction of justice"" charge WITHOUT firing Mueller and WITH a new special counsel spun up by the Inspector General, now you have a pack of LARGER Lions hunting down Mueller and his wolves.***   ------------------- TL/DR  A) Fire M you play into the TRAP of Million $$ Hillary/Obama carefully laid plans (like letting Rocket Man bomb Seoul). they will be reading from their million $$ script, shit even Hillary started to leak some of this they have prepared.. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-dictator-us-president-justice-department-jeff-session-investigation-a8058821.html   B) **Use IG Report to hire SC and they go chimp-out without a fuck what to do. He will eat everything.**  Spez: Plan B has risk, ANY SC has ultimate power and can hire anyone, and can become corrupt and bias and can also run amuck and possibly find some past history in our side that can hurt us too. Many will argue end SC forever.   C) Bring so much evidence to light on the committee floors, hold FBI and Mueller in contempt, force him to step down under his own weight. This is much harder, because as you push back, they will ramp up Mueller and start leaking shit. This becomes more of a press each-other until one cracks, this can be loooong and drawn out in the MSM   -------------  The storm is real, from Rush to Grassley, they knwo all the details, wait for Jan and Inspector General's Report on FBI/DOJ Corruption and the Lions are unleashed.

"I didn't start the election cycle supporting or even liking our DRMVPCBANGEPOTUS. The whole reason I dig him as much as I do now is because I wanted the facts to back up my dissing. I researched him for cause to hate. The more I looked, the more I found I had in common with him (give or take billions of dollars). I thought it was pretty neat that he was sober without being pious about it. I figured I was alike enough in not drinking. But I did have a liking to weed. I really liked it, I still do.   Weed is fine enough if put on the same bench as alcohol, but regular use puts you in a category of options that just aren't optimal. You can argue that it is (or should be) a staple of life, and the anti-coffee of dusk, but there's still a reality around it you won't change with that idea.  I not only decided to quit the herb, but also California. I had a closing window to cut my losses, and what progress I had made in that state. I chose to pick up where I left off on the east coast with a family unit that genuinely supported me above tit-for-tat designated driving nights and video game company.  I always thought ""the future happens in California"". It might be true for a specific imagining, but not one I would have liked to be a part of.  I spent the equinox of 2016 getting to know our future president, and on November 8th I was sitting stationary in a bare den in Los Angeles on a charging phone watching the election map on data internet while speakerphone discussing the results with my wife on the other side of these united states. I spent the next day with an ""indifferent"" friend giggling at ""very concerned"" facebook posts. I had found my passion.  I wasn't a First Lady Obama about it at all. I wasn't ashamed (or not proud) to be an American, but the last few administrations were reskinned again and again leaving me to plan my future around the options I could exploit in the country I operated in and around. Our election of President Trump put the color back in my flags. I was on fire for America. I wanted to try my hand at Krav MAGA and it kicked ass. I was lucky enough to spend a summer holiday in one of the few towns in southern California that still flew our flag, and even the residents there remarked at my star spangled shine. It was nice. It's been nice.  I'm celebrating my first full month of complete sobriety. I was celebrating my first full year of making America great again when I got on that plane to quit weed and wine country. I miss my friends, but sometimes friends are for missing.   I'm trying to be a REAL MAN BLUEPRINT for my children, and my country. This timeline might be the only thing that made it possibly because it let me know it WAS possible. For me, for you, for all who want it.  I'm glad we're winners, because we win good. I'm glad you're all here to enjoy it, because you deserve it too.  I've also found a little bit of my religion again too. I'm still trying out these new legs, but they feel right, you know?  Be great."

This means McConnel should schedule vote after vote knowing the bills won't pass. It will force these 10 Dems to put on record that they're against the MAGA agenda and they'll be toast.

"From Boston Herald:   Voters also have an interest in knowing who else on Mueller’s legal team is biased. Not a stretch, as we already know many key players have donated heavily to Democrat politicians, including Clinton.

She also maxed out donations both in 2015 and 2016 to Clinton’s presidential campaign.

"Its been talked about how weak of a charge they went with.  And we all remember his ""I have a story to tell"" statement.  Is this charge meant to cloud his credibility when he starts telling his story?  "

"I believe there will be another silent majority happening in a lot of races during the mid terms. People are tired of this whining and can see the economy doing well. We are wiping out ISIS. He is making America first. This president is getting stuff done even with all of the distractions and he will continue to do so.   All they have is a loud voice. If you’re anything like me when that one negative, obnoxiously loud, person enters the room I usually slip out or avoid eye contact.   In other words I ignore them and don’t give them the time of day. "
"I am in a musical theater production (high school in Canada) and when talking about set design for a classroom they said to put up pictures of presidents and suggested turn trumps sideways and everyone excep maybe 4 people and myself were incredibly vocal with ""yes"" and ""oh yeahs"" it bothers me so much because I know that almost none of them can actually present a good argument towards why trump isn't a good president "
You can never have a party based on extreme morality because it's self defeating.  Your best policy makers and loudest voices end up being somewhere on the naughty list of your most ardent morality police.

"Feels bad man. I'm really torn up inside about this, my own father calls me a white nationalist to my face and others just generally act like I'm a monster for supporting Trump. I try to understand their views but often times I find them parroting the medias narrative, even some of the stories that have been completely false and proven so days later. So when I counter their view with proof they resort to tangent ad-hominem attacks against me or Trump. It angers me because they won't even let me be heard. I just wish one time, just one time they would try to see my point of view. Last night I really feel like it might be the last time in a while that I go over there. "

"The wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson has admitted that the ""Russia"" story would not exist without her husband.  She has implicitly admitted her involvement in the affair.  From The Duran: ((Link: theduran.com)   The Russiagate story concocted by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, who coincidently funded Fusion GPS (the firm behind the ‘Trump dossier’ that the entire Russia election meddling is based upon), is unraveling at record speed.  Mary Jacoby, the wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, who is the man in the middle of the entire Russiagate scandal, boasted on Facebook about how ‘Russiagate,’ would not exist if it weren’t for her husband.  Tablet Magazine reports…  A Tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now-famous dossier suggests that central elements of the Russiagate scandal emerged not from the British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s top-secret “sources” in the Russian government—which are unlikely to exist separate from Russian government control—but from a series of stories that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby co-wrote for TheWall Street Journal well before Fusion GPS existed, and Donald Trump was simply another loud-mouthed Manhattan real estate millionaire. Understanding the origins of the “Steele dossier” is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the United States.  In a Facebook post from June 24, 2017, that Tablet has seen in screenshots, Jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion’s share of credit for Russiagate. (She has not replied to repeated requests for comment.) “It’s come to my attention that some people still don’t realize what Glenn’s role was in exposing Putin’s control of Donald Trump,” Jacoby wrote. “Let’s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn.” This assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride; it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the “Steele dossier,” on which the Russiagate narrative is founded.  The Gateway Pundit reports that the news of the Facebook post comes amid heightened scrutiny for the opposition research firm. According to Fox News reporter Jake Gibson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called on a senior Justice Department attorney to look into appointing a special counsel to investigate recently demoted official Bruce Ohr’s contacts with Fusion GPS.

"Hello fellow pedes, Haitian here. Moved to the United States 15 years ago for better school system, became a citizen last year. I am so sick and tired of all the liberals trying to let everyone come and live off American taxpayer money. I became a citizen two years ago (THE RIGHT WAY, I didnt sneak across a border or live on welfare for years).   What i don't think ~~people~~ liberals understand is that you come to America to better yourself so then you can take that back to your own country (trust me, America doesn't need Haitians like Haiti needs Haitians). I am proud to see Americans take back your country (and yes, i count myself among you) just like i wish to take back Haiti and lead it into prosperity. I know you have been following the TPS recall, and yes I do support it. My people had been here long enougb, at some point you have to go back and take over your own damn country. You have to have pride in it!   So, i am creating a video series to help the libtards understand that we are not a monolith. Just because i am black doesnt mean i want to see this country flooded by everyone from every dangerous country. Yes, the earthquake was terrible for Haitians, I had family members die in it, but if we do not go back to fix it, who will?   I have set up a patreon and i hope you can help donate to the cause. I want them to see that we can build a successful video venture starring a black person. I am tired of their judgements and not being American born, you get pretty fed up with the liberals calling everyone and everythung racist. I want this to be done professionally. We cannot be taken seriously if we are filming in my bedroom, so any help would be greatly appreciated.   MAGA. ALSO MAHA (MAKE HAITI GREAT AGAIN) "

"Imagine two bathroom repair men.    The first guy comes in and says, ""Oh, this is nothing.

The second guy comes in and says, ""You've got rot in your floor boards.  It all has to come out.  Those pipes are rusting.  They're going to burst in less than a year.""  He tears your bathroom apart.  For a couple weeks it's a huge mess.  His approval is not very high during this time, but when he's done, you have a real bathroom that's going to last for decades.  That's the difference between Obama and Trump.  Obama took the moniker ""No Drama Obama"" because he wasn't really doing anything.  Every step he took was superficial, and his only goal was approval ratings.  He saw the political rot inside the deep state, but chose to work with the rot, rather than pull it out.  No Drama = No Results.  Trump is the opposite.  He doesn't mind making a mess.  He sees the rot under the floor boards in the FBI and he rips it out.  Yes, things are contentious now.  Things are messy now.  But think of how nice it will be to have a transparent government again run by people serving the country's best interests.  "
"We need to be serious here for a minute - I get that we like to shitpost and joke around, but Net Neutrality was a very important piece of law.

I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is Ajit cancelling Net Neutrality? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Ajit to be a good shill and keep Net Neutrality on behalf of all the major silicon valley tech companies funding all the propaganda for it. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought Net Neutrality could still win???? This is so fucked."

Once one of the most important Christian cities, they were forced to pay an Islamic ""jizya"" of $500 from ISIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul#Christian_Exodus).

Alexandria was considered one of the most important cities of Christianity just a few hundred years ago and Christians were the majority there. [Now they are under constant attack and many have immigrated away over the last few decades.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Egypt#History).  ## Lebanon ## - [Modern Lebanon was founded by Maronite Christians who worked to get recognition and support from France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Lebanon#History). - [The Christians built such a successful society in Lebanon that Muslims started coming in and now Christians are a minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronites#Lebanon). - Note: President Trump has a lot of support from Lebanese Christians.

They had a rich history there, including a kingdom, and sadly, conflict with the Christians (who have now completely disappeared from Yemen).  ## Saudi Arabia ## - Jews once had many towns and tribes in the Arabian peninsula, but they were either slaughtered or converted to Islam. This is well documented in the Quran. - For an illuminating read, [take a look at the life of Safiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safiyya_bint_Huyayy). She came from a Jewish tribe in Arabia. Mohammad’s armies came to them and beheaded all the men of the town. After witnessing all the men in her town publicly killed and all the children separated from their mothers, she was then “married” to Mohammad and he “consummated” it for three days afterwards. How consensual do you think it was for her? Given that she was “married” immediately after witnessing the complete destruction of all she knew and the beheading of her father. "

"This is mostly a Twitter thread from @Imperator_Rex3 If you guys want to be in the know, George Webb, Imperator Rex, Tracy beanz, Roy Potter, and 0 hour offer some interesting info. Some of it's speculation, some of it's disinfo, but it gets those synapses firing w better intel than the MSM.  Anyway here's @Imperator_Rex3's take for what it's worth..   I think we're seeing the final stages of this SC. Mueller may well just shut it down, clear Trump &amp; Co and then refer on 'other findings' to DOJ for action vs Clintonites and/or Obama.  The revelations about Strzok &amp; Page &amp; Ohr emails, as well as the obvious bias of the team (many are Clinton donors/affiliated) blew the credibility of the SC sky high.  This latest revelation of an allegedly illegal haul of transition team emails - either via the department involved, or via a leaked cache from somewhere else - demonstrate at the least incompetence, or worse, criminality. Nevermind the FusionGPS and FBI espionage.  The popular narrative is that Mueller's on a crazed witchhunt and that's why he's picked a TDS riddled team and is making decisions that are illegal, unethical, outside his scope and careless. He's an out of control 'Deep State' swamp rat hellbent on destroying Trump.  I don't buy it. Mueller would have known full well on Nov 9 that the Clintons &amp; Obama were doomed. Why? He's very smart, extremely experienced and knows instinctively which way the wind is blowing. And boy has the wind picked up.  Mueller would ALSO have worked out well before the election that the Trump-Russia DNC/Clinton smear was 100% BS. And as he watched Trump win the primary &amp; then the campaign, he would have realized that being Trump's enemy is not a sensible strategy.  Predicting a full-on Trump assault on Clinton and Obama that he could well be swept up in, Mueller did what all swamp rat veterans do : choose the stronger horse, being Trump. And ditch his old buddies.  It's not personal. It's just business to these folks.  Of course, I may be 100% wrong. Perhaps Mueller really IS as stupid &amp; incompetent as he appears to be. Maybe he actually believed he could lay the groundwork for impeachment of Trump, even though he knew the Trump-Russia story was fiction.   Maybe he deliberately staffed his SC with known partisan hacks and FBI corrupt agents, even though he knew they'd be surveilled 24/7, their comms with everyone inside and outside tracked. Maybe he hired a biased staff not caring that he'd damage the cred of his own SC.  Maybe Mueller really did indict Manafort for pre-Trump lobbying, money laundering &amp; fraud, has caused the collapse of The Podesta Group &amp; is investigating Clinton capo Tony Podesta because they are all linked to Trump-Russia 'somehow'.  Maybe Mueller was so reckless that he  decided to potentially break the law to get access to transition team emails. It couldn't be that he was watching while a corrupt team member either got the cache illegally (eg via an illegal leak), could it? Just speculating.  But the popular narrative makes a lot of assumptions about Mueller that I find questionable. It also makes no sense to me that Mueller would take on a role that he didn't need to, in full knowledge that his mission (Destroy Drumpf) was doomed to failure.  Maybe I'm giving Mueller too much credit. Or perhaps the SC has never been about Trump-Russia, was never intended to be - and that Mueller will close it down himself before Christmas, clearing Trump &amp; Co before referring it on to DOJ. Before he rides off into the sunset, legacy intact with an immunity deal in his back pocket.   Over 5000 (some say 9000) sealed indictments.. whistleblowers every day.. Trump has successfully goaded many federal officials into holding their officials accountable.. If you wanted to garner respect for/adherence to your military to back up your defence of Israel, you would give the population a reason to support them. Like ""taking down the deep state.""  We'll see. When the wind picks up, the house of cards tend to collapse. And it's storming RIGHT.NOW. L'chaim"

"With liberal cucks and SJWs dominating the media and controlling the narrative, Trump will never get the treatment or the credit that he deserves in his lifetime. He will be branded as a racist, homophonic, xenophobic, and everything-phobic and there’s nothing that we are going to be able to do about that for a long time. However, after this era has passed and new generations start to emerge who weren’t involved in this era of American politics, we will start to see a change. Historians far into the future will look back and realize Trump’s effect on the country and will start to attribute his accomplishments to him. And our movement that we have together will stop being branded a hate group and instead will be spoken about like every other movement to support previous presidents. Being Gen Z, my only hope is that I will live long enough to see justice be delivered to Trump at long last, after constant negative attacks on him and the media’s refusal to attribute anything to him and everybody fighting against him, forcing him to fight alone. My only regret is that it probably won’t happen in Trump’s lifetime. But we at least can still fight on to accomplish his agenda, and I’m honored that I get to ride the Trump train with all of you!

"[This](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2017/12/19/mueller-investigation-could-last-another-year-n2424481) from Townhall.  Congress needs to put Rosenstein on notice. Special counsel is not a life-time appointment. Either Mueller produces probable cause that a specific crime has been committed, and the investigation is narrowed to that specific crime, or the investigation is terminated.  Trump should not HAVE to fire Mueller. If this is a witch hunt, then Congress should step in and denounce it, and Rosenstein should have the integrity to put an end to it."

"This morning in the park with my daughter. A group of women and children, a few guys.  One asks if my Daughter is the same age as her Son. No she's 9 months older, but they're the same height. Yes I think my Son has put all his development into growing. I said don't worry girls usually develop a bit quicker, but obviously in the long run the boys will far exceed them.  Everyone went silent. I got nothing.   This evening back in the same park, one of the guys says geez you're brave! I said I didn't hear anyone disagree. He was prompting me to tell this other guy. So I told him. He went silent, then turned to the other guy and started talking about the cricket."
"May 26th 2005:  The nuclear programs of nations such as Iran and North Korea threaten to destabilize key regions of the world.   2005:  Adlai Stevenson was able to get tough, isolate the Soviets, and convince the world we were right.  Today, we face a similar situation. With the rest of the world questioning our intelligence capabilities, and nuclear proliferation threats from Iran to North Korea that may require action by the U.N. Security Council, we must be able to convince the world that we are right.

"​'Twas the night of the election, when all throughout Manhattan,   Not a liberal on the island knew their dreams would soon flatten.   America was watching their televisions with great care,   In hopes that the election results would soon be made aware.   The clock struck one AM, with some patriots already in bed,   While visions of a Trump presidency danced in their heads.  As I sat in my chair, with my girlfriend in my lap,   We let out a sigh over the lengthy election scrap.   When out from my TV, there arose such a chatter,   I sprang from my chair to see what was the matter.   Away to my iPhone, I flew like a flash,   Swiped open the lock screen, and entered my pass.   The headline on my phone was exceptionally glowing,   Giving hope to the future in which America would be growing!   When what to my eager eyes should appear,   ""Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania, it's now clear!""  With PA's electoral votes, it was simple arithmetic,   I knew in a moment: *it was the end of Hillary's trick*.   More rapid than her concession, his victory speech, it came,   And he tweeted, and shouted, and called his detractors by name:   ""Now ABC! Now CBS! Now NBC and CNN!""   ""On HuffPo! On WaPo! On Politco and failing *you know*!""   ""We will destroy ISIS, drain the swamp, and build the wall!""   ""Now it's time to Make America Great Again for all!""  So up to the stage, his family, they flew,   With a thunderous applause, Donald Trump joined them too.   Then, from my TV, I began to hear a roar:   ""USA!"" was being chanted by everyone on the Hilton floor!   He was dressed in suit, classy from head to his foot,   And his clothes were impeccable, nothing but a good look.   The aspirations of a country were riding on his back,   His temperament made it clear he would not take any flak.   His eyes were full of determination! His persona was nothing like Barry's.   He had a perspective, and a worldly attitude, that was anything but Kerry's.   His droll mouth was drawn up like a bow,   And the hair on his head was as gold as a pharaoh.   He had stumped his opponents, never offering any relief,   The outcome was no surprise: Donald Trump v. *a side of beef*.  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,   Soon let me know I had nothing to dread.   He spoke a few words, and promised to go straight to work,   Filling America with hope, he vowed never to shirk.   He pointed his thumb up, from the fist in his hand,   Signaling a beginning, to the world, and to his fans.   But I heard him exclaim, before he walked out of sight,   ""Make America Great Again to all, and to all, the end of liberal plight!"""

""Who knows what else the IG (inspector general) has.""   Chairman Goodlatte: &gt; ""It is very encouraging to us that (Horowitz) is doing what I think is good, unbiased work,"" the chairman said.  And: &gt; ""Michael (Horowitz) is a very solid guy with exactly the right background for the job. It's a job that doesn't make you many friends,"" Bromwich said. ""And I don't think a lot of people will be happy when it's over. But I think he is going to call it as he sees it.""  Mueller is not /OURGUY/. Fortunately it looks like Horowitz is the REAL DEAL and he'll see that justice is done with his report.  "
"In the wake of the rolling leaks from the Inspector General's investigation, it has now become crystal clear to everyone involved that Trump is not the  orange buffoon they assumed he was, but is in fact modern day Machiavellian and has played them all for fools for the last 2 years.    Why is Trump on Twitter today openly mocking McCabe's hopes of lasting 90 days?  What political MOAB is due to detonate in 3 weeks?    Once that OIG report hits, the eye of the storm will burst the dam attempting to hide their crimes wide open and a wave of HRC's effluence is going to flood out.  Many will drown in it.    Schmidt lashed himself (and Google) to Clinton, her ""right hand man"" and she is 3 weeks away from becoming the most politically toxic human being on the planet.  Despite the conspirator's righteous Tweeting and NYT op-eds, everyone can now see this.  They all know she is tied in to all manner of human rights abusers, corruption, money laundering...the list of crimes is endless and the reckoning is impending.  And that EO grants the government the power to take down anyone associated with any of those activities.  Anyone associated with the Clintons.   Schmidt is retaining his board seat since a sudden and complete company exit would imply they knew what was coming; much too incriminating in hindsight.   Stock up on popcorn, this show is going to go on for the next few years. "

"First of all - Merry Christmas to all of my fellow patriots and pedes!  Tonight one of my kids asked me what I wanted for Christmas. As I contemplated the question , I realized this would be no easy answer.  Then I realized, no matter what present I got, it wouldn't really matter all that much.  The feeling was somewhat reminiscent of how I felt when my hometown baseball team finally won the world series this past fall.  It was enjoyable but it didn't really mean much in the scope of things. Not like last year... when  we as a nation were in the fight of our lives for the very fabric of our American way of life.  Just think about it.   -- We were oh so close of going out  of existence. - exterminated  No more constitutional rights,... evil and corruption in all aspects of our leadership and our once proud and mighty FBI turned into the Gestapo by the evil Demoncrats.  A failed economy with fleeing businesses and jobs with a corrupt and complicit national media to further their cause and help consolidate their power. .  We were this close to going out permanently!  I didn't think the country stood a chance but I watched as millions of proud old fashioned American Patriots stood up and voted to make a change.  Not just any change, but drastic and dramatic change.  And so now here we sit on Christmas eve knowing the fight has begun to take back our country.  We all know it will not be easy but we also know we cannot go back .  It is here and now that, we will make our stand to rebuild this mighty and blessed country.  WHAT DO i WANT FOR Christmas?  That's Easy.--- Build the Wall &amp; lots more winning.  MAGA &amp; Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."

"Send it to your dem liberal media brainwashed friends as well  that think they won't see any benefit.  This bill will put significant money back in the middle class taxpayers pockets, where it belongs. Unfortunately, if you're rich or on welfare (and don't pay taxes), you won't see any benefit.

"The way Facebook (and advertisers) collect Inormation, to show you more relevant ads can be unsettling.  They had a category for US Politics (very conservative).  I'd say I'm more mildy conservative, middle leaning.  But still, of what relevance is this to Facebook?  And what business do advertisers have in the political realm?  And also as you can see a category for African Americans for some reason, with me being white.  What purpose does that category even serve?  How are ads for that useful for me?  Or is it more of a target to push this racial divide narrative.  Interesting.  I've only begun to see how Facebook utilizes the data it collects on me, going to be checking our other sources like Google.

"[John 1:1-5 KJV] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.  [John 1:14 KJV] And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  [Luke 1:26-56 NLT]... God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.   Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you!” Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean. “Don’t be afraid, Mary,” the angel told her, “for you have found favor with God! You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David. And he will reign over Israel forever; his Kingdom will never end!”   Mary asked the angel, “But how can this happen? I am a virgin.” The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God. What’s more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month. For nothing is impossible with God.”   Mary responded, “I am the Lord’s servant. May everything you have said about me come true.” And then the angel left her.   A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth. At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, “God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed. Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me? When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy. You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said.”   Mary responded,  “Oh, how my soul praises the Lord. How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior! For he took notice of his lowly servant girl, and from now on all generations will call me blessed. For the Mighty One is holy, and he has done great things for me. He shows mercy from generation to generation to all who fear him. His mighty arm has done tremendous things! He has scattered the proud and haughty ones. He has brought down princes from their thrones and exalted the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away with empty hands. He has helped his servant Israel and remembered to be merciful. For he made this promise to our ancestors, to Abraham and his children forever.”   Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.  [Matthew 1:18-25 KJV] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.   But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.   Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.  [Luke 2:1-20 KJV] And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.   And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.   And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.   And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.   And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
"I’m currently at the TurningPointUSA summit here in West Palm. High energy would be an understatement.  But I was at a bar earlier and saw Based Bicep Merchant on the Fox tube and got to thinking. Judicial Watch, with no exaggeration, is doing the work that the FBI, CIA, House/Senate intel committees, and entire DoJ SHOULD be doing. And they’re insanely efficient at what they do.  I’m not saying those other alphabet soups aren’t doing things behind the scenes, we have no idea and only have trust in that justice will come.   So deeper down this rabbit hole I couldn’t help but think that Sessions and Trump gave JW a little wink at their war in suing the living shit out of the establishment.   This does a few things.  - JW is entirely removed from Trump and the DoJ. If Sessions was openly breaking happenings and on the attack like the JW team, then it would be hounded by the media as a political hit job against opponents (purely projection because that’s what they’re guilty of). No chance in the revelations or the hunt being painted as Trump weaponizing the government.  - The DoJ definitely has their own stuff brewing in the background. As they say, the silence is deafening. Well close to silence. But once the shit hits the fan, I assume the DoJ will cite JW revelations as a main factor in why they’re opening the flood gates to huge investigations, subpoenas and indictments.   - Shoes the efficiency of the private sector compared to sluggish government. I hope JW and the work they’re doing on all this will be used as an example/reason to cut funding and scale back these politicized institutions.   I could go on but I just had a hunch that JW is part of a bigger chess game. Especially with the new Executive Order GEOTUS signed today in regards to human trafficking and corruption.  We’re coming up on one of the biggest happenings in American history. Can just feel it in the air."

"If you want a sensible discussion from a Trump supporter, go to /r/AskThe_Donald/ on Reddit and just submit a post saying what the discussion is about and why you don't understand our opinion and how we could have this stance, the people in the sub are generally nice and welcoming no matter who you are whether you be gay, black, white, Mexican, Sikh or any other race, religion, or sexual orientation"
"Most of the time they are able to just keep lying and twist things to seem like they were right.  Their hysterical predictions of people dying and middle class paying more taxes is going to bite them hard.

If anyone ever considered starting a business, NOW IS THE TIME to pull the trigger.  Next year is going to be like nothing we've seen in this country in a generation or more.

"Everyone is in Bitcoin. But it feels like that is just controlled by the Chinese and a bunch of snowflake hackers. Ethereum is in the hands of big business (IBM, JP Morgan, Microsoft, etc). The same goes for Ripple (UBS, Santander, etc)...   I have been searching for one that I like and I found TRON (TRX), it trades on Binance.com. It seems like it's all about decentralizing content. I can get behind that, the less media I get from the mainstream the better.   The website says ""The protocol allows each user to freely publish, store and own data, and in the decentralized autonomous form, decides the distribution, subscription and push of contents and enables content creators by releasing, circulating and dealing with digital assets, thus forming a decentralized content entertainment ecosystem.""  Does anyone know anything else about TRON? What else are people buying?"

"As a legal immigrant I have to say that nothing in politics pisses me off more than people (the left mostly) defending illegals. On a personal level it pisses me off because I know how hard it is to do legally (4 years school sponsorship and 7 years employer sponsorship), all the while paying taxes with no guarantee to ever be entitled to anything. And these people want to come here illegally and jump the immigration line without paying anything in taxes! I say hell no, stinky thieves.  Then in pisses me off on an intellectual level when the left defends them with ""but they just want to have better lives for themselves and their families, everyone deserves that."" Bullshit. When someone robs a bank because they are piss poor and want ""a better life"" you don't glorify them, you throw their asses in jail for a very long time. To that the left usually cries out that ""but it's not the saaaaame."" Bullshit, it is the same. When you rob a bank you steal from other people (be that shareholders, depositors, bank employees, or usually insurers that end up being on the hook). When you work and live here illegally you are stealing from everyone else: 1) you don't pay any taxes so everyone else has to pay higher rates because of pieces of shit like you 2) you don't have health insurance so when shit happens and you go to the ER you don't pay anything and everyone else has to pay higher premiums to compensate for pieces of shit like you 3) you steal jobs from a law-abiding American, and so on.   Illegals are thieves."

"The Night Before Trumpmas  Twas the night before Trumpmas at the DNC, Everyone was crying and screaming Reeeeeeee; US flags were burning because Liberals don't care, In hopes that soon socialism soon would soon be there;  The interns we nestled all snug in Conyers' bed, as visions of Russian collusion danced in their heads;  Clinton was deleting E-mails, Franken was groping a sleeping lass, And John Podesta had just settled down to a piece of 9 year old ass;   All of a sudden CNN was a chatter, Bill Clinton stopped raping his intern to see what was the matter; A man was on the TV talking about patriotic zen, At that moment Bill though, ""Shit, he's going to make America great again"";   The sun was rising on the new American dawn, Returning the nation to greatness it should have had all along; When, to Bill's wondering eyes what should appear, One of America's greatest sons, who didn't do drugs or beer;  With a god-like presence that told all he couldn't be stumped, In a moment Bill knew, it had to be Trump; More rapid than bald eagles, his cabinet they came, He tweeted, and shouted, and called them by name;  ""Now Mattis!, Now Mnuchin!, Now Tillerson!, and Kelly"", ""On McMahon, on Sessions, On Carson, and Haley""; ""Find all the illegals and deport them all!"", ""Once they are out, BUILD THAT FUCKING WALL!"";  And then, in a pivot, the elite he did scorn, He said with a grin ""It's time for tax reform""; He slashed the tax brackets from seven to four, and said ""You think that's all, just wait, there is more"";  ""Nintey-five percent of homes will see their tax fall"", ""Two-income households under $50K will pay nothing at all!""; The Dems watched in horror as their breath did abate, As Trump proclaimed loudly ""Fuck the ACA mandate"";  He was dressed in a fine suit from his head to his feet, And he attacked all his enemies an epic tweet; He called out the spineless Senate cuck Mitch McConnell, And also that Hollywood lard-ass O'Donnell;  Clinton did ask ""Why am I not fifty points ahead"", Huma said ""that would require you to get out of bed""; The DNC then killed a man who exposed this corrupt witch,  To this day we still say ""His name was Seth Rich"";  At the debate Clinton insisted that Trump a racist, Trump simply pointed out that Bill Clinton is a rapist; ""Thankfully you're not the law"" she did rail, Trump simply responded ""because you'd be in jail"";  Election day came, and the media did fawn, ""The exit poll predicted Hillary has won""; But the polls were wrong and only Bannon had the knowledge, And soon Trump BTFO of the Electoral College;  Trump Took office with out a wage nor any pomp, And swore to the nation ""I will drain the swamp""; Trump got to work, a proclamation he did pen, it read ""Merry Christmas to all let's MAGA again"";  SPEZ: Corrected some spelling errors.

"The word gender was only invented because people were uncomfortable with saying the word ""sex"" because nowadays it has come to mean ""sexual intercourse"". Except we shouldn't be afraid to say it because it is just a word with an innocent meaning.   The term ""gender"" was later hijacked by the LGBT community and separated from the word ""sex"". They completely ruined society and now we have a HUGE mess to clean up. We need to merge ""sex"" and ""gender"" to mean the same thing. Or completely remove the word ""gender"" from our vocabulary because it serves no purpose and is just a synonym that causes massive problems.  Btw it's perfectly okay to say sex"
"A quick glimpse of Twitter after GEOTUS’s recent tweet brought me to the article referenced at the bottom of this post.  It was from NASA and because I (and T_D in general) is open to valid arguments and reason, I decided to check the article out.   What I found, was the most unscientific and exhaustively stupid article I’ve ever read.  And it’s coming directly from leftists as an authoritative climate change piece from NASA so it’s a great reference document to completely rip apart.  If ever there was a reference article proving “climate change” is basically leftists complaining about the weather, it is this article. It was being linked with tweets like “OMG DRUMPF, learn the difference between weather and climate, duh!!”  With an open mind I read this article and it is nothing short of amazing.  It exemplifies why we and many like us look at “climate change” as an excuse to fund various insider projects and is a narrative backed by a mountain of money (Paris Accord, etc.) as opposed to hard science.  **BREAKDOWN:**  In DJT’s tweet, he makes a jab about global warming because of the cold weather he personally experienced.  DJT was destroyed on twitter for basing his idea on his experiences and yet, here’s a direct quote from this article: “If summers seem hotter lately, then the recent climate may have changed.”  Literally, it describes that climate change can be determined by your personal experience with the weather.  Yes that’s right; A NASA article about climate change, defining climate change by how the weather feels to you.  As other hard evidence of climate change, the article mentions that older people’s stories about walking up hill both ways in the snow could possibly be referencing climate change.  Quote from the article: “Today, children always hear stories from their parents and grandparents about how snow was always piled up to their waists as they trudged off to school.”  Un. Fucking. Believable.     In this NASA article, it literally explains that Climate and Weather describe and measure the same exact criteria.  Basically, the only difference is that climate looks at weather averages over time… sometimes.  There is however, no exact measurement of time, no authoritative and set timeframes, and remarkably, there are times in the article that weather and climate timeframes are used interchangeably.  As an example of this: it points out individual weather events and calls them “recent climate” changes.  Seriously, what in the living fuck?    Literally a quote from the article showing how there is no set reference for weather, climate, or timeframes: “Some scientists define climate as the average weather for a particular region and time period”.  Wow, how convincing.  **SUMMARY:**  I encourage everyone to read the article.  It is enlightening in its stupidity and exemplifies why many people don’t just follow the crowd on this issue.  Any leftist lecturing you about “climate change” is literally just complaining about the weather and their own references prove it.  [Source Link to the NASA article](http://archive.is/aYKWN)   "

"We know his name, but I cannot find a single picture of him. We don't know what he looks like. If they put someone in front of a camera and say, ""we've got him! This is Peter!"" and then put him in jail, they could try to walk away scot-free.  This ONE guy is the linchpin that ties all of this together? I don't know if I'm buying it."
Since apparently it's legal to kill American women in that city :/ wat do
This guy was not a US citizen. How is he afforded the right to due process as specified in the Bill of Rights for citizens of this nation?
"So two Roy moore polls were released today.  A fox news poll showed jones winning by 10 points.  An emerson college poll showed Roy moore winning by 9 points.  Fox, despite the cucks is generally pro trump and emerson is a liberal Boston college.  Emerson sampled 600 people, fox didn't release their numbers.  Could somebody help give an objective EXPLANATION of why these findings are so different?"
 Deep state scum
"Liberals Have Turned The FBI Into A Disgrace  Kurt Schlichter |Posted: Dec 07, 2017 12:01 AM  Share (6K)    Trending     ""Add this infamy to all the other crimes of the liberal establishment – its poisonous influence has converted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the eyes of the American people, from a proud institution dedicated to upholding the law into just another suppurating bureaucratic pustule. Where once we saw FBI agents as heroes – many of us ancients grew up watching Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., every Sunday night – now we see careerist hacks looking to suck-up to the Democrat elite while bending the law and subverting justice to do it.   Truly, everything liberals touch dies.  The revelations about Oh-So-Special Agent Peter Strozk shouldn’t surprise anyone, as bad as they are. Even that hack Robert Mueller couldn’t keep him all-board the Russia Soft Coup Express after Strozk’s anti-Trump texts to his FBI mistress came out. Shocker – this is the same Democrat-loving clown who watered down the Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit investigation conclusions (helpfully drafted months before the investigation concluded).   Oh, and he oversaw the unsworn, unrecorded interview of his special gal (not the one he was cheating with; the one with the taste for Chardonnay and failure who would have helped his career as a reward for his slavish devotion had she not botched running against Donald Trump). He was also in on the ambush of LTG Mike Flynn, who he and his scuzzy compadres decided to prosecute while the Harpy, Huma and all the rest of the Clinton Nostra got a pass.   Oh, but for the lefty in-crowd, it’s “Bros before Bureaus.” The new head honcho Christopher Wray – Where the hell is he hiding anyway? Is he locked in a gimp box somewhere in the Hoover Building? – didn’t even fire Strozk though intermural adultery is allegedly against the rules at the FBI. Nope, nothing builds confidence in a law enforcement agency’s organizational integrity like bending the rules to protect your bigwig buddies.  Oh, wait – outright payoffs do too! Don’t even start on Andrew McCabe and his wife’s Democrat contributions – to her. Yeah, the wife of the FBI second-in-command got money from the Democrat Party and he’s still not recused from this fake investigation. Are you kidding?  By the way, have we got even a single iota of information on what the unholy hell happened since Special Agent Johnson and Special Agent Johnson took over the investigation of the Las Vegas shooting?  It’s long past time to lance this boil. It’s sad when you have to accept that you can’t talk to the FBI, that they can’t be trusted to do justice, that you must protect yourself from being railroaded like LTG Flynn was and always – always always always – demand to speak to your attorney and demand that the FBI not question you if they come sniffing around. LTG Flynn trusted them not to have an agenda. Look what happened, and learn.  It’s heartbreaking, because the FBI’s real legacy – a legacy field agents largely live today – is a legacy of heroes.  Flashback to Miami, April 11, 1986. Eight agents make a felony stop on a car with two suspected bank robbers, igniting a firefight that demonstrated the bravery and devotion that should be what first comes to mind when any American thinks of the FBI.  William Russell Matix and Michael Lee Platt were ex-military and had killed before – and they packed an arsenal that ensured they were not going quietly. The FBI agents, lightly armed with under-powered handguns and a couple 12 gauges – came under intense rifle fire that the light vests some wore could not stop. In the end, seven of the eight agents were hit – and Special Agent Benjamin Grogan and Special Agent Jerry Dove died fighting.  This was no long-range stand-off – they fought it out with these psychos from just a few feet. Matix and Platt were both hit, but they were not going down. The agents were literally shot to pieces, but despite being outgunned, they didn’t back off. Not one inch.  His forearm shattered by a .223 rifle slug, Special Agent Edmundo Mireles, Jr. (no surprise, a former Marine from Texas), pumped his Remington 870 shotgun with his one good arm again and again as he engaged the criminals. His buddies dead or wounded all around him, bleeding out, Mireles then drew his .357 and advanced on the pair, in the open and totally exposed, as they attempted to drive away in one of the FBI cars. He put six magnum slugs into the criminals and finally put them down.  Matix took six hits to kill, Platt a dozen. And Mireles? This hero went back on the job, and actually worked with my former battalion commander Colonel (Ret.) Bill Wenger in Afghanistan in the 2000s on assignment there for the FBI. Now that’s a patriot. Now that’s what the real FBI is all about.  This dramatization gives you a good idea of what happened. The legendary Miami shootout has been studied for three decades to gather lessons learned about proper tactics and equipment, but the most important lesson it teaches is about courage.  That’s the courage that these desk-riding bums in Washington are dishonoring every time they sell their souls and their honor to kiss up to skeevy politicians.  You see that sanctimonious clown James Comey on Twitter presuming to quote the Bible, and it’s all you can do to keep your lunch from launching. These timeserving ladder-climbers are not what the FBI is, but their petty institutional gamesmanship has now seared that impression into the consciousness of millions of Americans. When you would say “FBI” to a liberal, he/she/xe would snarl, seething at the Bureau’s reputation for taking out the foreign and domestic terrorists progs love to play footsie with. But the tragedy is that when you say “FBI” to a conservative today, you get a sad shake of the head because we can no longer trust the Bureau because the top ranks are manifestly riddled with vindictive partisans angling for their own advantage.  Mueller, then Comey, and their progeny have done this. As liberals inevitably do, they have disgraced yet another proud institution. Imagine yourself a field agent, dedicated to upholding the law, and having to not only live under this corrupt regime but to have to share in the contempt the American people have learned to feel for it.  It’s heartbreaking, because the reality of the FBI is not the Muellers and the Comeys and the McCabes and the Strozks and whoever Strozk was having an affair with. It’s Special Agent Benjamin Grogan, Special Agent Jerry Dove, Special Agent Edmundo Mireles, Jr. and thousands of others who put their lives on the line for us every single day. They aren’t in the big upper-floor offices at HQ hiding documents from Congress or leaking to their pals at the WaPo. They aren’t mingling with Democrat bigwigs, schmoozing for their next step up the ladder. They’re doing their job.  Maybe the FBI can recover its reputation someday – I sure hope so. Maybe it can earn our trust and respect again. But the first step is for the President and Congress to pop this bureaucratic zit and clean out the pus.""  http://archive.is/NEGlf  "

"This weeks been pretty crazy so tonight I decided to put my feet up, start a fire and listen in to a popular nighttime radio host.  He is about as left leaning progressive as you get, but I love listening to his song and dance.  He goes on about how ""angry"" he was at ABC for the false news story and how it doesn't make his job any easier...so I decided to text him and start letting him know he is no different than ABC. How could he actually think we don't pay attention that you all have the same talking points and use the same dang made up phrases? I called him ""The Enemy"". He started going through all of them... Increasingly more heated, saying he's not the enemy, he's such a nice guy.   He's now had an entire news break with commercials to shake it off, he's called himself ""The Enemy"" twice more now.

"in brief: was the ""insurance policy"" discussed in McCabe's office the contents of the ""insurance"" file identified on Weiner's laptop?  In a hypnogogic moment it occurred to me that the term ""insurance"" had come up twice with Clinton intrigue: we learned of a file labelled either [""insurance""](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a86kh/the_weinerhuma_files_were_supposedly_in_a_folder/) or [""life insurance""](https://www.silverdoctors.com/headlines/world-news/report-anthony-weiner-laptop-emails-huma-abedins-emails-on-weiners-laptop-were-in-a-file-marked-life-insurance-hillary-clinton/) on Weiner's seized laptop in 10/2016.  Recently, we learned that [Strzok, Page, and McCabe had a pow wow to discuss an ""insurance policy""](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/19/report-fbis-peter-strzoks-insurance-policy-text-was-referring-to-russia-probe/) to prevent Trump from being elected.  I found one [blog](https://steemit.com/news/@defango/futurecast-peter-strzok-and-the-weiner-insurance-file) that discussed it, albeit in a confused manner and tying things to the Mossad.  Wouldn't it be fascinating to see the contents of the Weiner file? Could it have an early form of the Steele dossier (perhaps straight from 4chan fan fic)? Notes from the McCabe/Strzok/Page meeting? Lists of MSM pundits ""on the take"" to drop data to for pushing a narrative? Fusion GPS ties spelled out? DJT Jr Russian meeting honey pot plans?  It was widely presumed that Weiner's insurance file was a protection against Arkanicide for Abedin/Weiner, but perhaps it was something else - a set of files that connect the IC to the Clinton cabal to document a planned coup.  And thank you to the left, and this time line, to allow me to post the phrase ""Strzok Weiner""  "

Please remember that in the UK the silent MOJORITY came out and voted in force for BREXIT which was a huge message to the globalists and to our failing government themselves that we want to put BRITIAN FIRST!

We here have the same issues as the US with fake media only promoting their own agenda but what we here is even worse guys ..... people are facing jail for speaking out and telling the truth that ISLAM and SHARIA Law oppresses woman and does not fit with our way of life and our society!!

"I doubt they even realize it, but I tried to watch from a normie's perspective and was like holy fuck, this literally hits on everything Trump has been fighting to stop.

"Sessions recusing himself played directly into their game plan.  It WAS their game plan which is why they demanded it.  They had Rosenstein standing by and he too was involved in Uranium One. Trump for two years calling for investigations and to ""lock her up"" forced their hand. Don't forget, Obama and team used the full measure of the US spy apparatus to illegally surveil the opposing political party.  The surveillance and unmasking of U.S citizens, the Trump Team, was highly illegal and the biggest political scandal of all time.  To make matters worse, ALL of the intelligence heads were complicit in this operation and with Trump winning they had a vested interest to make sure they covered their own tails.  Self preservation at it's finest.  But it only worrked if Sessions recused himself and they got the Special Prosecutor. *We are here.*  Hillary allegedly said after the Matt Lauer interview, when he actually asked her tough questions and grilled her; **""if that son of a bitch wins were all going to hang.""** She was infuriated Lauer didn't give her the softball, kids glove approach. After all, she's Hillary Clinton and that's her deal with the pressitute media.  All of this was planned and orchestrated in the Clinton War room on Nov. 9th and 10th as so outlined by several news articles including the link below.  Here's a quote:  **""Bitter to the core, she and her campaign aides hatched a scheme, just 24 hours after conceding the race, to spoon-feed the dirty rumors to an eager liberal media and manufacture the narrative that Russia secretly colluded with her neophyte foe to sabotage her coronation.""**  Sorry folks, but this isn't 88D, intergalactic chess.  This is the Deep State and Cabal working their counter attack against 45 and it was put in movement immediately after the election. When Trump was creating a transition team and hiring people for new jobs, McCabe at the FBI and other Deep State saboteurs were interviewing Mike Flynn and laying the ground work for their future plot and subterfuge. Will it work?  I don't know.  It's been successful to date.  Will it eventually boomerang back upon them?  If there's justice in this world, yes.  I think Trump has been going softly - and instructed to go softly by counsel - against the DNC/Clinton/Obama cabal until ""the Special Counsel is complete.""  I think they've told him **""lay low now, sir, you don't want to muddy the waters and look like you're doing this out of spite because YOU'RE under investigation. It'll only make things worse.""**  This was their plan.  Put the man who wanted to do the investigations UNDER investigation.  Slow him and try to destroy him before he can destroy them.  This was a sinister plot.  To date it's working.  https://nypost.com/2017/10/26/how-team-hillary-played-the-press-for-fools-on-russia/"

"Mexico’s ruling party rammed a bill through Congress’ lower house Thursday giving the military legal justification to act as police, steam-rolling objections by rights groups and opposition legislators who said it would effectively militarize the country. Supporters of the bill said Mexico’s armed forces have to stay in the streets to fight gangs, given the incapacity or corruption of local police forces.

"""Additionally on Friday, Sen. Cruz filed an amendment to the bill that seeks to expand school choice by expanding  popular 529 College Savings Plans to include K-12 elementary and secondary school tuition for public, private, and religious schools, and also to include K-12 educational expenses for homeschool students. Adding homeschoolers and expanding 529’s would help ensure that each child receives an education that meets their individual needs, instead of being forced into a one-size-fits-all approach to education. Currently, more than 75% of 529 savings plans are from families making $150,000 or less, and this expansion of the 529 program to help K-12 expenses will further help hardworking Americans and their families save and prepare for their children’s future educational expenses.""

Now, anyone searching for ""Comey big deal"" is filled with pages of results from outlets referencing Comey's change of tune from...  &gt;“I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience,” Comey said in testimony on May 3.   There is always the question about President Trump's reasoning for not firing Comey immediately.

"I'll tell you, when I watch ABC News, to me, so much of it seems like propaganda.  They seem to always bring out the same faces to deliver the political and state-of-the-world news.  It's amazing to me how such an important job could be assigned to such a small number of on-screen faces.  Maybe they are the ones most trusted to say what whoever is in charge of the news wants them to say?  I also have a hard time believing that these people are out in the field, gathering the data to investigate stories.  How would they make it back to ABC in time to appear on the TV shows so much?  I admit that I don't know how their job works, but I mostly guessed that they just read other people's writings, other people's work.  And I suppose they need time to eat right and exercise too -- you notice how much thinner the top TV journalists are, compared to so many regular Americans.  Maybe they figure that if they look better than the regular American, then regular Americans will let them tell them what to do?  I have a hard time believing that one of these people is responsible for everything they report on.  What if one of them wanted to surprise us and put out a ten-minute video of all of the positive things that Trump has done, or how unfair the mainstream media has been to Trump.  Would THAT make it to the public?  Thus, I have a difficult time believing that stuff makes it on mainstream media TV (other than accidentally mis-speaking) which others at the network had nothing to do with. "
"He said we would get tired of winning.  Obviously, that was a lie, and we must show him he can't get away with this!  I, for one, will let my voice be heard by voting for a second term, forcing him to  MAGA overtime, I suggest you all do the same."
"Let's get things straight and out of the way.   Moore was *not* a strong candidate. He wasn't. He couldn't defend himself when attacked (he actually hurt himself more). He had a bad track record. He consistently said the wrong thing at the wrong time. He didn't attack issues and instead tried to coast off of image. He was a candidate destined to lose in political battlefield that we're in. He appealed largely to one demographic, and that demographic was already solid red.   What do we need?   We need to nominate smart people that can hold themselves well, that have some wit and charm. We need to nominate people that have a track record and a resume worth publishing. We need to nominate people that can appeal to *everyone* - people that fall in line with Trump's plans *and* show that they can handle a political bout without outside help. (Think the Rand Paul type.) We need to nominate people that will be loyal and people that will make a dem opponent rightfully worried.   We didn't do that with Moore. He wasn't the guy to put up.   Then we need to *fight for them*. We need to help their battle. If you're donating, consider donating directly to *their* campaign. If you live in the state, put in at least an hour or so of ground game. Go to rallies, shout your support. Put signs in your yard, spread the message that will win moderates and light blues. We need to carry the same energy that we had in the 2016 election. Post stuff, spread it on Facebook, share your thoughts around the water cooler. The blue will undoubtedly spread lies and false rumors. It is on ***you*** to defend your candidate.   We didn't do that with Moore. We left him, more or less, out in the cold.   And, most importantly, get out and ***vote***. We had lower turnout than expected because we got cocky. We shrugged off what we assumed to be a non-threat and now we're paying for it. There is zero excuse for this.   Many of us didn't do that with Moore. The blue mobilized and we let that get the better of us. We saw firsthand how organized they were - we need to show them what we can do.   We won the jackpot with Trump. That was a win that will echo through history and, honestly, was something that gave us a once in a lifetime miracle. We got in *the* guy that America needed. Now we need to make sure that he gets the tools he needs. Now we need to make sure that he can do what needs to be done.   My prediction is that this will be down voted, that some of the people that comment might write things attacking this, and that should speak volumes. This is something that the blue *knows* we need and they will not want us hearing it.    Get in the right people. Make the Dems scared that we have a juggernaut entering the arena. Rally behind them and show the blue just how much energy and organization we have. Give Trump the tools that he needs. His tweets says it all.    The fight isn't over guys, we need to be serious about this one."

How did our justice system fail Steinle and her family? How??? How did an ILLEGAL ALIEN who has been deported (crime #1) 5 times who brandished a stolen firearm (crimes #2 &amp; #3) and fired upon a crowd (WHICH HE ADMITTED TO!!!) get off? HOW!?  This is unbelievable. I am disgusted to live here. I feel alienated in my own state. It's disgusting and horrible.  Build that fucking wall. Build it for Kate.
"""Sanctuary City"" policies are proposed to theoretically decrease crime by removing fear of deportation for illegal aliens when reporting a crime. So this guy finds a stolen handgun, and has a policy in place that would allow him to report it to the authorities without penalty, and instead he picks it up like some sort of fucking toy and ends a young woman's life with it. Not only did the policy allow him to be here when it shouldn't, BUT IT FAILED AT ITS EXPLICIT INTENDED PURPOSE!!!    BUILD THAT WALL"

"Does anyone know if the Bill, Hillary and Chelsa Clinton Foundation submitted its tax forms for the ""Foundation?""  If they did submit, then that means they have to go back and amend all filings since the beginning to bring themselves in compliance and face legal ramifications  If they didn't file, then once again...they face legal ramifications.    All that is needed is one State Attorney General, or one IRS Commissioner, or one Congressman to ask some pertainent questions.  BTW, Obama has set up a ""Foundation"" following the Clinton Blueprint--totally illegal.     The Clinton Foindation only had a charter to raise money for Billy-Bobs Trailer Park Presidential Museum and Cigar Store.  Anything else was against the law.  Notwithstanding the fact that they raised money to purchase substandard aids drugs and made deals with African despots to somehow ""help"" the poor natives of that poor continent."

"For every immigrant we support in America we could support 10 people in their home country. Couple the costs. ca. 100 billion is the costs of illegal immigration/ year. Make a deal with liberals for immigration reform. We put that 100 billion into the developing aid pool. If we deport and secure the border that money will go to 3rd world people to support various projects. See IF they REALLY care about people or if they just want to destroy America. And if the 3rd world is uplifted we benefit too for trade and to limit the push factor of poverty striken people. We might make it into interest free loans, so if someone is successful there they can even pay us back and we could reinvest it. We can be humanitarian and strong at the same time."

"This article is VERY detailed in noting what FBI did NOT look at or demand as part of its investigation.  It is truly shocking. even now that we know so much more.  https://nypost.com/2016/10/25/hillarys-33000-emails-might-not-be-missing-after-all/  Most notably yet again---just like in DNC investigation--no one at FBI ever examined server or subpoenaed it or did their own investigating.  Just relying on reports from others who have skin in game and potential witnesses.  Source: http://archive.is/Dkb2z  archived from cucked Time Here is Comey talking about why Huma Abedin would send CLASSIFIED emails to her HUSBAND'S computer:  &gt;“Huma Abedin appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to him, I think to print out for her, so she could then deliver them to Secretary of State,” Comey said during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday  So Comey--the HEAD of the damned FBI---wanted us all to believe Huma, working for one of the world's most powerful figures in the most advanced country on earth, couldn't get to a printer of her own to give her boss some copies.  And that he doesn't think Weiner read them (why would he, being about to go to jail and having no reason to want dirt on others?) but he does not know bc Weiner was busy then and couldn't talk much.  And no one was ever charged even though it was ""probably"" a crime."
Because I can't wrap my head around the trial.  But I'm just a simple man.   
I think everyone would enjoy watching this sideshow and what’s the worst that happens?
"The depth and totality of the corruption of the FBI is no longer a subject for debate. It has been so profoundly politicized, that ALL of it's actions are suspect and assumed tainted. The danger that this represents to the Republic cannot be overstated.   The FBI has traditionally represented the only line of defense against corruption in the larger government as a whole. When the FBI actively engages in a coverup of larger government corruption, and seeks to manufacture evidence of corruption where none really exists, it becomes clear to the citizenry, that it can no longer be trusted to faithfully enforce the law.  The day is fast approaching, when this duty will again fall directly on the people of the United States."

But there is a critical component he cannot touch specifically because he is Trump, so we have to do it.  &amp;nbsp;  The core belief of liberals that allows them to engage in such outrageous behavior and idiotic pretzel twisted logic is that they are special and wonderful people who are fighting evil Trump and his followers, so anything goes.  &amp;nbsp;  It's our job to apply their logic back to them and attack their belief about themselves while doing it. This way they start questioning themselves. It'll be a self-made redpill that will put a chink in their constructed belief. Cause a short-circuit.  &amp;nbsp;  Just using this next example as a model because it's fresh in everyone's heads. So for example with August Ames we can say something like ""We need to shame that slut for what she's doing. Choosing not to sleep with a gay guy is discrimination. Let's keep pushing hard and jam some damn compassion into her dumb head."" &amp;nbsp;  Now, I was using that as an example because the name and situation is fresh in everyone's heads. Of course you don't want to bully anyone. But you can use the same principles in other situations. Slut shaming is SUPPOSED to be bad in their culture yet here they are doing it. Her body her choice, but not here? Pushing hard and jamming is the opposite of showing compassion. Show them their hypocrisy and pretzel logic.  &amp;nbsp;  You can do it one line at a time too if it seems to get ""bulky."" And we're all over now so don't worry someone will likely be around to point out your hypocrisy to make it more obvious for the dense and brainwashed. It'll be fun seeing people try to defend it and the better you can get the hook in the more aftershocks and red-pilling there will be.  "

... aaaaaaand the next day one of two “credible” accusers admits to forgery.  [You can’t make this stuff up.](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/08/bombshell-roy-moore-accuser-admits-forged-yearbook/) 
That way we know who they are and any cop will be able to detain them for any reason. 
"As we have seen recently, Time has decided to feature the silence breakers for their feature piece. Of course the white knights if Reddit have misconstrued this is a ""DEFIANT BLOW TO TRUMP"" and all that garbage.   With my limited knowledge (As an Aussie), I know that the silent majority are those who speak out against the sexual assault of women, and some of them happen to accuse God Emperor Trump. What those on the left fail to recognise is this is the same movement that PROTESTED BILL CLINTON'S (THE CONVICTED RAPIST) ACTIONS.  This shows how little of a moral compass those in the left have, using those who speak out about these terrible actions too suit their own needs. Disgusting."
The swamp is deep. Only POTUS has a MAGA agenda. But thank God that may be enough. 
That is all.
"Because not only do they actively pick candidates to support,  they then use their entire platforms to try and destroy their candidate's opposition.   This shit is getting old."
"While I was NOT logged in, there were 6 posts from T_D on the front page of Reddit.

"The SEC [from 2015-early 2017] alleged that Uchimoto—a former SEC lawyer and onetime general counsel to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange—played a role in a large scheme by misleading Nasdaq about whether two of stock promoter Benjamin Wey’s client companies had the required amount of shareholders to be listed on the exchange. At the time of the alleged conduct in 2008 and 2009, Uchimoto worked at Buchanan Ingersoll as chair of its China practice group. [unarchived source](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202782266516/?slreturn=20171105165850)  One such company was CleanTech Innovations which the NASDAQ unexpectedly de-listed in 2010. This action resulted in the instantaneous destruction of $200 million in shareholder wealth. [unarchived source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleantech-innovations-inc-sues-the-nasdaq-stock-market-for-racism-and-discrimination-137556588.html) The ongoing fallout in-part led to  the voluntary de-listing of dozens of Chinese-based publicly traded companies from the NASDAQ in the following years. [unarchived source](http://fortune.com/2015/07/08/chinese-companies-may-regret-going-home-to-chinas-stock-markets/) When CleanTech sued the NASDAQ in 2012 it was former senator Arlen Specter who represented the company. During this trial William Uchimoto testified in favor of CleanTech's allegations of racial discrimination within the SEC and NASDAQ against Chinese/Asian companies. The results of the trial came in July 2013 (9 months after Specter's death) and CleanTech won. [unarchived source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleantech-innovations-inc-announces-sec-decision-setting-aside-2011-nasdaq-delisting-of-cleantech-common-stock-217376641.html)  From here, things go silent until 2015 when SEC lawyers, [led by Melissa Hodgman](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2015/lr23342.htm), brought (now dismissed) charges against Uchimoto dating back to 2008 and 2009.  “I gave a deposition about a year and a half ago. That’s the last I heard from them,” Uchimoto said at the time. After two years of exhaustive legal defense a federal judge dropped the charges against Uchimoto in March 2017. [unarchived source](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202782266516/)  Important quote from that last source:   &gt;Uchimoto said he had **filed a motion with the SEC seeking sanctions against the agency and the enforcement division lawyers involved in the case against him.** He said that before Monday’s ruling, he had planned to bring the sanctions motion before the court if the SEC didn’t withdraw its claims against him.

"The /pol/ idea to colonize Myspace has got me thinking about what my ideal social media website would be like. A better version of Reddit:  &gt;Rules of website reflect US laws &amp; Constitution, Especially first amendment and supremacy clause.  &gt;You can create different type of communities (like subreddits), which have different type of rules and regulations according to the type, such as religious institution, company, non-profit organization etc.  &gt;Mods are voted on by the people. Only people who are citizens/approved members of your Community can vote.  &gt;Mods can be ousted/impeached if found to be abusing power or breaking US law or violating people's rights.  &gt;You have to state what state you actually live in (just vague enough so no one doxxes you).  &gt;There will be a community for your state (called Online State) that you are a citizen of.  &gt;You have to create account with American SSN to vote in your online state, so no one who isn't an American citizen can vote in online state elections, and you'll have to provide 2 forms of ID as well as a picture taken of you with timestamps so no one can steal your identity and use it to vote illegally (this has a check run on it 1 time to ok the account and never stored in the cloud so no hacker can obtain them. This is going to be hard to do because the website would need to check a database of the accounts to make sure no duplicates are made). This is optional but you won't be able to vote in your online state without this.  &gt;Two posting modes available: one with your username and anonymous mode. If you break US law while in anonymous mode you'll be suspended/banned or have anonymous mode disabled for an amount of time based on severity, this is to deter illegal behavior. The first amendment is protected under both modes meaning you can't be suspended just because you said something mean or stated an unpopular opinion anonymously.  &gt;Mods are given titles based on size and type of community (org, company, non-profit, online state, school etc). 100 ppl mod is sheriff, 200 mayor, 300 senator, 1000 top mod is governor/ceo/principal/headmaster etc etc  &gt;Some kind of point system to make it addictive. Debating on whether or not to allow upvote/downvote system to exist as this creates a echo chamber/hivemind environment.  &gt;Some kind of hierarchy system to make it competitive, this will make people want to spend more time on the site.  &gt;Companies will have to state themselves as such. Any post that is an ad will have to be stated as such and paid for. Depending on the amount of views/hits/impressions the ad gets the company will pay for that. The company will have to state the size of their company and how much of their budget goes towards advertising. This is to avoid having the company being targeted by trolls who share the companies ad to rack up their advertising bill and have this idea backfire. This creates revenue for the site so it doesn't have to charge it's users or force them to view ads they wouldn't normally see (I can't believe Twitter hasn't thought of this yet).  &gt;Named something murica sounding like ""HeartLand"" or ""United Online States of America"" or some shit.   This is just a general outline. I've actually been thinking about something like this for a while but I don't know the first thing about making a website.  Please post critiques and questions or further ideas to make a better Reddit."

"There are Republican Senators being quietly threatened by the agents of the CORRUPT DEMOCRAT MACHINE and/or Deep Swamp (many have skeletons, particularly if we are now going back 40 years).   Maybe the WP is doing some more investigative journalism.   Obama is saying ""who can we turn"".   Other Senators may be having big promises made to them.   Corker seems to be an example of a Senator they got to.    "

"This dude is one brave son of a bitch!  he works his ass off, he points out the corruption, he lets us know the truth, he isn't afraid to say stuff( no matter how ""insensitive"")  he calls the media out for lying. He faces opposition everyday from hollywood, the elite, bought and paid for politicians, the state, paid protesters, george soros, obama, and clinton.  He's opposed by nearly all democrats, and half of his own party as well.    Anyone who thinks this guy is laying everything on line for his own selfish interests is an idiot. Why would someone who has it all and spent his whole life being great and building an empire risk it all.    All this russia crap is exactly that crap. Its just the deep state/media trying to create something.    we the people voted for the guy...I mean the optics are everywhere.... People who are and have been consumed by football are now turning away,not buying tickets, and not supporting the NFL...Its not because these players are taking a knee and being assholes... Its because OUR president pointed it out... the people stand with our president, not against, this people who disrespect the flag.    There are countless other cases for the optics-Rally sizes, liberal comedians and trump bashing tv shows losing ratings (colbert/trevor noah/jimmy kimmel)... We are all smart enough to realize that the same people who are against the man own the media outlets...   ESPN is laying off people because of one reason.  They got a little too political...(the wrong kind of political).. you tubers are being demonetized for having pro trump/conservative views.  (diamond and silk, mark dice, paul joeseph watson, RedPill Black. )    Everything is fractal.  take a small piece of something and it tells you the truth... I can guarantee hillary didn't win the ""popular"" vote. like they say (as if that matters anyway)... you can't tell me someone who has 10000 people show up to rally only because lebron, jay z, katie perry, or beyonce was there, beat someone who had 20,000 people show up just to see the guy.    Social network numbers/following, tv ratings, product sales (Ivanka clothing line, Milo Yianopolis, Joy Villa) and tons of other stuff. Point to one thing-  We support our president.

"Bannon is taking so much flak, he must be over the target. We already know what we get when McConnell gets his puppets in place, they attack Trump and vote against Obamacare repeal. They called for Moore to drop out, but demurred on Al Franken when it was PROVEN!     We learned that McConnell would rather have a Democrat in office than a Republican they don't control. That's pretty damning.    In any case, look over the wreckage of this election for voter fraud. The election was decided by the write-ins alone, and they found a bunch of pre-filled forms for Doug Jones. These people aren't above cheating."

"For the past few years, clearing snow off the driveway has been a whole-family effort, consisting now of an old man, a middle aged woman, and three children (one of which was me) who either couldn't be bothered to help or couldn't do much once they got around to it. But no more! Trump, and the rest of this board, had inspired me to make the best of myself. Earlier this year, I took on the most grueling workout routine I'd ever done, spending upwards of 15 hours a week working out during the summer months (I'm sure this is peanuts to you high energy alphas!). Today, I cleared that damn driveway myself before the folks got home. Feels damn good. MAGA!"

"Just look at his last tweet on Tax Reform, its one of the most casual, relief filled tweets he's made.   This is what we've been waiting for boys, for things to start to normalize.   This tax cut is a big part of normalizing. People who previously thought Trump was incapable of doing anything, will continue to learn, as they continue to learn as America keeps becoming great and the stock market and GDP goes up, that he truly is a great President.   Sadly, that will only be a very small percentage of converts out of a much greater number that should have occurred, but slowly and surely more and more people will start to understand the logic of Trump and the dissonance of the Democrats. "
"Due to my complete loss of trust of all MSM for obvious reasons and the general bias here on reddit, can anyone give me some real unbiased perspectives on Brexit? I generally support the idea of an independent Britain and I kind of understand the short term consequences of pulling out of the EU and how the EU is trying to punish Britain for pulling out, but what are the lasting effects of Brexit? And are they positive or negative? Sources when necessary would be appreciated. I just can't deal with anymore liberal hysteria on anything that doesn't agree with liberal views. "

And it's ALWAYS the same dozen or so BLUE-CHECK people every time that are the first couple of comments. How do they do it? To me, it makes no sense, unless it's fucking rigged.  If the system was fair, do you know how difficult that would be to achieve? My comment got ZERO likes. It was immediately buried in the sea of comments, which is how it kind of should be.  The top BLUE CHECK comments already had 100+ likes each, in under the first MINUTE OF HIS TWEET. Something is seriously wrong here!  Do these people work? Do they sleep? Do they eat?

That's awfully funny, because just a month ago...  http://www.newsweek.com/jews-racism-trump-antisemitism-charlottesville-attacks-jewish-700398  The same damned author in the same damned publication was blaming neonazi anti-Semitism on Trump being on the right.   So let me get this straight- you accuse Trump of association with anti-Israel far right neonazis, but then when he proves you wrong by sticking up for Israel harder than any president in my lifetime, you blame him again for the anti-Israeli backlash?   What a rag. "

"Too many times have people of minorities been silenced because of their political views. No longer can ""uncle Tom"" be thrown at a black man for having certain political views the same as calling the same man a n*gg*r for having a certain skin color.   This attitude towards same groupthink amongst certain races is racism and should be touted as such. In this thought process I think it's wholly appropriate to start a social campaign geared at understanding it's not just white people that think you're stupid, the SJW narrative is universally laughed at and frowned upon. It is the holy trifecta of embarrassment for an Intellectual community.  #minoritiesthatdisagree  "
"Last week, Greenwald called out the press for its latest blunder: “Friday was one of the most embarrassing days for the U.S. media in quite a long time,” wrote Greenwald. “The humiliation orgy was kicked off by CNN, with MSNBC and CBS close behind, with countless pundits, commentators and operatives joining the party throughout the day. By the end of the day, it was clear that several of the nation’s largest and most influential news outlets had spread an explosive but completely false news story to millions of people while refusing to provide any explanation of how it happened.”"

I work for a European based company in their American Branch and just received a report from our Headquarters. We are now going to be moving all of our major operations to the United States with in the next few years and our minor ones to Eastern Europe. We have been preparing to move for months but still deciding on the locations and countrys. (Kebab infestations are making it dangerous to work in Western Europe) The announcement of the Tax Cuts though sealed the deal on which country we would move our major operations to. I would expect the announcement to go public within the next few months to a year at most as we get ready to pull out of Europe and finish existing contracts. As for a specific date for the release I couldn't say as thats up to our Corporate Office and above my pay grade.
The irony is lost with those sad bunch.
Just like in the late 40s through mid 60s when it was much more affordable to move into the suburbs outside of the high tax cities.   All those liberals might have to move back to their hometowns and gasp.. actually see their family once in awhile now. Boo Hoo 
Here we go AGAIN...
"https://youtu.be/7pYitbRkMeM?t=3426    The appropriately named song, ""Offended"", which honestly would be more fitting if it was titled ""Triggered"", features the following lyrics:    Kiss my butt (Smooch)! My set of principles is gone, BUT!//   Until I get the President to respond, my pen and pencil is a missile launcher//   #B R O K E N   #R   #O   #K   #E   #N     "
"They have painted themselves into a corner. We all know what happens when you try to cheapen or take away entitlements. Not to mention, any reduced EU military support from the US will require them to compensate with their own funds.     Trump has crippled the smug EU superiority complex in one fucking bill. "
"No, this won't result in 'internet packages.'   Tell that to the years pre-2012 and pre-net neutrality.  It will only lead into big corporations being able to invest into the American internet infrastructure, and competing with each other to offer better service, and CHARGE MORE for MORE. "
President Trump is doing a fantastic job cutting government regulations. Now its time to force business protectionist private regulators like the AMA to deregulate medical delivery to allow competition and automation alternatives to expensive doctors seeking to protect their legal monopolies.   Private regulatory bodies are now some of the greatest inhibitors of competition as they seek to protect their own margins.  Private protectionist regulatory bodies must also be forcedto implement deregulation.
"High local taxes are the way that wealthy New York libs segregate their communities. All the areas with high local taxes, are rich liberal areas that use these high taxes to prevent minorities from being able to afford houses in these neighborhoods. With the new tax plan, working families will now get a huge standard deduction towards saving for homes, and there will be pressure to keep local taxes lower. Libs here are terrified that they may actually have to live out their diversity rhetoric."
"I was working in an elementary school yesterday and noticed 3 kids in PE class with T-shirts that had a logo ""We Resist"".  I thought it was unusual for three kids to have an anti Trump shirt because that is what it appeared to be.  When I saw the back of a shirt, it had the DARE logo on the back.  DARE is the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program in schools.  I had to wonder though if there was some sort of anti-Trump sentiment and message in these shirts.  Each student at the grade level is issued a shirt. Maybe it is innocent..."
"It's been a battle for the last year, particularly after I saw him like a post in which someone got punched for talking about Pepe, the night of the Berkeley riot against MILO.   I've liked him for his stand up, down to earth lifestyle and being kind to his fans, but it's clear he doesn't respect me or anyone that voted for GEOTUS.   It's sad because other than his political beliefs (which I had known to be democrat for all these years), he's a good guy. I think he's just incredibly misguided and stupid even. I mean, he believed the dossier. Dunno if he still does. He's always been mostly unpolitically except for maybe five Obama tweets during his eight year term. I didn't expect him to be so political regarding his ""favorites"" list.   It's just stupid because I know how wrong he is. I mean this is a guy only a few years ago said that he doesn't watch that ""news shit"" but he thinks he knows better?   Half my life I've loved this guy. But i suppose it's not much a loss, since he's practically retired, now, anyway, and most of the time I've been a fan has just been a lot of waiting because I believe him to be a damn fine actor.   But it doesn't really matter to me anymore. "
I have no problem with Leftists wishing to pay the rates of the old tax code.

I am incredulous that someone could call themselves a conservative and advocate for Net Neutrality.  Just what angels would you employ to supervise the Net to insure it was neutral?  Have you not seen enough of government corruption to see the error of Net Neutrality???????

Two weeks down. Keep spreading the reminders. Grab them by the wallet.
"In the past year they’ve showed some anti-Trump bias but for the most part they keep it apolitical. I really don’t care they have differing opinions if they aren’t pushing it on their audience.   The hosts are completely enamoured with the idea of The Rock running for president. Ok fine. But this morning they were praising his character for how selfless of an act it would be for him to become pres and set aside a successful career, for a position he doesn’t need the money from, to help this country. (*gosh, why does that ring a bell?*). **Three** of them in complete agreement that a 2020 run is his best shot, hands down he’d win (*Um, not. We’re not done with MAGA yet*).  So what made my decision for me was after attributing to The Rock *exactly* what POTUS is doing now, one host says of our current president ... “What has been done? All these promises and all this time, and nothing has been done.” They are always  balanced and honest about situations they do stories on (even being all comedy), so for them to not be able to recognize a single accomplishment of this administration really took me by surprise. I’m pretty sure I would rather listen to NPR for my ride in. Such a shame. It was fun while it lasted. "
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Trump. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical memetics most of the jokes will go over a typical normie’s head. There's also Trump’s winning outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Renaissance  literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Trump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Trumps existential catchphrase ""Lock her up!"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Trump’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. �� And yes, by the way, i DO have a Trump tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��"

"There is precedent for arresting people who publish propaganda with the sole intention of undermining the government and president of the United States.  It goes all the way back to :  Benjamin Franklin Bache was editor of the Philadelphia Aurora, a Democratic-Republican newspaper. Bache had accused George Washington of incompetence and financial irregularities, and ""the blind, bald, crippled, toothless, querulous Adams"" of nepotism and monarchical ambition. He was arrested in 1798 under the Sedition Act, but he died of yellow fever before trial.[11]:27–29, 65, 96  There are many cases like this where people who could hardly be called reporters continuously published propaganda without evidence, and were charged with Sedition.    Trump needs to consider this an option as young impressionable minds are being led astray by the ignorance spouted by corporate elite hoping to keep us in line and away from their profits.    They like Illegals and H1b abuse because it drives down costs.  They sell it as globalism and welcoming our neighbors to the naive.  They like free trade because it allows them to exploit third world labor forces.  They sell it as interaction with our neighbors.  They exploit every social issue to keep our attention off of the large dollar issues that are life and death for American citizens every day.  How many times will we allow them to say ""Let them eat cake!"" and not do anything in response?  If we have evolved from that time, it is because our president will stand up and do it in our name, with our support, with the proper authority and without the need to resort to such violence.  "

"So while showing a video of a simpleton on youtube who was talking about consolidating all languages on Earth to ""Americanish"", a co-worker stated that the girl was as stupid as ""Trump"".  As I work in a very liberal college in New England, he just assumed I was a fellow Trump hater.  I asked him how exactly Trump was ""stupid"".  He immediately got all irritated and started spewing out libtard msm talking points with zero evidence.  It was all speculation, feelings, and opinion.  It was quite comical to redpill him for a solid 20 minutes on each and every issue he brought up.  He eventually said ""whatever"" and stormed out of my office.  Some people are just so brainwashed, it is really unbelievable!"

By the way, Willie Brown once came to a store at which I was working, and as I held a bag open for him to load his stuff, he deliberately angled his body to brush his crotch against my hand.

Mathis was deemed in violation of the party's bylaws for not supporting Democratic Party nominees in all special or general elections for the past four years. &gt;  &gt; Mathis was a Republican candidate for District 29 of the Alabama State Senate in 2010.

It provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts by doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, protecting tax savings for higher education and retirement, and lowering rates across the board.  &gt;2. The bill puts American businesses on a level playing field with foreign competitors. America’s corporate tax rate will go from being the highest in the developed world to below the average for Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.  &gt;3. The act will eliminate dozens of special interest tax breaks and loopholes. It tosses out a loophole used to deduct compensation for executives earning more than $1 million a year.

"Hi, slight right leaning centrist here (only right leaning after trump got elected because the left has full blown autism.) I follow trump on twitter because it’s better to get the info from what he is doing from himself instead of having his words turned by the MSM. I always see that the highest liked and retweet’d comments are from salty libtards (who are saying what would be hate speech if the right said it to a libtard, but I digress (Also, 87% of the time they are verified Twitter users) saying stuff like “F*CK U DONALD TRUMP!” And “YOU SUCK!” And every time I see this it hurts me from the inside, I know that the left could be saved from itself, but they are so stupid that they don’t even realize that they are the reason they are being crushed under their own ignorance. Instead of “tweet sniping”, the salty libtards could actually go and learn some politics and come back together with a reasonable comeback and actually make some head way. But they just can’t get a grip in the swamp they are treading.

"Excerpt from a website with a section about soy decreasing testosterone levels.  An effeminate man who has too much estrogen (caused by eating too much soy).  Soy acts as a phytoestrogen and mimics effects of estrogen in the body.   &gt; Well what about the claim of soy reducing male testosterone levels? What is the basis for that?  &gt; Answer: Soy contains these compounds called isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein) which act as phytoestrogens (plant estrogens) in the human body. They’re structurally similar to the principal female hormone, estrogen, and are believed to have similar effects in the body.  &gt; As high estrogen level in men are almost always a direct route to low testosterone levels, eating soy – which contains estrogenic compounds – is often blamed for lowering testosterone.  &gt; But is that really what happens in the human body? Let’s see what science says:  &gt; a) Dr. Kenneth D.R. Setchell from Colorado State University, discovered this small molecule called equol from humans back in 1982. Since then he has been researching the molecule.

Back in 2004, Dr. Setchell found out that [equol is a strong anti-androgen, which can almost completely shut down the activity of dihydrotestosterone (the most potent androgen)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681200?dopt=Abstract).  &gt; b) [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21353476) followed one 19 year old man who started consuming hefty amounts of soy in his diet. Suddenly the guy lost all interest to sex and suffered from erectile dysfunction. His blood DHEA, testosterone, and DHT levels also plummeted significantly. 1 year after stopping the soy consumption, his erectile health and hormonal profile was fully regained  &gt; c) [In this human study](http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/11/2584.short), from 99 infertile men, the men that ate the most soy had the lowest sperm count.  &gt; d) [In this study](http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/5/10/785.short), soy protein increased the number of epithelial cells in the breast tissue by 29% (this is a sign of overblown estrogen).  &gt; h) These three animal studies [[this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11431339), [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11577007), and [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11694625) found out that the isoflavones in soy can cause breast cancer (another sign of overblown estrogen).  &gt; i) [In this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7892297) the researchers found out that male infant rats who received soybean feed when they were still in womb, had problems in sexual organ developement. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10828262) also found out similar effects.  &gt; j) [In this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15735098), soy protein decreased testosterone and DHT levels in healthy young men.  &gt; NOTE: There are few studies which show no major differences in testosterone levels after soy consumption. However they’re quite often sponsored by SOYJOY® or other large soy producers. Meaning that the results are of no use and often completely biased.

"""When the thugs of Europe’s People’s States snarl that you are guilty of _intolerance_, because you don’t treat your desire to live and _their desire to kill you_ as a difference of opinion-you cringe and hasten to assure them that _you are not intolerant of any horror._ When some barefoot bum in some pesthole of Asia yells at you: _How dare you be rich_, you apologize and beg him to be patient and promise him _you’ll give it all away_."""
"Donald Trump and Obama ended up in the same barber shop. Each being worked on by a different barber, not a word was spoken.  The barbers were even afraid to start a conversation, for fear it would turn to politics.  As the barbers finished their shaves, the one who had Obama in his chair reached for the aftershave. Obama was quick to stop him saying, ""No thanks, my wife Michelle will smell that and think I've been in a whorehouse all day.""  The second barber turned to Trump and said, ""How about you sir?""   Trump replied, ""Go ahead; my wife doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse smells like."" "
Just heard on the radio that it “wasn’t terror related”..... okay..
"Pedes, tonight, on this Christmas Day I humbly ask you for your prayers. My dad, a fellow Trump supporter, a veteran, and my hero, is passing into God's arms. It has been a long fight with the cruel bitch that is cancer.  The end is near. Please pray for my mother who has been by his side for 65 years. Please pray for my older brothers and sisters, and each of their children. And if I may, please pray for me, his youngest child and my little family. I’ve been preparing for this day for some time and yet, in this moment, I feel totally unprepared for the days ahead and the void that will soon exist and I don't know where else to turn.  This place has given me so much comfort since November of 2016, and I’m leaning on you once again. May God bless you all and I thank you for your prayers.   Update: Dad passed this morning. I want to thank each and every one of you who helped me through this week. Your kindness astounds me. Thank you from the very bottom of my heart. "
"Few important points:  - More than this one senate seat, we want national voting elections to be cleaned up so only eligible voters actually vote.    - The federal government should not allow any state to destroy any voting data.  Period!  - Trump got roughly same votes as this whole special election, and Trump endorsed a candidate.  - This will be closely evaluated by federal voting folks to see what all happened and why votes cast are marked for deletion.  - Think 5d...   there are thousands and thousands of sealed indictments and many speculate that some of those are for sitting members of Congress.  Why else would Trump let this slide?  He knows who’s about to be locked up and will find another hill to fight on.  And Moore’s kind of a creep for being in his 30’s and dating girls carrying around high school yearbooks."

"Republicans can't win because they need Trump in the primaries but cannot win in the general election - because he is not on the ballot.  The current upturn was a Christmas present from Obama in 20016 as the Obama Recovery continues..  Trumps criticisms of the press, the FBI and CIA are totally off-base and undermining American's confidence in our core institutions. He is a dangerous autocrat that must be stopped."

I explained that it's only a joke to the liberals who do a happy dance in the comment section when it happens. To us, it just adds to the slander that he and we face on the daily. I'm now stuck in a debate with some libshevik about the tax plan and religious freedom and being slandered for being triggered. I just love how liberals equate what they do with us being angry about being consistently and without fail called stupid, or evil, or whatever."

When will it all end..."
"So, I've never given much thought to politics previous to this last year or so (between ages 18-23, I went through some serious problems &amp; spent more time wasted on pills, going through drug rehabilitation &amp; trying to keep sober than keeping up with current events; I'm currently 26), &amp; I've near always been of the idealistic sort of opinions concerning politics. Without considering the logistics, I felt that healthcare and college for all would be a great next step for our country, &amp; felt strong repulse for the perception that Mr. Trump wanted to build a wall to keep out those that make our country what it is today: a cultural melting pot. I bore witness to a plethora of violent, hateful human beings in attendance of rallies and conventions.   =To specify, I never identified as Democratic, but tended lean towards it, while agreeing with certain Republican ideals as well. =  Over the last year and a half I've learned much more about the way a country actually works.   •I still believe that college for all would be a good opportunity for us as Americans, but I've learned more about the amount of resources, money &amp; manpower such a feat would require, not to mention the fact that people often take advantage of opportunities that they were given, &amp; not worked for.   •I've learned that the idea behind the wall has far more to do with due diligence &amp; process when handling immigrants coming here, and that it has nothing to do with Xenophobia and everything to do with the safety of the American citizen.   •I've seen how an off-handed, shit-talky ""Grab her by the pussy"", something not unlike the racy comments I've dropped amongst my friends, doesn't hold a candle to the reality of sexual abuse &amp; assault that is taking us by a storm over the last few months.   •I've grown to understand that, while I may not always agree with some of the comments the man makes, that Mr. Trump has genuinely good intentions for the country, &amp; that the media portrayal of his achievements can be discovered to be false with a bit of my own digging and researching. Brash honesty is far greater than veiled sincerity backed by ill intentions.   •I've realized that in leu of reporting on the average, sensible, and level-headed Republican citizen, that most media will instead target the most bigoted, hateful &amp; ill-intentioned examples they can to a make the vocal minority representative of the entire political party as a whole.   •I also learned that, while there are heavily publicized accounts of people being violent or unruly at conventions and speeches, that those examples are representative of less than one percent of the political party in which they align. People are quick to say ""not all feminists"" but selectively exclude the same level of empathy when dealing with Republicans and Trump supporters. They tend to overlook the examples against their liberal counterparts, as well.  •Until I took independence in my understanding of our political climate, I instead accepted misinformation from my numerous liberal-minded friends and colleagues. I let my agreement on matters such as sexual identity &amp; acceptance of those different then ourselves take the place of self-education and diligent research.    I've learned a lot, but still have plenty more to discover, and therefore decided to introduce myself to every other like-minded individual populating this page, in the hopes of expanding my understand more and more.   Thanks for reading my enormous post, and I'm glad to meet y'all ��"
Donald Trump taunts Andrew McCabe on twitter. Very strong signal that Sessions has the goods on him. The storm is here!
Virtually every State University System was started to provide free college education to any student qualified to get in. Now none do. Now they are all bloated bureacracies serving only their employees and administrators yet still taking state money pretending to exist for the public good. This needs fixing.  Seriously. Most dont even serve their basic fundmental reason for existing anymore. They need to be scrapped and new ones started with the original purpose.   I dont know what can be done on a federal level but at least the issue should get national attention across state lines so some forces can be mustered strong enough to defeat the individual state university bureacracies.
One veteran suicide is too many and this post is in no way saying that the issue is dead or needs no further attention.   I just would like to share an observation.   I served as a rifleman in the marines and spent almost two full years in combat. I lost a lot of friends and had even more receive life altering injuries. I even had to use my rifle on numerous occasions.  Since my last deployment to Afghanistan in 2009 I have had my share of ups and down. Some very dark times. I have lost around 15 close friends to suicide.   It was very hard to justify the suffering I endured in Iraq and Afghanistan. As well as every day.  Obama basically told us to go fuck our selves and did things to ruin or lessen the benefits we earned.  He even said they were just welfare.   Now the positive part.   Trump ran and I saw a glimmer of hope. I never thought he'd beat the swamp like he did but then he did. Then he proved time and time again that America and most Americans ARE grateful of our sacrifices.  This completely changed my outlook on life and I've noticed that my friends mental health isn't as big of an issue any more as well.  It's amazing how having a president who loves the country you sweat and bled for is.   It's not a crime to be a vet. Or to love your country. I feel like this is just another issue that has changed so much for the better and doesn't get the publicity it deserves.   
 All around the USA they are now spending millions more in security measures and limiting your access and bags because liberals refused to stop dangerous islamic immigration especially in cucked NY and Washington Dc and Las Vegas and more. Remind them what they have cost us.
The liberal tears are flowing! Bonuses for all!!!
Not a bad way to start the day.
"The wealthy and celebrities giving that type of chump change to people in need. The world would be a beautiful place. Really $4,000,000 was nothing to her but bribe money? Damn!"
"Sad admission: ISIS has been covered so little in the news, that I don't actually understand what actions DJT took to hasten their demise.  My centrist friend is arguing that Obama put a lot of the groundwork in place for destroying ISIS.  My reaction was: in the fall of 2016, every political candidate and media talking head agreed ISIS was a huge threat.  15 months later, and ISIS is routed.  It can't be coincidence that such massive progress was made when electing a POTUS that actually loves this country and projects strength.  Pedes, teach me what changes were made.  What did Trump do differently, and why was it successful."
"We need to make sure we don't let these illegals stay in this country, especially after how they treated the God Emperor.  No DACA.  Deport every last one of them.  They are not welcome.  They hate Trump and hate our constitution and laws.  Get rid of them.  They have to go back."
It looks like unlike Obummer Trump's backing up Haley's speech with actual actions. America is back in so many ways!

"In a letter to Congress President Trump declared a national emergency concerning the threat to the United States from corruption and human rights abuses. It appears to be an expansion and or clarification of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.  Its all very interesting but the part that really jumped out at me was this section:    “The order blocks the property and interests in property of persons listed in the Annex to the order. It also blocks the property and interests in property of any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General:   (1) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse;   (2) to be a current or former government official, or a person acting for or on behalf of such an official, who is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in:   (a) corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery; or   (b) the transfer or the facilitation of the transfer of the proceeds of corruption”   This appears to single out US politicians. Is this the first step to actually cleaning up Washington?  Something definitely seems to be going on.... is this the signal?

Donald Trump Wins US Presidency.  A company expanding their workforce because of his win hired me. Then, they hired my wife. I was able to withdraw from SNAP assistance and fully support my own family.  We've been able to bounce back financially and were about to give our 3 children an amazing Christmas. I was told Friday that when I go back to work it'll be under a new wage. A better one.  Donald Trump has done more for me than any other US President. God bless him, his family and his supporters.

"First things first, I want to note that I have been watching SportsCenter and ESPN since I was a kid. Started finding it entertaining a couple years ago and now it's just completely unwatchable. Was watching the FSU-Southern Miss game, and they literally spent 3:45 (football halftimes are 15 minutes) on commercials for SportsCenter. Apparently their new ad campaigns are purely focused on their most well known program. This show is no longer about sports of course. Nowadays, it's the politics, the obnoxious talking heads that aren't even in the same world as Stuart Scott. Nobody was really talking about how bad ESPN has gotten though. That is, until they went after Trump and talked politics and complained about police. Now, projections have them going below Disney's red line by 2021, and many think sooner. #TheLeftAlwaysLoses"

And you think about all the celebrities like Rosie, and all those women on the show that with Rosie made fun of him new him personally, how all those Arrogant MSM talking heads like Wolf Blitzer and matt lauer, who had seen an arrogant, crazy eccentric weird talking business who goes on slightly immature but hilarious rants against other celebrities, uses foul demeaning language and talks in a way that if you didnt know was a billionaire youd think he was stupid that all those elites new him personally and thought of him as a joke who luaghed at the idea that he was running he became president.  There reactions.  It is just glorious"

"Can we just take a moment to remember that China is not our friend?    Can we just remember for a sec that every trade we make with them enriches them and allows them to build up their war machine to entrench fucking communism.  The reason they offer cheap labor, is to get us to remove our capability as a manufacturing power.    Cheap labor looks good monetarily but is fucking awful from a national security standpoint, considering that manufacturing IS national security."
"Great gift- although I think he may want to read them as well, but the question is, do I leave them casually lying around my living room to trigger leftie visitors, or just put them on the shelf?"
"Ran into one of my friends from childhood at a party last night, very early in the evening... the first thing is says is:  ""CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS RACIST PRESIDENT?""  I replied with a simple question... ""How is he racist?""   Smile went away, eyes bulged, jaw dropped... my friend put his face in his hands. His entire demeanor changed and he started speaking very slowly and with simple words like I was a child ""fifty, I do not have any specific examples. But I want you to know that everyone in America is NOT ok with his policies.""   ""Which policies in particular?""   And that was the last time I talked to him... stayed away from me all night.  "

B) Gender and sex are the same thing.  C) There are two sexes.  D) Sexual orientation isn't sex or gender.  E) You are the gender that you're born as.  F) Gender dysphoria is a disorder.  I also get a big kick out of watching the same folks who argued against these facts struggle and fail with the finals. That's all. MAGA on.  Edit: Also, you'd be pleased to know that the deeper you get into medical programs, the more based people you meet."
"I understand the basic premise of it, but isn't the most popular theory that Seth Rich who worked for the DNC, leaked the emails to Wikileaks? If that's true, then couldn't Wikileaks show proof that Seth Rich was the one who leaked it and not ""muh Russian agents"" "

"Hate crime is how they will force Sharia on us.  Some guy put a picture of a cross on the fence of mosque property, and the cops are looking for info on the dude in relation to a hate crime, ""bias incident"". What is a bias incident and when did those laws get passed?  youtu.be/W4njQnP6WCU  I think we should start talking methods of safely and securely spamming them with images of Jesus. They don't have an issue with Jesus, they have an issue with him, or any holy figure being depicted.  But these people get a little crazy and hate crimes, even fucking fake ones, are no laughing matter. No need for senseless casualties.  Online, we can do it safely, unless you're in Europe, in which case maybe VPNs or TOR could help you.  IRL, you don't want to mail using your real address, your handwriting, an envelope run through a laser printer at any point after you purchase it, or use any printed papers from a printer that can be tied back to you in any way, remember how they got Reality Winner.  When dropping it off, be mindful of any cameras in the area if in the city. Better that they get images of you disguised up than your license plate. Park the car, and take a stroll. Lower population density, lower prevalence of digital security measures to trip you up.  Also, no meat, urine, shit, bodily fluids etc. That's bio-hazard. Through the federal mail service, so it's a federal felony, which means you do minimum 80% before parole, with the inevitable hate crime which doubles the sentence, you'll be fucked for life for sending bio-hazard through the mail. Not the hill you want to die on.  And it doesn't have to be too offensive, these people operate on a hair trigger. Probably piss them off just having the kafir sending them mail.  You can also send edited versions of the koran. So they know what's acceptable and what's not, because no ones ever done that for them .  Get creative.  Think of it in terms of creating wildly offensive content tailored to what they find offensive, and less so westerns. Think of it as though you may have to defend this act of political, social and religious protest and free speech that some Orwellian useful dhimmwits will undoubtedly label hate speech and islamoxenabigophobicist. But fuck them and fuck that.  This is our right. And we will not see it torn from us.  We need to draw attention to this insidious ass shit that we haven't really been paying attention to. We need to do so in ways so innocent yet subtly offensive so that when they inevitably come at us with their tired shtick, maybe, just maybe, they'll finally jump the shark.  How To Be Haram  1. Appropriate Islamic calls to prayer. Create fake, and very offensive prayers in Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, etc &amp; send them to non-muslum Regressive Leftist &amp; Normie outlets and encourage them to play them during Ramadan, EID, Jannah or Friday afternoon prayers, in order to increase diversity &amp; inclusion. These will trigger any native speakers and will likely result in a media kerfuffle that will force people to start analyzing translations of all prayers in order to prevent future trolling. This will open people's eyes to what is really being said in these prayers when we, as a society, must start translating them in order to prevent from offending the Mohamedites. You can even play a little Russian roulette, send them 6 prayers with only 1 being the triggerfest.  2. Hojabis - Turn the hijab into a symbol of slutty sexiness, to coincide with World Hijab Day on Feb 1st. Across Mohamedan propaganda sites, you will see memes of women in make up and western clothes wearing the hijab. Only to be met with many comments from muslims males chastising the girl for not being or doing hijab correctly, promoting the niqab and burka, etc. The foundational claim for the hijab is modesty. So lets make a symbol of immodesty, a la Mia Kalifa.  3. Establish a Kekistani Branch of Islam as a haven for Ex-Muslums to gather, organize and socialize safely without threat of doxxing @ KFRnet.org Dr. Bill Warner's Islam action forum.  4. Make Viral a ""Burkas for Feminists"" campaign, to better foster cultural understanding of the women in Islam oppressed by Right-Wing Abrahamic Patriarchy, and to embrace the coming cultural enrichment.  5. Attribute Islamist / Jihadist Violence, Sex Crimes, etc, to Christians to open the minds of the cognitively dissonant and allow them to generate the feelings of outrage at everything Christian, and then shock the base of their ideology by revealing everything they had been angry at Christians for doing the moment prior was, in actuality, done by the Mohamedites they champion.  6. Create an Anonymous style support group for survivors of Islamic violence, from assault to rape to terrorism.  7. Make viral Memes educating Normies of all the various types of institutional forms of Islamic deception: Taqiya, Tawriya, Kitman &amp; Muruna  8. Create Memetics designed to encourage leftists in league with Islam to adopt for themselves the term of Dhimmi. I.E., ""Fight the Toxic Masculinity, Patriarchy &amp; be a Muslim ally by becoming a Emasculated Dhimmi."" Similar to how they initially embraced ""cuck"".  9. Formulate a dedicated campaign to educate young kids, especially girls, about the dangers of the Cult of Mohamed. They have a penchant for targeting children, so we need to influence culture and society in ways that give youngsters the initial ""First Impression"" akin to that of ""Stranger Danger"" and the stereotypical guy in a van handing out candy if you help him find his dog. Educate the youth before the predators and their allies in the globalist school system can propagandize them.  10. The Mohamedan Ideology teaches it's adherents to smile at our faces with hatred in their hearts. This fits well with their displayed tendencies towards isolation, supremacism and proclivity for cry-bullying tactics. I believe that this tactic should be appropriated to better circumvent persecution under Orwellian and pernicious hate speech/crimes legislation against those who speak the truth about the Cult of Mohamed. We must develop better subtext and nuance of speech to better walk the legal tightrope whilst fighting to educate people about the real purpose and effective use of ""Hate"" legislation in order to walk back their deleterious effects on liberty.  11. Calling Islam by its proper term, Mohamedanism, Cult(ists), Mohamedans, Mohamedites, Islam means, ""Peace through submission to the will of Allah"". Muslim means, ""One who walks in the path of the One True God"". Now certainly we can understand why they would use such propagandizing term for themselves, but why do we, as non-'Muslims', use their preferred terminology that only re-enforces their narrative unbeknown to us?  12. Community compilation of a comprehensive list of Islamist / Dhimmi Apologist Groups, Networks, Pundits, Activists, Arguments &amp; Communities across the West for categorized collection and dissemination of the reality narrative to counter Cultural Taqiya.  13. Advocate for full cultural immersion by making the koran mandatory reading and studying in high school. It will force the Regressivists to oppose it on a freedom from religion and church/state seperation perspective, which strengthens those protections, or to back it in favor of the sheer diversity points. Little realizing that a solid reading of the koran is one of the quickest ways to red pill westerners on Islam. And we get to one-up them in virtue signaling.  14. Pocket mister spray bottles filled with light oil diffused with bacon grease, for coating halal food sections with a slightly greasy film with a delicious bacon aroma. Be mindful of cameras and repetitive behavior. Carry in long sleeve shirt for best concealment and quick, inconspicuous use.  15. Orchestrate coordinated 911 calls to cops in neighborhoods that have to deal with intrusive daily prayer calls blasted on loudspeakers. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  16. Placing Mohamedan books on the bottom shelf. For them, Islam must always dominate, which is why they generally make a point of putting their holy books on the highest most self, or at least above the books of other religions. So, put them on the bottom shelf and check back periodically to make sure they remain there.  17. Islamic rugs that insult while being seemingly pro-Islamic, gifted to Islamophiles and apologists.  18. Generate opposition to Halal meat preparation on the basis of animal rights and animal cruelty. We need graphic A/V footage or pictures documenting the process of bleeding them out.  19. Dogs are Halal in Islam. Any religion that preaches hatred towards Man's Best Friend is certainly a false and inferior retrograde religious ideology.  20. Passing off Haram items &amp; practices as Halal to fool new converts.  21. Wine Vinegar is Haram as long as its not naturally aged and has turned to vinegar. Cooking with alcohol is also Haram.  22. It's Haram for Mohamedan men to wear silk, and other fabrics seen as feminine. It's seen as imitating women. Metrosexuality is seen as a manifestation of homosexuality.  23. It's Haram for Mohamedites to take employment in fields or companies that deal in supporting counter-Islamic initiatives, groups &amp; agendas. Companies who donate a percentage of profits to fund counter-Islamic movements would make themselves Haram to Mohamedans.  24. Support Myanmar in their efforts to defend themselves from centuries of muslim agression.  HATE CRIMES / HATE SPEECH / BIAS INCIDENTS / INCITEMENT TO HATRED  The opening story was of a mosque that had a picture of Jesus on the cross placed on it's fence, a respectful one too. Cops got involved looking for info on the person who left it on outside of the property fence. No trespassing. No vandalism. No intimidation. No destruction of property. No theft. Just a picture of Jesus, not even Mohamed, left hanging on their fence. I can only imagine how low the crime rate is in that town that they can devote manpower to looking into a case that, at best, would result in nothing more than a trumped up, misdemeanor littering charge. Just like I can imagine Martin Luther being arrested by the Church for...littering.  They claim it's offensive for any holy figure in their religion to be depicted, which includes the figureheads of Christianity &amp; Judaism. They don't get to appropriate the outrage reserved to the religions that their cult is plagiarized from.  Trigger them with truth. Truth they can't refute. Write letters that inflame muslim emotions in such a way as to make them great for victimhood currency, but so damaging to the facade of perfection bestowed upon Prophet Mo that they dare not cash in their hate mail for victimhood currency. Put them in no-win situations.  In many ""free"" western societies, we find ourselves increasingly beset by the polite tyranny of evermore nebulous ""Hate Crime"" legislation, along with it's derivatives, ""Hate Speech"", ""Bias Incidents"" &amp; ""Incitement"". In many jurisdictions, if a person purchases a koran and desecrates it, puts it in the mail and sends it to a mosque, this expression of protest against a religious and political ideology worthy of protest, is seen as a commission of a hate crime.  Across Europe, we are seeing the deleterious effects on the ability to speak truth to power of these well-intentioned &amp; misguided laws. People being arrested for posting videos of koran burnings. Homes being raided over social media posts. A man sentenced to a year in prison for putting a ham sandwich on the stoop of a mosque. He died of unknown circumstances 6 months into his prison sentence over a ham sandwich and a perceived insult to Islam. Sharia, by any other name.  Ask yourself, if you came across a koran, partially destroyed, laying on the ground in a park, how would respond? Go about your day and ignore this obvious and blatant attempt to incite hatred? If a muslim were to come across it because you just left it there and went about your day, it could get people killed. Do you pick it up and put it in the garbage bin, like you would any other half destroyed book? As if it were just some piece of trash you can throw in the garbage? How can you simply toss into the trash a book revered by 1.7 billion muslims without insult? Do you give it to a local mosque? What if they think you're the one who did it? Some of these folks are migrants with English being a second or third language. Factor in the high emotions of a destroyed koran and you could easily find yourself in a dangerous situation having only tried to do the right thing. Perhaps slipping it in the mail is the best option? With a note clearly stating you found said destroyed koran and were wanting to safely get it to those who will properly dispose of it with the respect it deserves?  It should be noted, the 'code' for disposing of worn-out or destroyed korans is similar to that of disposing of a flag. One primary means being cremation. Ceremonial burning with a little mumbled mumbo jumbo and it's like a little koran funeral. Which makes throwing them in the garbage a sacrilege, which can easily cause offense and be interpreted as inciting hatred, which would be a violation of many these statutes.  Editing the koran for correct usage in Western Societies. Let's be honest, no one has ever really done this for them. We haven't gone through their holy books with a sharpie &amp; razor blade and redacted the parts that stand antithetical to our values and social norms. Creative editing for the current year is one method of turning a potential charge for incitement to hatred through desecration of a religious text into a generally protected right to political and religious discourse and demonstration. Be sure to do it under the guise of social justice. Because hey, even the most ardent right winger looks like a social justice warrior compared to the Islamists and Jihadists.  Some folks like to send in korans soaked in urine, blood, bacon grease, bacon, pork chops, lard, scat, and so on. The issue with much of these is that of sending known bio-hazards through the postal system. Meat and blood rot, carry, generate and transmit diseases, urine and scat also transmit diseases. Bacon grease and lard are about the only ones that don't rot, and don't generally grow pathogens. Given the hyper-partisan social climate, seeing trumped up charges of bio-terrorism with a hate crime enhancement is only a question of when, no longer if. Damaging enough of the book with a razor, marker, torn pages, paint, anything to render it useless will be sufficient substitute for desecration via pork.  Addressing the issue of mixing pork products with anti-Islam demos, why is it used? Because one of the most commonly known muslim tropes is their aversion to everything pig &amp; pork. This is why mixing pork and Islam has become a recipe for hate charges. And these incidents run the gambit from benign bias incidents such as ham sandwiches left on the doorsteps of a mosque and pig greased korans being sent to mosques, to more serious issues of severed pigs heads and property crimes like B&amp;E, vandalism, arson, etc. It's meant to cause offense and outrage, and express disapproval and opposition to the Islamic ideology. It's a blunt political and religious statement. One that I think is protected, or should be. But it doesn't offer anything to the conversation, besides giving the Islamophiles an opportunity to grandstand and pontificate how horrible we are whilst the muslims get to cash in with freshly minted victimhood currency. Now don't get me wrong, there is a place for these types of blatant and offensive forms of directed protest. If for no other reason than to preserve the right to do so and stop the encroachment of hate legislation against free expression.  But instead of triggering their Islamic sensibilities with flagrant outrage, trigger them with facts, arguments, and evidence that they can not dismiss so easily. In letters that accompany pictures of Mohamed, or a destroyed koran. Letters that when read, will get out the arguments and reasoning behind our opposition to Islam to the normies hearing it. Use the momentum of the predictable outrage to piggyback the message you really want to send.  Don't let your digiprints betray you. Google has reverse search engine tools that can break down searches to specific geographic locations based on IP addresses and Meta-Data, not to mention whatever info they have on you. Your online history can be used against you in court, used to paint you in a certain light and get a conviction, guilty or not. It can also be the catalyst for an investigation instead of just a byproduct of one. One method of defensive disinformation is to maintain social media accounts openly linked to you expressing PC opinions. Things that can't be used against you, but that you can use as reasonable doubt in case of a criminal case. And maintain anonymous accounts for Memetic Warfare. Paid VPNs and Tor would be your best bet to secure those features. Public WIFI is an option to increase anonymity, but safeguard your device with a firewall. Using a laptop or desktop with a better secured operating system would also drastically increase security. Privatize your settings on all social media accounts. Anti Islamic posts made by members of the community may be the target pool for an initial fishing expedition by lazy investigators looking for flashy evidence for a show trial to secure re-election.  Be weary of cameras. Cover yourself. Scout the area, though be mindful that digitalization of cameras makes storage space cheap, don't expose yourself or identifying features like license plates while scouting, or at least don't do so in any conceivable way that stands out of normal everyday traffic as well as putting time in between scouting and action. Traffic cams. ATM cams. Private security cams. Phone cameras. Game cameras. Satellite cameras. High-Altitude Metropolitan Reverse Time-line Snapshot Cameras (They take high-altitude photos every 30 seconds - all day, every day - in order to backtrack the course of events after an 'Incident' and identify the the origins and networks of the targets.)  Sending in Polaroids of the abuse of the koran is another method of safe disrespect. But be weary of leaving a paper trail buying Polaroids as it is now a specialty tech than can be used to cross reference and narrow you down."
"Can the FBI be charged with making false statements to the American people?  What a fucking joke this is.  The Dems have overplayed their hand once again.  Now Fusion GPS, Comey, and all other swamp creatures can be charged with the same thing.  Bastards."
Any more examples? This is a group of radicalized people who turn on their heroes as long as they go against their narrative and politics.

"Hola fellow pedes!  So I've been hashing it out on twitter today, and I keep seeing these same couple of articles floating around.  Apparently the defense for jackass is that he picked up a gun in a shirt and it just ""went off"" 3 times.  Utterly ridiculous.  The gun that killed Kate was a Sig Sauer P239 in .40S&amp;W that belonged to Bureau of Land Management Ranger John Woychowski.  This is important.  The Sig P239 is a single stack DA/SA pistol with a 7 round magazine.  It is typically not issued as a primary duty weapon, and in fact in the [article](http://abc7news.com/ranger-testifies-on-theft-of-gun-used-in-steinle-shooting-in-sf/2571467/) it specifies it was his secondary duty weapon.  Sarah Rumpf put out a piece entitled, [Have We Been Lied to About the Kate Steinle Case?](https://www.redstate.com/sarah-rumpf/2017/11/30/lied-kate-steinle-case/) on Nov 30.  In the piece she relies heavily on an [article](http://www.sfexaminer.com/guns-history-accidental-discharges/) in the SF Examiner that was written by Matt Gonzalez.  This is the **SAME Matt Gonzalez** who is the Public defender of Kate's killer Garcia Zarate.  In Gonzalez's article, he cites several examples of Sig Sauer pistols having accidental or negligent discharges.  Thing is, the Sig P239 is **not usually issued as a carry gun**.  That it's bigger brother, the P226, which is a double stack 9mm that's served with the Navy SEALs and many other police departments and military units world wide.  You'll notice in Gonzalez's article he never specifies a model on any of those citations?  NOT ONCE.  Patterico put out an article piggybacking off of Rumpf piece, [Lawsplainer: The California Homicide Statutes Relevant to the Steinle Murder Case](https://www.redstate.com/patterico/2017/12/01/lawsplainer-california-homicide-statutes-relevant-steinle-murder-case).  In it he gives the same apologetic spiel Rumpf gives, probably because I would wager neither one of them knows jack shit about firearms.  As was pointed out in sub earlier, an [expert](http://www.sfexaminer.com/gun-linked-kate-steinle-killing-fires-trigger-pulled-expert-testifies/) testified that the P239 was in good working order and the firing pin block safety would have prevented the gun from firing WITHOUT SOMEONE PULLING THE TRIGGER. Additionally, the Jury requested to test the trigger and the [Judge](http://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Jury-reaches-verdict-in-killing-of-Kate-Steinle-12396509.php) Samuel K. Feng said no.  Turns out the defense was able to bamboozle the Jury because of Gonzalez's straight up bullshit article, an overwhelming lack of gun knowledge, and a hostile Judge."
"Michael Flynn is a registered Democrat who worked for the Obama White House under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  From Wiki: In September 2011, Flynn was promoted to Lieutenant General and assigned as assistant director of national intelligence in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. On April 17, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Flynn to be the 18th director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.[21][22] Flynn took command of the DIA in July 2012.[23] He simultaneously became commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and chair of the Military Intelligence Board.  Flynn went on to serve as National Security Adviser for the Trump transition team for 24 days. During that 24 days Flynn met with Russian ambassadors  as well as many other foreign agents, which is common practice for a high level national security appointee. For some unexplained reason Flynn then lied to Trump about his meetings, got fired, and then lied to the FBI. There was nothing illegal about his meetings, the only apparent crime seems to be the fact that he lied about it.  We know also that Hillary and her campaign have admitted to meeting with Ukrainian officials during the campaign to discuss how they could get rid of Trump. They have admitted to this. This is a crime. There is no investigation into this. There are no charges being filed. Nobody cares.  Based on these facts, the most logical conclusion I can come to is that Flynn was an agent of the Clinton campaign, put in place as a contingency plan to frame the Trump campaign, or at least draw suspicions of Russian ties, if he could not directly implicate Trump for any crimes. Failing to directly tie any crimes to Trump his last course of action was to lie about the meetings which were not only perfectly legal, but not even out of the ordinary, in order that the lie itself would create the public perception that there were crimes.  I don't expect him to get any jail time, but I would be willing to bet he gets a nice new house in the Canary Islands courtesy of The Clinton Foundation."
I just wanted to wish you all a Merry Christmas and I will see you all in the new year.

"The tax plan discussions inspired this thought.  Why do colleges have grad students teach instead of professors?  They obviously can't provide as good of an education.    If the past 15 years is any indication, colleges are flourishing.  Yet they still lean heavily on grad students as a labor pool.     All this talk of how they are being hurt doesn't address a bigger question: is it a good system in the first place?  I don't believe it is for these reasons:   * Grad students are inexperienced and overburdened compared to full-time professors   * They work for much less money than professors, devaluing their labor  * They are often foreigners performing jobs Americans could do  * College revenues have skyrocketed in the past two decades so money isn't the issue  * College administrator salaries and positions are bloated similar to charities  While I understand that grad student-teachers themselves aren't at fault, I believe that this is the most effective way to eliminate the program in a way that can't be easily circumvented.   Just my $.02, what's yours?"
"If I kill someone, accidentally or otherwise, during the commission of a crime, am I guilty of homicide?  For example, if I am in a country illegally, against that country's laws, and a gun ""goes off by itself"" while I'm holding it and the bullet kills someone, did was that a death during the commission of a crime?"

The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this."

"She played us all. She was the Ultimate brigade, to go inside our movement, to try and sabotage it.  We cannot blame ourselves, nor should we. I think we were getting shit on so hard from the MSM and the Left, early on in President Trump's presidency, that when she came out in the dress at the Grammys, that we saw a glimpse of hope for the future.   I think we should continue to embrace the people that come to our movement, and don't let her taint the waters of actual people actually wanting to come to it.   But we need to do what President Ronald Reagan said all the time... ""Trust but Verify""  Now I get to say to her, my favorite thing on here, that I have written on countless posts... She's a cuck."
"(see my commentary after this passage)   [Genesis 5:3-32 KJV] And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.   And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.   And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.   And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel: And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.   And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.   And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.   And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.   And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech: And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.   And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.   And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.   I've never commented after the passages I post, but I believe this one to be a rare exception.   The lineage seems dry and boring, until you look at the meanings of these 10 Hebrew names (Adam to Noah) :   Adam: Man  Seth: Appointed  Enosh: Mortal  Kenan: Sorrow  Mahalalel: The Blessed God  Jared: Shall come down  Enoch: Teaching  Methuselah: His death shall bring  Lamech: The Despairing  Noah: Rest, or comfort.  To put it together: Man (is) appointed mortal sorrow; (but) the Blessed God shall come down teaching (that) His death shall bring (the) despairing rest.  In other words, the prophecy of Jesus was *hidden* in these ten names.!  [source] (http://www.khouse.org/articles/1996/44/)  EDIT: formatting"

Deport them ALL.   ALL means ALL.
 imagine for a minute that what comey did with Hillary did  to Trump.  James Comey gave all of Hillary Clinton staffers immunity and interviewed nobody. Imagine if that was Trump. Imagine if the FBI gave every member of Trumps Administration complete immunity. Imagine if they gave me Michael Flynn Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr immunity and didn't even question them. And then interviewed Trump for 1 hour where he doesn't say anything and declared the investigation over. That's what they did to Hillary.  Just like flynn hillarys it staffer lied to the fbi.  Yet nobody went to jail for it. Nothing was Investigated.

"Today's verdict is leaving me and many Americans in despair. I was raised to have a heart, work hard, and follow the rules. It physically hurts to see what is going on with the criminality, sexual perversions, and double standards in the US and around the World. Would it be too much to ask for you give us a win? It doesn't have to be a rook or a queen...a pawn or two will do.   We are so greatful for your strength and courage. I pray every day for your safety and success in making America great again. Godspeed.  A law-abiding American   "
"If this worthless Congress doesn’t pass #KatesLaw now, there is no hope for this nation."
"Surely as *then* Director of the FBI he would have known it was **President elect** Trump and not **Candidate** Trump's transition team who wanted communications established right? Wouldnt he have been in the know about this? If so, then why would he have knowingly hyped todays fake news with some gay ass tweet? Isnt his choices that he knew and still felt the need to throw fuel on the fake news fire today or he was completely incompetent as the FBI director(like we already know) and didnt know? Does that about sum it up? Am i missing something?  This is all assuming his tweet was in regards to the fake news in which im sure it was. Right?  Maybe im looking to far into it, i dont know anymore. I do know that he is a weasel though"
Fuck liberals  Fuck illegals  Fuck /u/spez  MAGA!
Wake The Masses! We need Massive Red Pilling!
"GEOTUS has shown us one thing, and that is for sure. The U.S.  major media is so completely biased towards the left that no one in their right mind could dispute that they are literally(and I mean this in a literal sense), so against conservative values and thoughts that they are willing to propagate anything that they can to make their views look normal and as being the majority. It is a sad day when even though we all know what is right and what is wrong, we, or they, have to second guess ourselves ( which I don’t do, but many sheep must). How much evidence must be accumulated to destroy the guilty (Clinton, Colmey, Obama, Lynch, Steinle shooter)? This entire thing begins to become a charade. What will happen if the puppet masters win? How long will the good old USA last if this becomes the norm in politics and media? Will we become a nation like Sweden or a nation like Poland? What is the end game?"
Never cared for crooks
I don't know why but I've started to notice a lot more crazier and crazier ideas for trying to impeach Trump.
"Earlier this year liberals were crying that Trump removed some tweets and that it was a crime to do so, yet they now call for the anti-muslim video to come down? Wouldn't the destruction of public record also be a crime if a company does it?"
..and I've got the fucking problem???
"The republicans got what they deserved yesterday, this is what happens when you do not work with the president. "
"Anyone have an update on these? With all we've learned today and the fact that the OIG has an 11 month ongoing investigation that is happening, could it truly be? Michael Horowitz is the current IG and could have been replaced at the beginning of Trump's term, if Trump chose to replace him. Why didn't he? Anyone know anything about Horowitz? Maybe we've missed it all along and he's the one Draining the Swamp. "
"It's funny how he is brought out right at the point where Trump talks about Moore, right when Swamp Turtle says ""Alabama will decide"" just like it was planned.  Weird. "
This is what our president is fighting...  http://www.citizenreviewonline.org/2010/Jun/communism.html
"I'm writing a letter, an actual typed up, sent-by-USPS letter, to every Republican in the house and senate demanding they put an end to this sanctuary city fucking horseshit.  No more fucking chain migration, no more people of ZERO FUCKING VALUE being used to build a sectarian democrat voting bloc (while legal aliens get fucked because they have the audacity to follow the laws).  No more sanctuary to law breakers.  No more free fucking passes.  I'm officially involved in politics now...I'll be donating my time and money and effort to fighting this fucking garbage.    This was a giant fuck up from those cunts in San Fransisco - the subhuman defense lawyer, the assholes on the jury, the social justice shitstains and the reconquistidors who want to re-absorb California into Mexico.  Fuck all of them.  This is our country and we are going to fucking take it back.    Who the fuck is with me?"
This is amazing.
"With the new report about the inauguration text messages, I am thinking that he lied about that and that is why he is being charged.  It would make sense.  Why the hell would the investigation give a shit about a transitional government meeting?  A plan to make good on pre-arranged deals with foreign governments is kind of a no no."

Maybe its better to let the rot continue being exposed for a while but soon the president should publicly fire each top fbi offical naming the reasons for each one as the largest internal conspiracy to coverup crimes in the history of the FBI.  He should name the specifcs for each person and their links to hillary and comey and others and include the fraudulent dossier improperly usedto unconstitutionally  to appoint a special prosecutor whose ties to comey he should also name before firing HIM.  he should publicly say he will ensure the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute this huge unprecedented criminal conspiracy within the FBI and if the Department of Justice is incapable of doing so he will fire them as well and bring in appointees outside of washington DC as emergency appointments given the apparent grave and unprecedented political conspiracy within the FBI and Department of Justice  He should also pardon any one indicated so far by those people with the simple message that the origination of the indictment and charges were clearly wrong and if a separate investigation later conducted properly finds those individuals guilty he will not stand in the way of proper justice.  He should do it all live in a press conference. 
They'll even act indignant about it and play the victim.
"It's always funny how facebook liberals are sharing NowTHIS videos of the democrat senators who SWORE the market would tank under trump's presidency, as if now they know what they are talking about. These people have always been wrong, and there's no indication they will ever be right.  Furthermore I have people who literally were at the bottom of the class in high school attempting to tell me to believe their sources of buzzfeed and elizabeth warren... These people should feel lucky they can vote. I wish there was a minimum requirement of understanding cause/effect relationships, or at the very least not living off of benefits to vote.   It's the same reason politicians always vote for a pay raise; the democrats will always be successful in gaining votes from the welfare voters because they promise to expand welfare. If you aren't contributing you SHOULDN'T get a say."
"Peter Strzok,FBI investigator  Conflict much?    ""Peter Strzok, as deputy head of counterintelligence at the FBI, was a key player in the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server to do government work as secretary of state, as well as the probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. During the Clinton investigation, Strzok was involved in a romantic relationship with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The extramarital affair was problematic, these people said, but of greater concern among senior law enforcement officials were text messages the two exchanged during the Clinton investigation and campaign season, in which they expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton.""  http://archive.is/ESCra"

"The Donald is full of political refugees. How did we come to this green and yuge land we love? I'll tell you the story.   Those were dark times, very dark. It was 2015 and we had strayed far from Gods light. We were adrift on an angry sea of globalist cucks hidden below us, costumed in the guise of opposed political forces. We couldn't see it then because we were to far from the light but it wasn't an opposition of forces that was bucking our sinking vessel, but rather a single monster with two heads. On one side of the ship we saw a head of a donkey, spewing fire and on the other the head of an elephant spitting cold water. We couldn't see that there was only one beast, a single monster, whose tentacles had slipped into all of our wallets and purses suckling endlessly on our labors as it kept us in fear of our beloved boat  sinking.   Above us the sky was no comfort. The sun was blotted out by and endless swirling hurricane of fake news. It was loud, inescapable, and whenever we saw a slither of blue, a hint of truth to get our true bearing in the storm it seemed some malicious force we only ever saw in the smallest way would reach out a dark hand to spread the fake news cloud like burning ash to blot out hope.  This horror went on for years and even the most patriotic of us eventually began to fall into despair that we were going to be lost here forever. When almost all hope was gone one day in 2015 we spotted something off the starboard bow, a light in the distance. We were far away but it looked like a break in the clouds, a golden staircase shining through all the raging fake news and settling on solid ground. It was so far away.  A few of us saw it. It rekindled our patriotic fire and we immediately began preparation for bringing the ship about. As the light reached us we realized so many of our countrymen had gone blind in the storm. In horror we witnessed our friends leaping enthusiastically off the ship onto a communist barge that had anchored next to us port side. It was barely above water and sinking under its own stupidity already. It's ancient captain spoke of free shit and social justice a sirens song for the weak minded. Those poor bastards threw everything they had into that barge, unaware of the poor and damning rigging underneath. We had no choice but to abandon some of them, they were just to far gone. As they reached the barge they turned into creatures in their own right. Their hair became shades of blue, and pink, and red and they yelled their captains name and cursed us. They became twisted mindless creatures as the churning waters touched them, and they cursed their parents and cheered as bulls lay with their women. All we could do was mourn quietly as we threw out lifelines and turned the ship twords that new, bright golden light.  That's when we could finally see him. The Golden Man. Some on the boat called him an illusion and cried out in horror. Even those of us who understood that this was something new, something different from the creatures above and below, had to be cautious. Then we heard it. Above the roaring fake news, above the free shit, free shit, chants of the lost children, above the cries of horror from the lost on the boat, we heard it, and we knew our course. Faintly and with a New York accent we heard it, and in some of us the fire of patriotism ignited again.  ""make america great again...""   It was so far away but I knew, and I could start to see that others did too, we had to get there. But as we edged closer to the light, we realized that the monsters were not just above and below. At some point they had come aboard and started to masquerade as one of us. We had no idea how far we were from shore, no idea what the monsters around us would do, but we also had no idea that we had allies hidden by the storm either.  Someone among us fashioned a makeshift wheel and rudder, and we saw it and knew that it was good and we called it The_Donald.  From there we changed course to the Golden Man's direction desperate to reach solid earth and that golden staircase, and come what may we knew we had a country to save.  ~ And it happened just like that. Sure, the fight isn't over, and I obviously didn't include the New Testament of Kek, but this is why we are MAGA. We threw off the UniParty monster a year ago. For me it was during the tournament of trials when RNC swamp monsters disenfranchised their people to slide their King Rat in. Others have their own tales. This is why we are not Republicans, or Democrats: we are MAGA."

So a person I know was just fired from Bank of America for what I believe to be an unfair reason. This person would see news headlines on the internet and knew he couldn't look into or research them at work so he would copy and paste links into his work email and send them to his private email to look into later. So he never sent them to anyone else but himself. Now some of these articles were about topics such as pizzagate and Hillary Clinton so he was fired for having offensive emails. He was never given any warnings to stop he was just fired after working there for over 3 years. Now this seems like some kind of Witch Hunt to me especially since he didn't send them to anyone but himself and because he was not given any warning. What do you guys think? Was this fair? Is there anything that this person should do?

"These simple steps can be done to fix most problems:  - Repeal the 1965 immigration act. It gave priority to and opened the floodgates to let 3rd worlders flood the US. Prior to the 1965 immigration act, 90% of immigration came from Europe  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  - Pass the RAISE act, but add further restrictions such as:     - No welfare to any immigrant who enters ever. At the very least make it 10 years without being able to get welfare. This will cut off many free loading parasites      - No immigration from 3rd world countries. The US already has more than enough poverty and we don't need to import more.    - Make sure the potential immigrant candidate knows to speak English fluently.   - Make a law that requires it so that any immigrant who applies and gets accepted into the US can't have duel-citizenship. Having someone with duel citizenship is a potential loyalty issue and liability. How would we know they actually want to help the US and not undermine it?    - Make sure the immigrant candidates would actually support themselves. If the US is to keep the gates open, at least make sure those who are let in will be a net positive, not a negative who lowers wages.   - Limit the amount of immigrants allowed to enter by 90%. Period. If possible every single non-American would want to enter the US. Would be best to limit immigration and make it so only the creme-de-la enter.   - No Chain migration. Period. This is a big problem and is being abused heavily. Make it so that everyone has to go through the same rigorous screening.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  - Cut welfare. Too many people would rather parasite off welfare than work. Because lets face it, why work for minimum wage, when for a similar amount you can sit at home without doing anything, sleep till 12pm, and then buy yourself a nice tasty lobster or steak dinner, all paid for by US tax payers.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -  Trump did this already completed tax reforms, so one part is done  ~~Tax reforms. Cut taxes for middle class and poor class heavily. Like Bannon said, increase taxes for the richest of the rich to offset the lowered taxes for middle and poor class. Also close all loop holes.~~   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  - Remove all 40 million illegal aliens by any means necessary. This is a big one.   - This is 1/4 of the total population of Mexico living in the US, and more people here illegally than even live in Canada (Canada has about 38 million people)   - removing illegal aliens would drastically raise wages for US citizens and workers.     - Adding a huge penalty like Life in prision for anyone who hires illegal aliens would be victory for US workers.  - Add a huge penalty for anyone who helps illegal aliens. They are abetting criminals, just like the one who murdered Kate. life in prison would make them think twice about putting Illegal aliens above US citizens   - Deporting these illegal aliens parasites would also save the US about $140 billion yearly as illegal aliens are known to parasite off tax payer funded services like the ER.   - Give ICE more freedom in going after illegal aliens. Also equip them with weapons as we already had cases of illegal aliens murdering not only US citizens but also cops.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  - Start enforcing the McCarthy Anti-Communist acts.    - The US currently has a huge problem with commies infiltrating universities and many other positions (ie Berkeley mayor who is part of antifa terrorist group). Commie infilitration has been warned before by defector Yuri. Also McCarthy had discovered many commies himself, imagine how much worse it is now    - Mark the far left terrorist group antifa as terrorists and prosecute all of their members to the highest degree possible. There's no other way to stop these traitors.    - Also go after BLM/LaRaza and other far left radical groups. Prosecute and punish them for their crimes and riots.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Start enforcing the Sherman Anti-Trust act against Google and other monopolies like Facebook/Twitter.   Google is already powerful enought to be censoring [Poland since it's government made a video exposing the muslim rapefugee invasion](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/12/06/poland-government-migrant-youtube-jail/). For a monopoly to have more power than a country is too much.  Google must be broken up and regulated. No exeception. At the very least the same ruling used to stop the ATT/BEll monopoly from censoring ""wrong thought"" has to be forced onto google/facebook/twitter. Otherwise we'll be living in actual 1984 controlled by corporations pushing a marxist agenda."

The days of working in a factory and being able to live the American dream are over.  Lack of necessary skills has lead to structural unemployment for American workers.  The disadvantage of the free market is that these corporations will look for the highest skilled employee for the lowest wage which is why you see these engineer's from Asia who were learning computer programming since the 6th grade and went to college practically free.  Simply driving out immigrants would actually hurt the economy because   we don't have enough US workers with the necessary skills to match to these jobs nowadays.  Colleges are like half foreign exchange students now.  The government should be helping our kids go to school to get these skills necessary to compete in the 21st century.  But our whole fucking system revolves around profit and the only true discriminant is money.  We should reform elementary education and provide a path to free college for American citizens and make foreign exchange students pay the costs.  The real enemy is the corporations and for-profit institutions making you pay a shitload for school then giving you a shitty salary once you get out because we are competing on a labor market with no national constraints.

"When President Trump first came on, yeah, I always liked the guy, but thought it would be short lived.  Then he made the comment, that he'd give Christians a voice.  I started listening.  He kept winning, as the man always does.  I was hooked.  I think that was early in his campaign, so I guess I have been on for a while.  I don't want any props, I'm just saying this amazing President of ours, continues to impress me.  What he did this week, I don't get misty in my eyes often, but when he declared Jerusalem capital of Israel, I literally couldn't contain myself.  After years and years of being attacked, as we still are, Christians and Jews, but someone who fights for us in President Trump, this is amazing to me.

"“Congressman Johnson” (OH) “I sent this to Johnson 12/7/17”  “I am writing in regards to your president Whip-Up Trump who has openly incited violence in Israel. I don’t know if I agree or disagree with claiming Jerusalem as the capital of Israel but with that stupid move he gave up any chance of a peace agreement over there. His announcement has caused half of the world to condemn his move and yet I have heard nothing from all you congressman. Do you just not give a dam? Party cannot be that important that you value it more than starting a war over there, not to mention endangering all of our diplomats overseas. Where in the he#l are all your democratic values if you even have any.  Your party and Whip-up are supporting a pedophile for the Senate and your president Wimp-up supported the white supremacists even after they killed a woman in North Carolina.  He has also gone out of his way to provoke a war in North Korea which everyone has said is a stupid idea because so many innocent people would be killed.   On top of all that he is an admitted sexual abuser in his own words on the Hollywood tape that was released during the campaign. This is the most disgusting low life individual to ever set in the White House which should be the Red House after all the bloodshed in Israel.  Just when will you people do the right thing and remove this demigod and dictator from office? I guess maybe after he signs your tax cut bill giving money to the rich at the expense of healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security for the people who you are supposed to represent.

"My dad taught me to tell the truth. Not only is it right, but whether or not you have done right, lying takes you down a dark path. Fake News loves to lie. Lies sell pages, clicks, and shares. And those get them money. What do we call a professional liar? Used to be a Defense Attorney. I guess now we'll add media faces - I hate to participate in their fiction and call them journalists.  Fake News stories often evolve. The ACA will save money and you can keep your doctor. Until rates rise 25% a year for a few years and doctor's offices close for lack of ability to pay a third clerk for ACA paper pushing.  Illegal immigrants are only dangerous when we marginalize them and keep them out. But don't look at the number of Americans killed by illegals claiming six imaginary dependents on their tax returns filed under a stolen SSN. We had over one hundred SSNs belonging to Americans born over 106 years ago run through E-Verify to begin employment. God bless and good health, right?  The President is a racist sexist Hitler who defeated our anointed token woman with his woman-led campaign, appointed a qualified and diverse cabinet, and followed through on President Bush and Obama's campaign promise to Israel.  Wikileaks sent DJT's people information on H campaign leaks 2 weeks before they were made publicly available. 3 sources confirmed it! But all 3 were wrong. Some guy emailed it to them after Wikileaks' latest went viral. No retraction though...

Their response was ""so what"", and despite impeachment for lying he was able to avoid any other punishment or ramifications. Democrats and Hollywood just got worse from then on. Almost openly degenerate.     Then comes the God Emperor Trump (aka The President), they saw him destroy the Republican field and saw that internal polls were showing Trump inching on Clinton and likely winning.     THEY GOT DESPERATE    They couldn't help it. They were already pandering to women and fears of racism. They attacked Trump on the GOPe released Billy Bush tape. They ran with it. They lined up a fake lawsuit with anonymous accusers. They mislead past girlfriends of Trump in interviews (that they themselves would denounce and defend The Big D) And it still didn't work. This became their habit and pattern.    Then Roy Moore happened. It was another GOPe and Liberal establishment half baked alliance. McConnell didn't want Roy Moore, and the democrats lined up fake accusers (all debunked and tied to either past court cases where Moore ruled against them or they are politically active for Moore opponents). And its not working.    But what happened? Sexual allegations now haunt the liberal establishment, for all their finger pointing the real serial sexual abusers have been the democrats, because 20 some odd years ago they said character does not matter."

And I god-damn-guarantee you these retarded ass leftists left incriminating communications on their .gov emails.    Get the emails, establish sedition/conspiracy charges against these fools, and give us a Saudi style purge of all leftists and RINOS from our government.  ***** Alternatively, and I fully support this, hear the ""accusers"" out.  Of course, the federal government would be obligated to monitor all of their communications, in order to intercept death threats delivered by ""overzealous supporters of the President.""    These are valuable witnesses, after all, and a temporary intrusion of the government into their lives to ensure their safety should be a comfort, not a hindrance.  Also, just to prove that they're telling the truth, and that Trump is a lying SOB, I think they should take a polygraph, accompanied by a blood test.  You know. To show how truthful they are.  You know. Just to confirm, 100% beyond shadow of a doubt that they're not lying.  *** Thoughts?"
"It seems like this is the left right now. In an exorcism the demon screams and fights while holy water touches them or when the priest is praying on them. The left is screaming and fighting while Trump removes the evil that's filled this country for so long.   If you're not religious, then it's like taking drugs away from a junky in an intervention. They don't want change, they want to be carried across the finish line and are fighting tooth and nail to keep the gravy train.   Winning tastes sweet. "

I want to know why the left thinks they have a legitimate argument that this is a bad plan and will only benefit the rich. It's the same old argument they use EVERY SINGLE TIME a republican talks taxes. I just don't believe them. I personally put my information into that tax calculator website and it said I'd be saving between 3000 and 4500 on my taxes. I'm middle class at earning right above 100k with heavy student loan debt. Everyone else I asked to try it even had some kind of reduction in their tax burden.

And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.   And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;   And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

"I was trying to think up a good analogy to explain net neutrality repeal and why it's a good thing in a way anyone can understand. Imagine instead of internet providers we have printing presses that make books and magazines ect. Separate companies make money by publishing a magazine and bring it to the printing press company to get their books made and distributed.   Well the trouble starts when the printing press companies start buying and partnering with magazines and newspapers. They print and distribute their own magazine that they own. Well eventually they get backlogged and decide that their own magazine is more important than that of a 3rd party they are in competition with so they delay (throttle) the printing of the competitors magazine and that results in a shortage on release day. Word gets out that this happened and there is an uproar among publishers. A group of publishers say thats not fair and bring a lawsuit against the printing press. The judge in the case rules that unless the printing press is controlled by the state as a mail courier and books/magazines are classified as letters - the government has no say on regulation of how printing presses prioritize or distribute their materials. (That's actually a case that happened outside the analogy vs Verizon). So the government decides to change printing presses to be considered mail couriers and subject to federal regulation and control. In order to print books and magazines and deliver them - you now have to have a postal couriers license.   The government promises everyone that by taking control of printing presses - they will make sure everyone's books get made with equal priority by law. People actually begin to protest this government seize of power at this point - questions are asked like ""Hey why didn't the printing presses just make more printers to be capable of producing larger amounts of material? Why are we handing over control of the free market? Why do you need a license now to publish books?"" You see - in this analogy - the printing presses have been very lazy with innovating because they haven't had much competition really in over 30 years. The government originally gave them a ton of money when printing presses were first invented to build more presses  - but they instead pocketed the money and used it to keep their prices artificially low - a factor which made it very hard to enter the printing press business.   Eventually the liberal president is replaced by a conservative one who asks the chairman of the Federal Mail Couriers regulatory body and they repeal the courier classification and license requirement to return things to the free market. The owning companies of the most popular magazines - like the Netflix magazine which takes up about 40% of every printing presses productive capacity- become upset with the notion of having to pay more to reserve such a large portion of the printing presses capacity. Similar companies begin lobbying together to convince the public that if this repeal goes through - Netflix magazine might have to raise it's prices or the printing press might tack on an extra $4.99 per copy to get it on time. People when they hear their favorite magazines might go up in price start getting really upset (despite that not having been the case before the rule came into play because economics). These companies even begin spreading the rumor that because of competitive rivalry between printing presses - there might only be regional availability of certain magazines. People might not be able to get Netflix magazine in certain areas because it's not part of their local printing presses distribution network. Critics quickly point out that's complete bullshit because in a free market - that would just open a new opportunity for a new company to print those magazines and ship them to the areas where they are in demand - and make the missed money their stupid competitor missed out on.   Anyway - long analogy - but I think that's an easier way to look at it philosophically. Giving government control of printing presses (and control over free speech) by being able to deny licenses to parties spreading ideas and messages they don't like is way more dangerous than the risk of paying $4.99 extra for a magazine. People are especially ignorant if that's the sole reason they are willing to hand over control of the publication of free information. Especially when the real problem is not enough printing machines - the government is what bungled this whole thing in the first place by intervening!  SPEZ: Formatting and a word here or there. "

"1. Trumps economy proves he knows what he’s doing on that front.   2. The gulf wants a modern economy. Trump can deliver that.   3. That would turn the gulf into a trading partner for Israel, strengthening shared strategic interest.   4. Everyone would prefer if Palestinian territory was safe and economically booming, as they could be a business conduit between Israel and the rest of the region.   5. Trump let Mattis loose. He knows Iran is a threat. He’s helping the Saudis push back Iran.   6. The Saudis seemed like the were stalling in Yemen only because they focused on the Levant first (much like we once did with Germany). Now Yemen is almost won.   7. A weak and isolated Iran means a weak and isolated Hezbollah, even before you consider that Obama leaving office meant they will lose most of their revenue from the Americas.   8. A toothless Hezbollah frees Israel to focus on Hamas and Fatah.   9. Hamas and Fatah also loose most if not all support they may have had from a now weakened Iran.   10. Response to Trumps embassy move tells Palestinians the world wants to help, but not enough to actually do anything that hurts us or Israel.    11. With Iran pushed back, GCC anti terror efforts could be focused on Palestine.   12. Hamas and Fatah loose any and all hope of military support, be it direct or indirect. Gulf countries are getting serious about fighting their terrorist activities. The Israelis have more energy to focus on them than ever before, especially considering the strength of her alliances.   13. Help is coming to Hamas and Fatah only in the form of impotent virtue signals. They have no strategic options. If Hamas and Fatah don’t make a deal, they won’t be able to do anything.   14. Looking forward to a Trump inspired economic boom, and with the help trillions of dollars confiscated by the Saudis in corruption stings, a deal is offered that makes Palestine, and its leaders, very rich in exchange for peace on what are effectively Israel’s terms.

(explanation: the reddit upvote tokens on othe rwebpages all libk right back to the reddit webserver. The reddit wdb server laods everytime you view a webpage contaiing ing a redddit upvote icon. The reddit webserver looks on your computer for your reddit cookie which is an id nunber it identifies you with. So everytime you visit any other page with a reddit icon reddit knows you went to those pages.  This happens EVEN IF YOU DONT CLICK THE ICON.  Thats what all those little icons all over the internet are for. They track you across all webpages notifying the icon webserver where you are.  The pictures may be small but each one opens the full websorver page of the associated social media site like facebook, twitter ,reddit etc. In your browser in the background (thats one reason webapges take so damn long to load now . You are really opening about 20 webservers on every pageinckuding advertisers webservers and heaps of javascript that can tell who you are and where you are.)  Oh and by the way the webpage doesnt even have to actually display a reddit or facebook little picture icon. It can just displsy a clear photo overlay or a single transparent pixel that you dont see and it will still load all the reddit or fscebook tracking code."

"Its that time of year again, where family members come together to share their opinions over holiday feasts. I had an interesting one last night with a family member and we were discussing the recent sexual harassment allegations. For reference, I am a man arguing with a much older man;  FM:""These harassment claims are horrible! These men are using their positions of power to sexually assault these women just looking to earn a living wage!""  Me:""But Ive been sexually harassed by a women in my life time too. Does that mean they are in a 'position of power'?""   FM:""Thats different.""  me:""Why?""  FM:""Because in all these public accusations, the men were the women's superiors and using that position to influence the women.""  Me:""Ive been sexually harassed by a women who was a superior over me in the workplace. Does that mean she is doing it from a ""position of power'?""   FM:""No. Because she more than likely had a male supervisor.""  Me:""Oooooook... What about a stripper? Isnt she in a position of power? I mean, she is literally controlling the men around her by using her body and other skills to illicit money from them. She even has bouncers enforcing the hierarchy at the establishment.""  FM:""No, because the men have money which is the literal representation of power. Them having the money puts them in the position of power.""  Me:""Ok, but what if there are women in the crowd giving money to the stripper? Arent they then in a 'position of power'?""  FM:""No.""  Me:""LOL""     Then before we could continue this train of thought we were interrupted and and never got a conclusion. Oh well, maybe next year. "

"Strzok writes ""I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office that there’s no way he gets elected – but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”  The above memo is the insurance policy - that Strzok thought would never see the light of day and would protect him from be prosecuted or thrown under the bus by the other corrupt FBI agents like McCabe.  He didn't have to use ""Andy's office"".   The woman was there she knew where the conversation took place.   It  is a violation of federal laws (start with Hatch act).  Note this was written right around the time the FISA warrants started.  Strzok knew he was breaking the law, new about Fusion, knew he covered up for Hillary.  So he writes this email to ensure he will never be prosecuted unless Andy is willing to go down with the ship too.   So far it worked he has kept his job in the FBI.    Again expecting that Hillary would win, it is these emails that Strzok thought would be his insurance policy to protect himself."

"How far back does this go? How deep? If the heads and deputy heads of these agencies are so extremely bold, it must run deeper. Almost inspiring lower level agents/attorneys with similar views to abuse their position and power for political purposes.  Every federal arrest, any investigation or arrest made by the FBI, literally all of it needs to be reviewed.  This is absolute insanity, and Barack Hussein Obama is going to have A LOT to answer for when this is all said and done.  Investigate all of it. Don't care how much it costs, this is the sanctity of our rule of law we're talking about. This is one of the cornerstones of our nation. The bedrock.  The public trust is giving way, if it hasn't gone completely already.  INVESTIGATE THE WHOLE FUCKIN THING!  "

The party is full of those who've bought into the cultural Marxist agenda and might as well be Labor (our Democrats). - one seat is up for re-election on Saturday (Bennelong) - if the incumbent RINO wins, we're stuck with a RINO government - if the Australian Conservatives candidate Joram Richa wins, the RINOs will need to court him to hold a majority. We will have them by the balls. - Joram is young, solid, and values family, freedom of expression, free enterprise, and small government. He's the guy T_D would back.

"He phrases it like tax cuts for the rich come out of the pockets of other Americans, rather than the truth that the government just won’t collect as much.

Was 401k contribution limited or effected somehow?    If you have any further advice please feel to drop a comment as well, thank you. "
"Here's a little thought exercise to put things in perspective as you follow the news...  Imagine you're Donald Trump in January 2017.  You're a new president, and you want to drain the swamp - but you have a few issues.  The first would be that the swampy institutions are deep and extensive.  The second is that a good portion of the American people (including many Republicans) want to believe that their government is basically good.  The third is that there's a lot of America (again including many Republicans) who are still skeptical about you and your intentions.  If you wanted to be successful, you would have to play the long game.  Because if you put Hillary in jail right away, everyone would freak out.  If you started telling people how truly corrupt the institutions are, they would think you were crazy.  And all along, the swampy deep state would be doing everything they could to undermine and discredit you.  So you play the long game:  You allow a special counsel to be appointed that is filled with people who are clearly not loyal to you.  You know there is no evidence of collusion, because it never happened.  So you walk carefully, but you let them investigate all they want.  They longer they go without finding anything, the more people believe that you're innocent.  And when it comes out how truly corrupt they are, and everyone is calling for you to fire them - you just leave them alone.  More people start to believe that you are in fact innocent.  Meanwhile, you focus on keeping your promises.  Work with congress on big issues and try to push forward your agenda.  Pick fights with the NFL.  Just keep the media attention on you so that no one pays attention to Rex Tillerson cleaning house at the State Dept, or Betsy DeVoss cleaning house a the Education Dept, or the Sleepy Doc cleaning house at HUD.    Also, in the background you have Sessions putting together evidence against all the crooks.  Sure, he recused himself from the investigation into your involvement with Russia - but that's going no where anyways.  He didn't recuse himself from gathering evidence of all of the corruption by Hillary and Obama and their crew.  Have him stock pile all of it so that once the time is right you can do what's needed.   Take your time though - it has to be done right because you only get one shot.  Also pretend to be really mad about him recusing himself.  That will distract the press for at least a few weeks.  Oh yeah - surround yourself with military brass.  They are one of the last patriotic and honest institutions in America and they will have your back.  Especially if you have Saint Mattis on your side and show them your loyalty to them by making him your SecDef.  'Pedes - if you think about this in the big picture, it all makes sense.  Mueller isn't our guy, but he's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing.  Sessions is definitely our guy, and he's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing.  I suspect that Flynn is also doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing.  We're getting closer.   Normies are starting to realize that the whole Muh Russia thing is fake.  They are starting to see how corrupt the FBI is.  They are seeing Trump keep his promises and seeing the economy boom.   It may happen by Christmas, or it may not, but it is happening.  All the evidence points that way."
"AL is still a deep red state.  What you witnessed was the democrats and their paid for media going all out to keep Trump from getting an easy senate majority.  They even sacrificed Franken for it.  All of that for a senator that will be around 2 years.  Trump tried to avoid this mess by pushing for Strange, someone he knows wouldn't back him 100%, but Moore had too much support then.  Dems get a win, but we still have a president that's winning every day.  Now, if only we could get voter ID and paper ballots everywhere."
"Democrats are attacking Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s credibility after the Department of Justice released text messages showing a top FBI agent on both the Clinton email investigation and the Russia probe rooting for Clinton while he was investigating her and discussing an unknown “insurance policy” against Trump in case he won the election.  The pro-Clinton, anti-Trump messages were, ironically, discovered as part of an investigation into the DOJ and FBI launched by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General (IG) in response to Democratic politicians demanding a probe into possible anti-Clinton bias at the FBI.  Democratic politicians and left-wing media have attacked Rosenstein’s credibility in response, claiming he should have blocked the messages’ release.

"For those out of the loop: In Wisconsin, A legal witch-hunt was mounted against Scott Walker and the Republican party over an alleged ""campaigning on public time"" charge. This investigation cost millions and was led by democrats, resulting in private email seizure, voice recordings, and slanderous leaks against Republican legislators including emails of a current Senate candidate and her daughter.  (Archive.is failed me: https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/12/06/investigation-into-john-doe-leak-complete-could-made-public-wednesday/927991001/)  This probe has long been sealed and finished, resulting in no charges against anyone, and millions of dollars wasted. Attorney General Brad Schimel has recommended contempt charges against those overseeing the John Doe witch hunt for leaking private emails and documents to The Guardian after the investigation was ordered to be shut down by a judge.  Let me state that again. The Democrats had NOTHING on Wisconsin Republicans, could not file charges, and instead LEAKED documents to the press to try Conservatives in the media instead of in the courtroom.

"Donald Trump was a movement. It was a big FUCK YOU to the establishment. We all did our part and defeated a rigged system to get this man into office and we should be proud of ourselves for that. But now things get tough. November 8th wasn't the final victory - it was the start of a new hope that we had for our country and a shout out to all the corrupt politicians and crooks in charge that we won't take their shit anymore. But we've gotten soft, and we let the crooks start winning again.  &amp;nbsp;  That feeling you felt when Roy Moore lost is a lesser version of the feeling the liberals felt on November 8th. You feel anger, frustration, and vulnerability, and most importantly you are MAD. But you won't stoop to their level because we are better than that. We won't run into the streets with pitchforks calling Doug Jones a fake senator (even if there's a chance he is). But we have to do something. They will lie, cheat, and steal their way to the top because that's what political Democrats do, and they will feel no remorse. To them it's well deserved payback. The worst part is - They WILL win unless we do something to fight back.   &amp;nbsp;  Our voices are silenced by the media, so it's up to us to find other ventures where we can be heard. The_Donald is our headquarters but the action takes place on the streets. Did Roy Moore really do the things they accused him of? Doesn't matter, because it worked. Innocent until proven guilty is for the courtroom - in a political race all that matters is public opinion. And the public opinion was swayed just enough to allow a Democrat to take Alabama. This wouldn't have been possible without the smear campaign and they KNOW it. And they won't stop either. They are only beginning to taste the joys of winning, and we are forced to deal with it in our own confines of the internet. Face it - we weren't heard this election, yet we could have been. As a group we have to find a way to fight back. At this rate 2020 is not a lock. Instead it is a BIG ""?"". If we lose that one you can bet we'll never win again. Are you okay with that?"
"And yet, they do nothing to help the people of Iran escape their religious prison!

Over the past days. I️ have seen so many red pills being swallowed on Twitter...   The tax cuts are just the first part...  Now that Jeff Sessions is starting to make some noise about Uranium One.  I️ think that will open the flood gates of truth for a lot of reasonable Americans..      Not only that.  If we can take a second to think. Now that we got the taxes taken care of.   Trump in theory will have a lot more spending money with all the extra revenue created..   We will most likely see a ton of winning with the wall and infrastructure in 2018...   you can be sure of that...   Also a little note. The regressives on the left have most of their weapons of the culture war taken from them. With GEOTUS throwing red pills candies on Twitter..  That means we have to work harder this upcoming year.  An animal is always most dangerous when backed into a corner. That means they will stop at nothing to try to disrupt the MAGA train.    Be vigilant of false flags. And fake news   Merry Christmas to all 
"Perhaps I am the last to realize this, but it seems that many of use know that democrats are simply using minorities and foreigners but I had never stopped to fully examine the relationship. From what I have deduced, most of the groups democrats import and rely on for votes (Hispanic, African, Muslim) are actually quite traditional and conservative in their own way. Hispanics are overwhelmingly devout Catholics, Africans+Muslims believe in what the left would call 'gender roles' etc. It seems that these groups are simply so desperate so to speak to enter this country that they have a sort of unholy alliance with the left. You let us &amp; our families in, we vote for you regardless of your policies as long as more people like me (the diversity) get to come here."

In order to make things fair across the board the Colleges should be grade sharing, the grades could be averaged across the class, the highest grade earners would be helping bring the lowest grade earners grades up, resulting in more students graduating college which means higher paying jobs.

"So in the comics and TV show Arrow or Smallville, Oliver Queen aka the Green Arrow is a costumed vigilante who fights bad guys to keep things simple. Plus a quick explanation for those who have no clue who I'm talking about.   Years ago in the 1970's Denis O Neil and Neal Adams redid the Green Arrow chracter with turning him into a loud mouth liberal and that has unfortunately stuck with him ever since at times.  To where some fans will heatedly defend GA being a liberal and say he needs to be a liberal to make the chracter work.   Of course their whole argument is simply boiled down to this ""Green Arrow is based off of Robin Hood and the fighting for the little guy can only be done if your a liberal.""   The founding fathers of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Sam and John Adams, John Hancock and everybody else when they decided to break away from Great Britain becoming criminals in the eyes of the England, as basically the little guy.   Why is this important? Because the founding fathers were very far from being liberals and pretty much proves that the whole ""Oh GA is a liberal since only liberals can defend the little guy"" is total bullcrap.   Also the liberal for the little guy doesn't even make any since the liberals are supporters of big government, no freewill or rights for the common man unless they want them, support proven criminals who have money, power, influence etc.   So really a true Green Arrow belief of fighting for the little guy wouldn't be a liberal, it would be on the other side of the fence.   In the recent GA comics it's SJW to the max, made Trump a villain, feminism cranked up regarding some of the female characters and conservatives are always evil. Of course the comics are getting praised by people who really don't understand what's truly going on.  Frankly Green Arrow should be heading towards some people we all know who are guilty, not going after President Trump.   The Arrow TV show well it was fairly liberal free for awhile outside of a few bits here and there and while never got as bad as Supergirl, it did crank it up in season 5 with a pro on gun control episode, contrary to the show writers comments otherwise.  Then season 6 had a Nazi special crossover with shots towards the American people by comparing us to Nazis by using the MAGA similar to a Nazi slogan. And has a black lives matter episode coming up in the back half of the season unless something has changed and I doubt it.   Needless to say all that convinced me to drop the show in addition to the show's quality went down the drain in more ways then describe for this anyway and this already far to long.   Anyhow this just be ranting pretty much and wanted to upload this here well because I knew you guys would understand even if you have no real clue what on earth I'm actually taking about for the chracter and such.   Really would be nice if one day somebody came in and fixed this chracter to actually remove him from the liberal mess he's in and make Green Arrow a true fighter for the little guy.   Merry Christmas to all of you out there. "

"Had a chat with a few relatives before they went home about 30 mins ago. We were talking about government and I was expressing why I like small government. Talking about the roads and infrastructure in my own country how it is fucked and government has fucked it as well as business. Together they fucked us over dont get me wrong  They brought up voting rights in Croatia how everything goes to a referendum. My reply was ""it works because they are a homogeneous society""  And now I am a Racist.  Honestly I think it has just freed me  They so lack the ability to think outside of the bubble"

"Growing up, I spent my summers in a small town on the panhandle. I am from the northeast. I am thinking about spending my life savings to buy a big piece of land near Enid. This is where my grandparents live in retirement.  Is this a good place to raise a family? I want constitutional freedoms, land and as little interference from big government as possible. Just looking for some feedback on the way of life around here from people outside of family.   Thanks for the input and MAGA"

She has a few broken ribs, lacerated liver, and minor brain swelling. Her fiance is dead. They're lying to her about him so her blood pressure doesn't spike and mess up her liver.   Don't drink and drive pedes, it's not worth the hurt that it can cause. God bless you all and Merry Christmas.  edit: just got back from dinner, thank you so much for all the well wishes and prayers!"

"So we're all going to be saving a few thousand dollars, possibly more thanks to these cuts, what should you do with it?!  Take that extra 1.5-6% after tax income, and defer all or half of it into your 401k or your IRA.  You'll never miss the money since you haven't had it to start with, and an extra thousand dollars or 3 per year will add up real quick.  I'll do an example for you, lets say, because of the cuts, next year you're going to take home an extra 1.5k per year. If you invested that, instead of spending it, how much would you save after 10 years pedes?  24,312$....at a very modest return of 7.5%  If you have a strong stomach I'd suggest insisting on a S&amp;P 500 index fund which over an average 10 year span will yield double that interest with the caveat that occasionally the 500 index busts hard and you have to leave your money in for a few years until its back, do a little research on 2007-2017 numbers.   also the reason I say get an index fund is because of the fees associated with most mutual funds, index funds have VERY low fees and will outperform something like 90% of other managed/mutual funds, it's just that your broker won't make as much because its low fee...which is great for you.   Anyway, this isn't really investing advice, more like a suggestion...or...guidelines. Like pirate rules.  Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas!   "

"&gt;The New York Times reported in 2015 that ""shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, [former President Bill] Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock."" In total, $145 million went to the Clinton Foundation from interests linked to Uranium One, which was acquired by the Russian government nuclear agency Rosatum.

"Think of it, immediately after Flynn was charged we got this:       * 1st they released a fake Deutsche Bank story (to try and cross Trump's ""red line"" on investigating personal/family finances)     * They started releasing news of anti-Trump investigation members.     * They started releasing names of Mueller investigators that worked on past investigations, like the Hillary e-mail scandal, and began telling us how 'nefarious' their behavior was. *Strozk sent mean texts about Trump... oooooooooh, scary*      * Then we hear about the FBI ""stonewalling"" congress and talk of possible 'contempt charges'.      * Then we get constant media inquires asking Trump if he's going to fire Mueller, which he and his administration have repeated responded 'no' to.     * Then they trot out people Trump would (presumably) dislike, like Alec Baldwin and Eric Holder telling Trump he better not fire Mueller... all in some bizarre reverse psychology ploy to goad Trump into punishing them, by doing the opposite of what they 'want'.     They're doing this because:     A) So they don't have to continue the mandate of the investigation and look into Hillary's campaign...      B) So they can leave people thinking that Trump fired them because they were 'getting too close to the truth'...     C) To explain why their investigation turned up nothing... 'we were stopped from doing the full job'.     D) Maybe if they have their investigation terminated they will no longer have an IG and Congressional oversight looking into their sham investigation.     Don't buy into the liberals' ploy, make them finish out their sham investigation."

But those are first world voices. To the rest of the world, the majority of the world, America is still a beacon of hope and strength. Billions of citizens under totalitarian rule look to America as a system by which they could be free.  Yes, there are detractors. But most of them, if not all of them, are in Europe, a continent that used to run the world but has lost almost all of its global influence.

"Here is the newest claim from those assclowns. They claim that since the bill  ""benefits"" the senators interests (real estate partnerships) that they were bribed. They also claim that the senators were threatened that since they were threatened to not be funded with they didnt vote yes (they were told not to call and ask for money anymore if they didnt vote yes on the tax bill apparently) they were forced into voting for the tax bill.....I call bullshit on the first part because senators have investments outside of congress and just because its a large tax bill that benefits alot of people doesnt mean it cant benefit them. The second part, im not sure about. "

"http://i.magaimg.net/img/285w.jpg  The independent meetings which took place at the US/Arab summit told the Intel services of the major ME/Muslim countries to mount their foreign operatives in Iran TOGETHER in a fight for regime change along with Israel which we visited right after. Seems to be working. Also Quatar would be the likely source for Iranian support in an event of the start of a collapse in Iran therefor it was blockaded as an insurance policy once the STORM began. Why would 50 Muslim majority nations all CELEBRATE and DANCE at the arrival of the US unless they all knew US and Israel were going to support them in BTFOing Iran. Also we required SA to purge it's corruption as a major winning point for the US in this Operation as well. We give them Iran they give us peace in the region. This all takes time but seems to be playing out well.   The deal:  SA gets modern military and No Iran (concessions: Intel/operators, accept Israel, PURGE of Corruption)   Israel gets Jerusalem and No Iran (concessions: Intel/operators, accept US/SA arms deal)  US gets End of Terror Funding and No Iran (concessions: Arms for SA, Intel support and probably a host of other things)   All get peace  Why would the president be watching Iran so closely if this wasn't a part of a huge picture for the region AKA. THE STORM.   SPEZ: The media may not HATE Trump. He just doesn't brief them on anything like past administrations did and allow them to drive the narrative/break the story to the people, INSTEAD he shocks the world dropping the news to the people himself.

"https://www.statnews.com/2017/12/28/dr-phil-addiction/  Have to admit, I've been waiting several months for a scandal involving Dr. Phil to break. Not because I think he is a bad guy (maybe he is) but because he has spent 2017 crusading to expose the world-wide child sex-trafficking ring that many of us are already aware exists.  From March 2017: https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/25713-dr-phil-interview-exposes-global-elite-pedophiles  From August 2017: https://www.drphil.com/shows/private-planes-black-tie-parties-elite-sporting-events-the-shocking-story-of-one-womans-life-in-sex-trafficking/  Not to mention the fact that this ""scandal"" story is based on the idea that it is Dr. Phil's fault that this Todd Herzog guy-- perfect name for a cuck, btw-- found a bottle of booze in the green room and decided to chug the entire thing before going on national television. I'm sick and tired of pillow-biters not taking responsibility for their own actions.   I, for one, believe that it is the current lack of accountability in our society that has led us to where we currently are: with the cucks at the controls and the ship about to head over a waterfall.   I feel like we need to have Dr. Phil's back, here. The timing just seems to line up, perfectly. I don't watch his show, but I respect the hell out of the fact that he was willing to take on the globalist elite and their kid-diddling ring. God, I hate those people.    And fuck Todd. Boo-hoo, bitch. You got rich by winning a reality TV show and become yet another Hollywood wanna-be wasteoid. ""Wah! I spent all my money on coke and booze!"" Sorry, Todd. I acknowledge that you might have a legitimate substance-related medical condition, but I just can't feel sorry for you. Kick rocks. "
"Now they're saying that Muh Russia wasn't started because of the dossier.

You shall sustain the laws and constitution, or you shall suspend them both at our option. Which taxes as it pleases, and that without responsibility to any but stockholders. The reader can too easily divine the nature of this power, for it is now grinding America as well as England in the dust.‎""](https://ia801405.us.archive.org/28/items/sciencegovernme00roosgoog/sciencegovernme00roosgoog.pdf) -Clinton Roosevelt 1841 The science of government founded on natural law. (pg ~39)  It is the banking system.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUyWmmWtcFM"
Sorry if this is the wrong place but I just needed to yell it off a mountain. I love everyone right now. Merry Christmas to all.  Edit: thank you all very much for the nice replies and all the love! Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas!
"I am so sick of the MUH Russia narrative. I feel that even beyond the ""collusion"" accusations the idea that the Russia's meddled in our election is not fully supported in fact. Our cucked intelligence services keep asserting this in nearly every story concerning GEOTUS, Russia, or Putin in the main stream media. Am I wrong on this PEDES? Is there something I'm missing? "

Those opposed to Trump's Jerusalem decision stand with the Tiki-Torchbearers of Charlottesville.
"Where are you complacent, shortsighted Bill Mitchell-esque explain every god damn thing away as ""DONT WORRY YALL JUST 4D Chess!"" Imbeciles.  Yea the next time someone raises a valid concern about our once in a lifetime chance with this administration, don't call everyone a concern troll.

Since 1am when we passed tax reform.  So much salt my blood pressure is through the roof!!! Kek
"FBI agent Peter Strzok, advocate of the Trump/Russia conspiracy theory and the Fusion GPS dossier, has been outed as a biased Hillary partisan, removed from the investigation, and demoted. In Congress, Devin Nunes is demanding answers, and the FBI has agreed to cough up more documents.   Trump's stated view, widely shared, is that this shows the investigation is biased against him. That might well be, but what if there's more to it? Think about it: if Trump were succeeding in draining the swamp, wouldn't it look like this? *Wouldn't we'd expect to see Democratic Party partisans in the FBI being demoted?*   Maybe Mueller *really is* Trump's man. Maybe his ""biased team"" is being closely watched and have been given just enough rope to hang themselves. Maybe the reason we ""didn't hear about this when it happened"" is because it suits Trump's purposes: the Democrats still think they're winning regarding the investigation, but one of their major operatives was neutered months ago. That doesn't look like a Democratic victory to me.  I know, I know, this is more Thomas Wictor/""Trump's 6D chess"" speculation. This could all be wrong... but wouldn't it be the best timeline if this was right?"
At this point it's clear Sessions is the swamp.

Can't find the SOTU clip of that speech though.
"Do you honestly think that Trump doesn’t know what’s going on?? The libs are like a puppy that shits in your house. You take that puppy and rub it’s nose in their own shit. After a few times, the dog dislikes their nose in shit. Unfortunately, we have the shit loving Swamp/media that keeps on acting out and acting like they don’t smell the shit when in reality, they are covered in it. It’s actually astounding that the left cannot correct themselves enough to remove themselves from the bullshit. "
Does anyone have any stats/pics of NFL week 1 to show that there's been a real downturn in attendance?
"And ask for a cake saying, ""Jesus is the one true messiah. All others are heretical imitators. It is wrong to have sex with goats."" If they make it I have cake. If they don't I get free money from the lawsuit! Fool proof plan!"
"The Dems will now claim that they took the higher moral ground. Why isn't anyone discussing Bob Menendez and his trial? The details involving underage prostitutes is sickening. Franken is being thrown to the wolves but lets all remember that they all sat quiet on Bob Menendez and his shenanigans. They let Menendez sit in the Senate, comment on tax reform as if nothing happened. "
But The MSM Has Been Saying Trump Is Literally Hitler.  WTF?
If you REALLY think that the climate is changing and that there are resigning sea levels then why would a man of such unbridled genius ever decide to go and buy a house right on the ocean? The fact that the left accepts this without questioning the wisdom of such a move is laughable.

"Three times in the last week we have seen 3 bogus stories in the media.  It started last Friday with Flynn/Trump which made the stock market crash.  On Monday it was Donald Jr in the news with bad info, Now today Donald Jr is back in the news with another bogus report. Their rush to get this Fake News out has left them with egg on their face bigly this week.  Are these bad reports mistakes they are making? Or.... Has somebody figured out how to beat them at their own game?  What better way to make msn look bad then to make it self inflicted.  I've been wondering if someone is giving out false info, knowing the media will run with it.  When they are wrong it becomes Fake news, another nail in the coffin.  It could also be the result of finding leaks as well.  We know they are still looking for them.  I just find it hard to believe their hatred for him is so bad it would happen 3 times in a week.  Thoughts?"
Make sure guys and girls that when you take a picture of your guns this weekend for your Sunday Gun Day post that your gun doesn't go and shoot an innocent victim by itself like it did in San Francisco. I hear it happens these days.

And to those of you willing to let the millions of us law abiding conservatives in California slip into the ocean because of what some commies did in that shit hole, shame on you. Your Marxist indoctrinated governments, and the colleges that train these people, will do the same to you if given the opportunity. Are you willing to face prison time away from your families to stop them it because thats what it will take.   They want their pet illegals for votes and for their own army to take us out.

"It has been about a year and not one single thing of substance has been leveraged against the president. They have possibly the dumbest charge ever against Flynn, he didn't break the law in any way and is now serving months in prison. How many millions of dollars did they spend on this investigation/witchhunt?   A similar witch hunt was carried out on Scott Walker here in Wisconsin. The investigator went rampant ignoring any due process for months and months. Similarly, they found not a single thing short of a small lie here or there. They raided homes at 2 am, put gag orders on everyone and their dogs. Democrats will stop at nothing to intimidate and scilence Republicans actually doing something good. It is a disgusting abuse of power and should not be tolerated anymore! Let's do something about this asenine behavior."
FNC reporting. WASTE OF MONEY!!

"As an Australian I just don't get how the laws around immigration in the US are optional. We take our border security very seriously and both major political parties support off shore processing (use a third country like Naru) and permanently ban anyone that illegally lands on our shores looking for asylum from ever settling here. There are people who are pretend refugees that have been in detention for a number of years and will remain so until they either go home or get picked up by a third country. All this stuff about collusion in the election is total crap but there is lots of illegal immigration stuff happening every single day. Why hasn't ICE hired another 20,000 Agents and flooding these sanctuary cities?"
Donald Trump will leave the presidency having made 0 dollars (he donates his salary every quarter). Obama walked away a multi millionaire.

"I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with politicizing a tragedy.  When some attack happens to the great people of our nation it is up to everyone else to talk about it, to seek answers, and to come up with ways to prevent future attacks.

"I noticed you are selling an ""Antifa"" shirt that says ""Anti (lightning bolt) Fa"" on the front.  Am I to understand Walmart supports domestic terrorism and the pursuance of violence to silence political opposition? Taking a stand politically is dangerous for any company, but outright supporting an organization that has been known to espouse violence is downright stupid. Already there is a movement online to boycott your stores and website based on this one shirt. I know I will not be spending a dime at your stores or website until this shirt is no longer available and a statement is made apologizing for carrying it in the first place.  I have to say this is one of the most disgusting, anti-American displays I've ever seen by a mainstream retailer. I'm sure if the communist/socialist policies you support by selling this shirt come to pass, your profits would suffer horribly.  "

Since the FBI and DOJ (and their unconstitutional special prosecutor) are all obstructing justice on the clinton matter then the only way President Trump could obstruct justice is if he went along with them.
Flynn reportedly agreed to a deal because the legal bills had become too high. Is this what we can expect to see more of? The government forcing people to rack up huge legal bills fighting a witch hunt to the point where they will make a deal? This is very disturbing.

This latest surge came as the market climbed more than 200 points to open trading yesterday morning, buoyed by news from over the weekend that Republican senators had voted to pass sweeping tax-reform legislation.   &gt;It’s clear that American businesses are hungry for a 21st-century tax code built for [growth.](https://click.mail.whitehouse.gov/?qs=a5626ce2c42736340b5d2a69fab1a810d82fb9f6dfcb7cd1ef7a59e9f30945410baa6e6656800f46daa449309e2fedfdc640a34e02f11997)  &gt;Learn more.  &gt; &gt;Bonus: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [explains](https://click.mail.whitehouse.gov/?qs=a5626ce2c42736346ddb55bf8c62a06f025e1f6b9126ddad3f7536b367249ce06d7825f276d95547a97d678b8f3a498153ddad59b8c664c9)  &gt;“Tax reform: What’s in it for you.”     &gt;Fact vs. fiction on federal monuments     &gt;President Trump visited Salt Lake City, Utah, yesterday to announce two major proclamations modifying the boundaries of the [Bears Ears](https://click.mail.whitehouse.gov/?qs=a5626ce2c4273634e36f154b5390df53257031a411398ddf5e72576f4b192965a5d95d849cf472d3dcc16267d89110971bb0672a3f5e0874) and [Grand Staircase-Escalante](https://click.mail.whitehouse.gov/?qs=a5626ce2c427363478b3d6b765bb0ab3ad340f7e0670a462ef1e9797d1f9d6c1750abac72b84568369fc530aaec4236d7b4d509b5094aee2) national monuments.  &gt;As usual, there’s plenty of misinformation making the rounds. Here are a few quick facts to correct the record:   &gt;	- Myth: No president has ever shrunk a monument. Fact: Monuments have been shrunk at least 18 times—by presidents on both sides of the aisle. &gt;	- Myth: This move will sell or close national parks. Fact: No national parks are under review, and the Administration adamantly opposes wholesale transfer of any public lands. &gt;	- Myth: The review was done behind closed doors.

President Trump proclaimed December 1, 2017, as World AIDS Day, a moment to “honor those who have lost their lives to AIDS [and] celebrate the remarkable progress we have made in combatting this disease.”   &gt;Ambassador-at-Large Deborah Birx, M.D., highlighted how U.S. leadership has been the difference maker. When the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) “began in 2003, only 50,000 people were receiving lifesaving antiretroviral treatment (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa.

I literally can’t even look through my twitter without seeing something about Flynn. What in the world is going on?  Update: I found somebody on twitter that hashed everything out for me. Great guy called NavyJack.
"&gt;Flynn and Trump conspired in the crime of the century to have Russia steal a presidential election  &gt;Trump, a guy with unlimited power to pardon, and who isn't under investigation, threw Flynn under the bus to save his own hide  &gt;Flynn makes a deal with the FBI to help prosecute Trump to save his own skin  OR  &gt;Flynn is just a regular decent military dude who isn't a conniving politician and got caught up in a witch hunt organized by butthurt Democrats looking to manufacture an excuse for losing so hard while being so overconfident so as to retain a few donors while misdirecting the wheels of justice from prosecuting themselves  &gt;Wants to clear his name, but recognizes he's the centerpiece of a year-long investigation that has been hanging like a cloud over Washington for a year, hampering the implementation of an agenda he supports, and also recognizes that America is on the brink of war with a nuclear power  &gt;Decides to just go ahead and plead guilty to some bullshit to get the whole sideshow over with, knowing Trump will pardon him for a lifetime of service Flynn's statement was:  &gt;“After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of ‘treason’ and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel’s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”  If you believe the former account is true, then you have a warped view of reality and interpret real-life events through the narrative structures of Hollywood movies. People could weave up any sort of narrative based to feed you, and you'd think it true so long as the whole structure resembled the plot of a show you've seen. In other words, you're a lefty with a mental disorder."

"Think about it.  All of these anti American comments, shitting on our country, hoping for failure.  All you have to do is substitute America for your sports team if you ever want to see how this works.  You'd never tolerate a teammate who pouts in the locker room before the game and says, ""Fuck this team, I hope we lose every game for the next 4 years.""  When conservatives were pissed about Obama doing stupid shit like Obama care, it was the equivalent of bitching about the game plan, not wishing for the team to lose the game."
"1 American citizen = 1 authenticated vote.  It'll be much easier to get the point across using the term Voter Authentication than Voter ID. The latter puts the onus on the individual while the former places it on the state. Which is how it ought to be, quite frankly.  What I mean by this is America needs a better mechanism for ensuring that each Americans vote is properly authenticated. Using an ID card isn't sufficient. We need some other, easier way to control how votes are tallied.  Drop Voter ID in favor of Voter Authentication and support a reform of how we control voter fraud.  Spez: balanced 1s"
"Pedes I just called my senators and asked that they vote yes on the Jobs and Tax bill. I voted for them and reminded them of my position, military service and civic activities.   I did this because I received a text reminder from Lara Trump. Here is the script she provided:  **President Trump's historic Tax Reform plan will help create millions of jobs and deliver a pay raise for middle class families.  The House passed it and now it's up to the Senate. We need every vote possible.  President Trump wants you to call Senator Flake today!  Tell him to vote YES on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.**  #Don't wait. You will make the biggest impact by calling right NOW"

"""Later today Donald Trump is expected to make a largely symbolic but important gesture, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — not as an international capital or shared capital or capital in flux or as any of the other fantasies anti-Israel types have harbored since 1967. The most consequential long-term benefit of the move is that it begins to undercut a myth that’s stood for years.  Palestinian leadership might have deluded their own people for decades, but there is no conceivable peace deal that includes a truly divided Jerusalem. Like the Right of Return, the notion that a part of Jerusalem proper will be handed over to an antagonistic government, much less the remnants of the PLO and their on-and-off political partners Hamas, is a fantasy. This is not a radical Likud position, it’s one of the few issues that all major political parties, left and right, agree on in Israel.  Jerusalem, after all, is not some concocted modern capital. The place itself is the affirmation of the Jewish claim on Israel. Consequently, the coming protests over Trump’s move are not merely about a city, they are about challenging the right of Israel to exist — a self-destructive position that most Palestinians still embrace. This isn’t new. There has been a destructive effort within the Muslim world — although it has been taken up by others, including the United Nations — to deny the religious and historic connection between the city and the Jews. Moving the embassy, even if it entails nothing more than hanging a sign on a new building, is a pushback against attack on an ally.  That is, if you still view Israel as a close ally. Most do. Over the past 30 years, in fact, politicians keep telling voters that an undivided Jerusalem is the capital of Israel then doing nothing about it once they’re elected — and not some of them, but virtually all of them.  Bill Clinton attacked George H.W. Bush for having “repeatedly challenged Israel’s sovereignty over a united Jerusalem” and promised to back “Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.”  In 1995, the Jerusalem Embassy Act passed overwhelmingly in both the House and Senate. The law funds the relocation of the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizes the city as the “undivided” capital of Israel. Clinton balked. So George W. Bush attacked Clinton for failing to deliver and promised that he would “start the process” of moving the embassy “as soon as I’m sworn in.” He didn’t. Barack Obama, openly antagonistic towards Israel from very beginning, didn’t even bother with the fiction.  Every one of these presidents signed a waiver every six months postponing the legislation. And every one of them failed to bring about a peaceful end to the conflict or a Palestinian state, because every one of them had to deal with unrealistic stipulations from Palestinian leadership, which included a demand that Jerusalem proper be the capital of their new state.  In June, when the no one thought Trump would follow through on his promise, the Senate, including every Democrat who was there, voted to “prod” the president, as Politico characterized it, into moving the Israeli Embassy to Jerusalem. The Senate voted 90-0 on a resolution marking the 50th anniversary of Jerusalem’s reunification, calling on the “president and all United States officials to abide by” by the 1995 law and “all its provisions.”  Now that Trump is reportedly finally moving on the issue, a number of Democrats oppose the idea.""   http://thefederalist.com/2017/12/06/recognition-of-jerusalem-makes-peace-more-likely/ "

"Under federal law, any non-U.S. citizen is an alien. Aliens who have entered the United States without permission, or who have violated the terms of their admission, are identified under the law as illegal aliens. That is a fact, not an issue for debate.  The term “alien” means any person not a citizen or national of the United States. —United States Code, Title 8, §1101(a)(3)  An illegal alien…is any alien (1) whose most recent entry into the United States was without inspection, or (2) whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and—(A) whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or (B) whose unlawful status was known to the Government, before the date of the commission of the crime for which the alien is convicted. —United States Code, Title 8, §1365(b)"

The FBI using info; they knew was fake to spy on their political opponents. Strzok has refused to come to Congress three times to be questioned. Congress, specifically Nunes, are not going to be thrown off the trail. This is why Trump is so relaxed. DOJ has stonewalled, Sesssions has recused.

"Hello wonderful Patriots, today I wanted to ask for some advice on possible legal action I am planning to take against my employer. Yesterday when I clocked into work at Starbucks, my manager immediately pulled me aside and told me I was no longer an employee as someone had complained about a statement I made earlier in the month expressing my views on the god awful program known as ""DACA"". During a private conversation I had at work, I told my coworker something along the lines of, ""Fuck DACA people"". Some other coworker overheard and complained. Was I in the wrong ? Is this no longer a country where I am allowed to freely express my opinions? They gave me an official statement saying, ""Starbucks actively creates and promotes abilities, strengths and differences and promotes diversity"". Doesn't my different political view constitute as a ""difference"" protected under the very statute they took my job under? Hoping someone with more of a legal background could give me some advice before I start calling this long list of lawyers. "

Obama has been going around criticizing Trump all over the world.  He has essentially broken the tradition of former presidents keeping away from openly criticizing a sitting president.  This may be annoying for us in the short term but Trump will probably live to be 120 years old and btfo every president after him on Twitter if they don't do right by the American people!!
"Is there any way to know when the FBI/IG will finish its internal investigation into Peter Strzok and the activities that he’s connected to?  FBI Director Wray made it clear yesterday that he wont do anything until the investigation concludes.  It seems like Mueller’s probe and a reopening of the investigation into Hillary are hinging on this report.  I’m on the edge of my seat in anticipation. When is it going to happen?  The revelation that Strzok used the Steele dossier (which was funded by the DNC backed FusionGPS) to get a FISA warrant on Trump and start a year long witch hunt will be earth shattering.  (Edit: also of note, my liberal friends on social media have gone eerily quiet about the investigation recently. They know something is up.)"

"Hi  Saw the news this morning about August Ames, pornographic actress who killed herself at age 23. Dipping into the story a little bit, it seems she turned down a scene opposite a gay male performer, was [Cyber bullied](https://twitter.com/ghostinmarble/status/938607809704398848) hard over it, and ends up hanging herself over it.  I realize this walks a fine line here, but to me this is more double standard and in-fighting that makes the progressive left just an absolute shitshow. For transparency, I am a trump voter and remain a supporter over fiscal and trade policy. I do however consider myself more socially centric or even slightly left-leaning. I have some dealings in the adult entertainment world so i'm familiar with the types of people occupying it. I expect this type of behavior, but the visceral response August got I have a hard time believing.   She made the cardinal sin of speaking truths about the real issues facing the gay community and gay porn community. Aids and HIV is a real concern within that segment, and she, as noted in her last tweets, reserved the right of refusal about who was inside her body unprotected. This is obviously a lash against the gay community as a whole, despite having a record of being their ally prior.   Its absolutely disgusting to me they chose to attack her and drive her to the point of killing herself. Despite what feelings you might have about her decision or vocation or the morality of porn question, a beautiful 23 year old girl is now dead because of progressive's mob mentality over never speaking truths of the protected class. Porn girls at her level aren't what you may think, that they're simply sluts who bang their way to fame and are totally degenerate themselves. Girls at her level truly hustle, work their asses off (literally), and have to dodge drugs, violence, and daily attacks. In the face of all this, many of them remain truly professional about what they do. I digress.  You can read more on it by searching twitter and some of the backlash she got, but its just beyond me how these ""high minded"" progressives will attack one of their own to the point of suicide.   I just see this type of thing more and more. I've gotten to the point where I can't even watch my beloved ""SJW Owned Episode 47""-type videos anymore because its just so frustrating and makes my blood boil. These people don't want a discussion, they don't want a protest, they don't want compromise, they don't want anything less than a fight and to consider themselves above others to the point they'll drive someone to kill themselves. The stance i'm starting to take is that i'm going to focus on myself, my family, and my profession to become as successful as I possibly can, and hopefully when given the opportunity to counter this movement i'll seize it. Maybe that means I won't give a referral or contract to someone or help someone who is involved with this ridiculous ""movement"" of theirs, I don't know. I'm rambling. Thanks for reading, I feel truly like this is the last place on reddit this type of thing can be posted without fear of attack or deletion. "
"""Keep your plans dark and impenetrable as night, when you strike, fall like a thunderbolt"" - Sun Tzu  In the spirit of Sun Tzu, I became Hillary and Obama, felt their side.. they have not one plan but a series. The last in that series is an emergency plan, a fail-safe for them.. Turn Mueller up to 100, FORCE TRUMP TO FIRE HIM.  This is baseball folks, lawyer sports.. These fucks have spent hundreds of MILLIONS in man hours over the last year planning their case of all angles, including the fail-safe. Trump fires Mueller, their $$$ plans come to life.  We will let them READ FROM A SCRIPT..   **It is like letting Rocket Man bomb Seoul..**  *No, you don't attack him head on and let his strength stay. You attack his strength from his weakness.*  Plan A for Obama/Hillary is Mueller will bring obstruction of justice charges that a Dem controlled house (or NeverTrump house) can take and turn into 6 months of intense CNN live coverge of the ""Impeachment Hearings"" (even though they are only in the house, and are only the 1st step in a long list)   Firing Him will only STRENGTHEN THEIR CASE  It is not designed to impeach Trump at that point, just a start, the Senate has the actual trial. The House stuff is more absolute riveting theater to DRIVE HIS POLLS DOWN AND NEUTER HIM ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE (by dividing congress over support even further)   Every snoflake soyboy pussyhat will be creaming in the streets, turn into Fred Astaire and sing in the rain.. etc. CNN and the rest of MSM can go 100% FULL TIME IMPEACHMENT TALK AND COVERAGE.  YOU BRING REALITY BY WILL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WE DID THIS TO ELECT TRUMP...  &gt; IMPEACHMENT THEATER IS MEME MAGIC FOLKS   It will seriously suck big time. I lived through Clinton years, I know what CNN can turn this into. The greatest show on earth for them. Every day every min, they will grouse and grovel over every fucking detail and line item. Trust me there will be tons to talk about.   That said....  **In the world of March 2017, this could work, but 2018 is going to be a storm by the end of Jan with the Inspector General's Report of corruption in DOJ and FBI.**  This alone will warrant a new Special Counsel that will then begin to EAT MUELLER. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION.  ------------------- TL/DR  A) Fire M you play into the TRAP of Million $$ Hillary/Obama carefully laid plans (like letting Rocket Man bomb Seoul). they will be reading from their million $$ script, shit even Hillary started to leak some of this they have prepared.. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-dictator-us-president-justice-department-jeff-session-investigation-a8058821.html   B) **Use IG Report to hire SC and they go chimp-out without a fuck what to do. He will eat everything.**  Spez: Plan B has risk, ANY SC has ultimate power and can hire anyone, and can become corrupt and bias and can also run amuck and possibly find some past history in our side that can hurt us too. Many will argue end SC forever.  "

"Look at Q's most recent post:  Who is Melissa Hodgman? Company? Title? Date of promotion? Focus on the date. _____  Focus on the fucking date!

Was Melissa Hodgmans promotion a pat on the back for Peter Strzok dropping the Hillary Clinton email case? or to establish further partisanship for the reopening of the case which could of at the time seen Clinton once more face charges?"
"What if the Clinton's don't actually kill anyone?  What if they don't pull the trigger or hire assassins?  What if they just make simple requests?    The process is really simple, once you start to become close to the Clintons, they invite you to parties and events, they get you comfortable being with them and they make you feel like they are your very great friends.  You start doing favors for them, and they do favors for you.  It starts to feel like a real friendship.  Then, they ask you for larger favors that seem to be more and more unethical, and maybe they don't do as many favors for you in return, instead they start to offer you promises of future favors instead.  They begin to string you along and you feel more like the relationship isn't friendship at all.  Until one day you go to a fundraiser to tell them that you are done and that they shouldn't ask you for money or favors again, and they tell you then understand and that they are sorry to see you go.  They nod to a waiter who brings you a drink and they tell you to at least stay until the end of the party, that there are people here who you should meet.  You drink and black out.  You wake up in a strange bed and a woman with a bruised face is claiming you assaulted her.  You don't remember it.  Luckily the Clintons are willing to help you make it go away.    You start doing favors for them again and they start inviting you to more private get togethers.  You do things that make your soul vomit, but you do them because they keep making comments about how lucky you are that nobody found out about what you did.  Eventually you are completely in their web.  There are pictures of you Spirit Cooking and worse.  Until one day a representative of the Clintons comes to you and tells you that you are implicated in a horrible scandal and that it would be better if you don't testify.  They tell you that if you testify, that the prosecution will uncover other things you have done and your name will be destroyed.  They offer you an handgun registered in your name and they tell you that you should make your decision by tonight, because the police will be showing up to either find your body or arrest you.  I figure that is why there are so many suicides.  Anyone who wasn't part of their circle, I imagine they make a trapped member do the killings."

They pretend the republicans and democrats are rivals, then after the show is over they go and grab a drink together, count their money, and laugh at how dumb the American people must be. They have now been exposed. And their corrupt dealings are being aired out. That is why you see such viscous attacks on our POTUS. Like a trapped rat they are trying anything they can. Sorry �� ‘s.

Critics say President Trump shouldnt talk about the actions of the DOJ or FBI (and Special prosecutor) but since as President he is actual responsible for administering those two departments wouldnt going along with their obstruction of justice and coverup be participating in their obstruction of justice and wrong doing along with them?  HE HAS A DUTY TO SPEAK OUT AND FIX THEM.

"Media Take Out] We just got wind of some explosive accusations that are being made against one of the top hip-hop executives of the ’80s and ’90s.  A former rapper is making crazy allegations against the legendary mogul – claiming that when the exec ran one of the biggest labels in the world – he routinely forced male rappers to “s*ck him.”  The former rapper is talking to at least one major weekly gossip mag  – and he’s naming names. There are big name lawyers involved and threats of lawsuits – so we’re not naming any names.  According to the former rapper, the executive “abused” some of the biggest names in hip hop. The insider explained, “You had to have [or*l sex] with him if you wanted a record deal, and he signed some of the biggest names in hip hop.”  The rapper suggests that the mogul – who he claims is “bisexual” – enjoyed making young rappers do that. “He made us all do it, and it gave him a sense of power over us. Not just while we were doing it, but for our entire careers.”  This blockbuster report – we’re told – will be the biggest scandal in the history of hip hop. Prepare yourselves folks… it’s about to go down  "

"Notice the use of the term migrant. Migration demotes moving from one area to another, not necessarily a country. Immigration means country to country.

They’re still fucking helping trump and half of our country and most of our government officials are still arguing whether it’s even happening. Russia is about to hit us 10x as hard in 2018/20.

"So with the new year I'm getting an extra 2 weeks vacation because our company is doing awesome (thank you Trump)  Is there any place overseas (not USA) that is a cool place to visit that isn't cucked, or has roving gangs of rapist asian children?

"Someone sent this to me.  I don't know who authored it but thanks to this anon author  --- The full investigative powers of [ORDER NO. 3915-2017](https://www.scribd.com/document/348673310/Order-3915-2017-Special-Counsel) granted to Mueller actually state:  The Special Counsel is *authorized to conduct the investigation* confirmed by then-FBI Director *James 8. Comey in testimony* before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including: any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; *and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and any other matters within the scope of [28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.4)*  *The importance of noting ORDER NO. 3915-2017* specifically authorizing Special Counsel Mueller to investigate matters arising from former FBI Director Comey’s testimony on 20 May 2017, this report explains, is because during this testimony, ***Comey did, in fact, refer to Hillary Clinton’s email investigation—thus bringing this matter under the investigative powers of Mueller***—and who if he finds criminality of, then directs his actions to follow “within the scope of [28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.4)”.  With 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). being established as **“Original Jurisdiction”** for Special Counsel Mueller’s investigative mandate, this report points out, should he discover any crimes related to Hillary Clinton, he would then fall within the scope of [28 C.F.R. § 600.4(b).](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.4), known as **“Additional Jurisdiction”**—which, in turn, would then place Mueller under the ***direct control of Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions***, as this US law mandates by stating:  &gt; If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specified in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the course of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel's jurisdiction or assign them elsewhere.  Though *Attorney General Sessions* had recused himself from the **28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a). “Original Jurisdiction”** mandate of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, this report says, he is unable to do the same with the **28 C.F.R. § 600.4(b).** ***“Additional Jurisdiction” US federal law that directly puts him in charge***—and that new reports coming from the United States confirm he is doing by their showing that Sessions has, indeed, been investigating the crimes of Director Comey’s FBI and the Obama-Clinton Justice Department since he took office."

" Consider if you will, Trump has just dealt a major blow against the enemies of Christianity and Judaism by openly declaring Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. I’ve seen elsewhere on this Reddit as well as out in the open that this could be a fulfilment of prophecy, maybe even leading to the construction of the third temple.    For those who have read your Bibles, you will know that what comes next is not a pleasant time. While the book of revelations is incredibly cryptic, vague, and has the resemblance of an acid trip, once you start combining all the things that we have heard there is  something scary that has just come to my mind.   Alex Jones is only one voice among many that has openly accused the left of blatant Satanism. But given that the average human that has not given in to that kind of base  corruption backs away from that kind of thing,  what would be necessary for an antichrist like being to take over? Especially with the resurgence of faith and Judeo Christian values in the west ?   The left has begun to realize that they have lost. They are throwing everything they have at us hoping to regain control. But they have not used their most powerful weapons, their most powerful deceits.   Consider what would happen if during this golden age of resurgence in everything we hold dear, an alien mothership openly landed at the UN and claimed they were our creators?    Then consider what they would do to prove that, what kind of thing with they bring with them or actions they would take to prove not only their superiority over us but also their mastery over our very being.   MAGA  would no longer matter. Only the  staunchest of believers would ever deny that kind of evidence.  Or people who just reject being controlled. Especially when you consider what they could offer. Imagine if you will that these alien creatures offer a genetic  panacea,  A “cure“ for the human condition. Simple injection offering you functional immortality, increased intellect/wisdom, and a huge leap forward in evolution. Maybe it even changes the way you look creating something like ridges on your hands or on your fourth. Would it really be that strange to us? It’s not like the word Klingon isn’t  well known in pop culture.   Now imagine that the only way you can use their technology, the only way you can benefit from this new kind of economy  that completely takes over everything we currently use is if you accept  this injection.  Otherwise you simply don’t have the brain processing power or genetic markers to be able to use it, And the only way to qualify for this injection,  is if you reject  all “human frailties”  and silly superstitions, like  religion .   If you have read your Bible,  you understand how scary the scenario sounds?  It’s incredibly wild, but think about everything we have learned, and everything that has been hidden and only brought to light in the past two years. "

"**Argument 1**    &gt;Alabama's laws have a disproportionate impact on black voters because they are less likely to have the means (money, transportation,  hours off work) to get a voter ID.

Literally leftists are bitching that illegals or people who cannot bother at all to get an ID (which is needed for the most basic things in life) is racism and that anyone should be allowed to vote... all of this just because Mr. Roy Moore will win Alabama despite the false accusations and disinformation.

"In my opinion, this is not a good thing.   Minimum wage for little, to no working experience, are jobs that are well... *minimum wage jobs*.  What is going to happen is the bigger corporations are going to all bump up, forcing all the smaller ones as well as other businesses to follow suit. All they way down to the mom and pop shops.  *If and when* the economy weakens, the smaller ones are going to be the ones that will pay the price.  Once $15.00 ""standard minimum wage"" becomes the norm, companies and businesses will not be able to cut salary below that amount (they will be forced to terminate people) in the event of a downturn.  &amp;nbsp;  Just my two cents."

Corker was the Mayor of Chattanooga and he pulls lots of D votes. I am from NJ and after being raised as a Irish Catholic D (with Kennedy photo in the parlor) I am hardcore Trumper. My buddy grew up in NJ but his family were Yellow Dog Democrat as his father was from Miss. He went to school in TN and stayed a D. Ds in Tenn are not the psychopaths like the ones in NJ and California. So my buddy and his D friends like Corker but don't like the NY aggressiveness and rudeness of Trump. So I think Blackburn would win a primary against Corker - but Corker would win as an R big. The Ds like him. You never know who will come out of the woodwork if Blackburn runs. I say if Corker votes yes on the tax cuts we should forgive him for the dumb Iran deal and attacks on Trump and bring him back into the R camp.
"Average Dubya Bush day: Picking up brush in the woods for a photo-op. Maybe have a speech and say something funny. Spy on American people. Bomb Iraq.

Say something scripted, take scripted questions and say something that makes all the media fawn over him. Spy on American people. Bomb Iraq with drones. News coverage = ""OMG WE LOVE OBAMA MUH TINGLES IN MUH LEGZ""  Average Trump day: Repealing an overbearing regulation, bomb the shit out of Isis. Take UNscripted questions from press, media goes bananas over something he says or tweets. Takes up entire 24hr news cycle on TV and online. Huge range of media attacks all day ""Muh Russia, Muh Collusion, Muh Tax Returnz, Muh Diet Coke, Muh Two Scoops, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"". And yet, we MAGA. Every day it's a new adventure, something great happens everyday. I just wanna say this is something special.  Literally there were days during the Dubya admin where the news of the day was he picked up a bunch of sticks. That's all.  For Obama it was ""omg did you see this thing he said on youtube, he's the best omg omg omg"" leftist worship.  For Trump it's hard hitting moves, he's taking media hits. He's survived years of attacks, and he keeps pushing on. Big moves are made every day. A few days ago Jerusalem was named Israel's capital, Today his target is the FBI, yesterday was chipping away at the FCC, within a few weeks we are going to have the largest tax cut in US history. Every day is great. I'm not tired of winning. This is beyond great what we are experiencing. Daily battles and we win each one. What a great time to be alive right now."

Thus, no recount legally required, no votes recorded, Jones wins and no record of fixing.  The fix was in when Mitch McConnell suggested write ins. That was the deep state informing the public how they would win.  Even Trump specifically mentioned the write ins. Why?

Why?  Only a uni-party shill like Jeb could cement Obama's legacy by giving his policies the approval of the opposing Party.   Obama was clearly  not impressed with Hilaries performance as secretary of  state.  Obama support of Hillary was Tepid throughout most of the campaign and only after Trump secured the Republican nomination did he begin to lend his  political weight to Hillary's campaign...  Obama let the DOJ and other agencies go all out SJW  knowing that this level of racial/gender and sexual politicking would illicit blowback from main street Americans. To me This is Obama's most telling political maneuver of sabotaging Hillary.   Right now Team Clinton and Team Obama folk are at war behind the curtain for control and  Money  ooops I mean future of the Democratic party.  These are actions of competing factions not allies....

"[I posted a response to somebody describing themselves as a repressing transsexual on RightwingLGBT, I feel like I gave a good summary one why LGB is separate from T]  Ill retort with this. Homosexuality is likely caused by genetics or other factors at birth. Transsexuality is not. It's a delusion in ones own mind that they aren't the same sex in their mind as their own body. yet, they have specified chromosomes so its disabling for them to exist in their own body. No matter how much someone is fixated on their gender not correlating to their physical sex boils down to mere semantics. No matter how much a man tries, not even if they cut off their dick, wear makeup and dresses, take the best hormonal treatments and have a botemless pocket to pay for as many surgeries as they want. That man will never be a woman because when they were concieved they received the XY Chromosome and that is set in stone until the day mankind learns to rewrite DNA I will never accept modern methods as a valid form of actually changing ones own sex. I don't care if you can flip some guys dick inside out and give him functioning ovaries and they take 99-billion metric tons of estrogen, unless you can change his chromosomes from XY to XX he is still a man. Your genetics are part of what defines you and as far as we know in this day, altering those chromosomes is not possible. Should that day come then I would consider transsexuality as valid, changing genetics is the only way to FULLY transition.   All that being said, I came out when I was 10 years old as gay and trannsgender. for years I insisted upon having a sex change and was pursuing SRS by 14 years old. I smoked pot for the first time when I was 16 and realized how ridiculous it was. ""Why couldn't I lean to be happy in my own body?"" I asked myself, then proceeded to do just exactly that. There was no need for surgery, hormones or any of that stuff. All I needed was to lean acceptance.  Homosexuality, even if it weren't a genetic or an otherwise birth related disorder, isn't debilitating. So I don't have sex with or date women for pleasure. that's not a hinderance on my life. That's not going to stop me from procreating. I can have surrogates. I could have intercourse with women based only procreating, I could ever. Go to china and clone myself.  One can be content as a homosexual, the state of transsexuality is a position of discontent with ones own genetics, which cannot be changed. They may try to remedy this by making superficial changes to their anatomy but their genetics remain the same.  This is why LGB are fundamentally different from T and why T remains a mental Illness while LGB are free from that label."

"We know about Generation Z and it's right wing leanings, but let's analyze why that is happening.  As technically a Millennial myself, we are going from probably the most sheltered generation into the least... Here's why.  The 90s gave birth to a new type of parenting: Helicopter parents who formed a complete bubble around their children from being harmed. No physical abuse from teachers, no dangerous sports, no dangerous playground equipment, no schoolyard fighting under penalty of expulsion. Even going so far as to shut down any mental harm. No more bullying in school, no name calling, parents aren't allowed to tell their children anything in fear of hurting their development or being labelled bad parents from their peers. Trophies for losing were handed out. No consequences for losing in video games. Asking permission and worrying about everyone's feelings for any and all decisions.   In the workplace, because we were never pushed too hard or reprimanded for not completing a task... suddenly droves of Millennials cant handle the criticism that comes along with working.   Suicide numbers go up and bullying apparently goes down. What's going on? The children were so protected from bullying growing up that they can't handle it when they get to high school. What's worse, if they didn't experience it in high school they aren't tough enough to cope with it in the work place or in college.    So what happened between Millennials and Generation Z? The evolution of the internet. We've now gone from the most sheltered and protected generation in history to the LEAST.  Think about it, at an extremely young age, Gen Z'ers were thrown into a world of completely unfiltered mayhem. Younger than any generation prior in the history of civilization, could Generation Z be exposed to hardcore porn, bullying from adults, racism, sexism... you name it. Generation Z are some bad mother fuckers, because they have been constantly dealing with online bullies and trolling since as young as the age of 5-7. On the internet there is no protection from trolls or bullies. You are fighting with people who may be as much as 3-4 times your age, telling you to ""kill yourself faggot."" Think about it, they all play video games while chatting online with people three times their age hurling the worst insults imaginable at them. Imagine being exposed to that at 5. These people don't take shit from ANYONE.  They also have more access to information than anyone prior, they can instantly tell lies from truth by googling it. News media has nothing on Gen Z... they are savvy to the bullshit. That's why they are proverbially ""Woke"".  What happens when you get the most sheltered generation of all time? The yin to their yang... the least.   Generation Z is coming and they are going to absolutely fuck up Millennials. I can say that as a Millennial."

WTF I hate keeping my own money now?!
"As a teenager I was a VERY serious musician. Practice 2-4 hours a day type. I went to a special Fine Arts high school, and we took music very seriously, as did the other departments of the school.  Now I'm going to share with you a story and a fact that will seem somewhat contradictory.  During my time at school we hosted a 5th-6th grade band and orchestra from Hong Kong, right about the time of the government switch-over. They were the most amazing band that age I had ever seen - they rivaled even some of OUR high school level bands. We were all blown away. Afterwards, we spoke with some of them who spoke English and asked about what their lives are like. They explained that their parents decided when they were very young that they were going to be musicians and chose their instrument. From that young age they practice with nearly all of their free time, and they see a private instructor almost daily. Mistakes and laziness were often met with corporal punishment. Rehearsals were, likewise, exacting and grueling. This led to their technical marvel.  That was the story, now here is the fact.  Major symphony orchestras around the world hold open, blind auditions. They do not have racial, gender, nationality quotas of -ANY- type. It is pure meritocracy. You can be from anywhere in the world. The candidates come in and do not speak, perform the audition behind a partition, and are assigned a number. Best person gets the job. Now the story would lead you to believe that (classical) musicians from Eastern countries would absolutely dominate the worlds high level orchestras. But they don't.   If you look at many of the top orchestras - for example the Dallas Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Chicago Philharmonic, they do not dominate, especially outside of the violin section. Americans do.   I knew that fact going into the story I experienced earlier, and it just confused me. It didn't make any sense. Finally I called up an old private teacher of mine who, himself, played in a major orchestra. I asked him what gives.  I will never forget his answer.  He told me to imagine two people, an American named Sue and a girl from Hong Kong named Kim.  They both pick up the violin at the age of 5, and Sue puts in about 20 minutes a day, soon 30, and by the time she's 7, an hour. During this time, Kim has been putting in 4 or more hours.  Sue, in addition to her serious violin study, joins the Girl Scouts and plays soccer, Kim is spending that time practicing.  At age 13 Sue breaks a leg mountain biking, and spends the whole summer sad, in a cast. Kim ain't got time for mountain biking.  At 16, Sue gets her first boyfriend, and falls deeply in love with him. Well, teenage love, which can be pretty intense. She's happier than she's ever been. A year later, they break up she is heartbroken. Kim is not allowed to date.  At 17, Sue's soccer team wins state. She is elated. Kim was given a 98/100 on an important audition, and is punished.  Both girls go to college for violin. All up to this point, both girls have taken violin very seriously. Sue is now practicing as much as Kim, but is 1,000-2,000 raw practice hours behind her.   Sue enjoys college, meets a boy on the lacrosse team, and their relationship is rocky for a while. She finds out about some personal struggles he is coping with, and helps him overcome them. At 21, Sue is married. Also at 21, Kim marries a man her parents have chosen for her.  They both enter and complete grad school for violin performance.  A seat at a major orchestra opens up. The kind of opening that could be life changing. People fly in from all over to audition. Both girls, not aware of each other's existence, auditions for the spot. Competition is fierce.  Part of the audition is very technical. Both girls excel, but Kim edges her out at an almost imperceptible level. They are the head of the pack, though.  Another part, sightreading. They both nail it.  Finally, there is an expressive piece. Say, an excerpt from Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, a heartwrenching piece of music often known to drive people to tears. (The sad string piece from the film ""Platoon""). A piece like this requires a level of expressiveness, but is not all that technically difficult. Sue has had ups and downs. A full life. Love and heartbreak. Friends and varies experiences that Kim couldn't really relate to. She sometimes fought with his parents and argued with her teachers, something Kim wouldn't dare to do.   In short, Sue had the freedom to live a full life, warts and all. An American life. The kind of thing Kevin Arnold got during the run of The Wonder Years. Lots of good, lots of bad, some great, and some rock bottom.   Sue wins the part, because people do not pay tickets to go see a player piano, which plays perfectly every time, but couldn't move your bowels after Thanksgiving dinner..  Our children, our teenagers, and quite frankly our citizens, are less respectful than some. They can be more disobedient, and more defiant. They are also more imaginative, and they are dreamers. They are more entrepreneurial, and are more willing to take a risk. They are more expressive, and free. Freedom of expression, the first thing guaranteed to us by the Constitution of United States of America. Maybe this is why we gave the world jazz, a distinctly American artform.  This all happened nearly two decades ago, and I never forgot it. This is one of the reasons I love America."

"Add this to term limits.  The pleading of the 5th has to go.  They can use it on everything, no matter what, even if they aren't hiding a crime.  If you have to plead the 5th as a government employee, you should be terminated instantly because we can't fucking trust you.     Are we going to make government workers be held to the same standard as citizens?  A citizen doesn't have a trillion dollar behemoth to defend them from accusations, while the government can force unlimited accusations against the citizen.  The balance for their power needs to be an increased requirement for disclosure.   Lerner should be in a jail cell, not retirement.  Holder should be in a jail cell, not advocating for crap in California.     If you want to build trust in government again, then start by shining a light.  A light that can't be turned aside with an amendment loophole designed to protect witnesses in service of greater justice that is being used to enable and further corruption."

"If you didn't know why many on this sub are turning against net neutrality, here is a quick breakdown   Section 1 &amp; 2 of the Sherman Act  Section 3 of the Clayton Act  Section 5 of the FTC Act   Selective throttling and internet ""pay to play"" is literally a Federal crime and has been for decades.  The truth is NN under Title 2 actually allowed monopolistic practices and less innovation.

"New information has been discovered about parties surrounding the anti-Trump dossier.  After a senior DOJ employee was demoted last week when it was learned he had meetings with the men responsible for the dossier, it has now been discovered the DOJ employee had even closer ties.   The DOJ official's wife worked for Fusion GPS during the 2016 election.  https://twitter.com/foxnewspolitics/status/940338077305835520   foxnews.com reports: A senior Justice Department official demoted last week for concealing his meetings with the men behind the anti-Trump “dossier” had even closer ties to Fusion GPS, the firm responsible for the incendiary document, than has been disclosed, Fox News has confirmed: The official’s wife worked for Fusion GPS during the 2016 election.  Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr’s duties – including whether she worked on the dossier – remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects. HPSCI staff confirmed to Fox News that she was paid by Fusion GPS through the summer and fall of 2016."

There is no global warming. It's just a cash grab with fake studies.
"Back in 1825 a man named Sir Walter Scott published a book called *The Talisman*. This was a book about the Crusades that was widely popular at the time and romanticized the Crusades as an incident of barbaric Christians invading the land of peaceful Muslims.   This book was widely popular in its own right but also inspired a man you probably recognize named Ridley Scott. In 2004 Ridley Scott produced a film called *Kingdom of Heaven* which depicted a highly fictionalized version of the Battle of Hattin and the lives of Balian of Ibelin and Saladin.   The film was so heavily based on a fictional romantic depictions of Medeival Muslims that it was panned *badly* by critics for portraying ""Osama bin Laden's version of history"".   Both *Kingdom of Heaven* and *The Talisman* are academically debunked as bad history that do not properly convey the complexities of the time but oversimplify by portraying the Muslims of the age as a peaceful, romantic people and the European Crusaders as zealous murderous bloodthirsty goons. But unfortunately, the damage was done and both left cultural impressions insisting that the times were simple and the Crusades were about Christian bloodthirst.   That book and that movie, and of course many like it, are a large part of where ""WHAT ABOUT THE CRUSADES?!"" comes from. It is bad history. Anyone who depicts the Crusades as simply an incident of Christians invading the Muslim lands doesn't know their history.   Following this is a series of quotes from various historians on the matter.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  &gt;Given events in the modern world it is lamentable that there is so large a gulf between what professional historians know about the Crusades and what the general population believes. This movie only widens that gulf. The shame of it is that dozens of distinguished historians across the globe would have been only too happy to help Scott and Monahan get it right. -- **Thomas Madden, 2005**  &gt; ""The plot is complete and utter nonsense."" -- **Professor Jonathan Riley-Smith, Cambridge University, 2004**  &gt; ""The Templars as 'baddies' is only sustainable from the Muslim perspective, and 'baddies' is the wrong way to show it anyway. They are the biggest threat to the Muslims and many end up being killed because their sworn vocation is to defend the Holy Land."" -- **Dr. Jonathan Philips, London University, 2004**  &gt;Prof Riley-Smith added that Sir Ridley's efforts were misguided and pandered to Islamic fundamentalism. ""It's Osama bin Laden's version of history. It will fuel the Islamic fundamentalists."" -- **Charlotte Edwardes, 2004**  &gt;It does not do any good to distort history, even if you believe you are distorting it in a good way. Cruelty was not on one side but on all. -- **Amin Maalouf, 2004, French historian and author of The Crusades Through Arab Eyes**"
Trump never fails.
So we all know about North Korea and how stupid they are. But my question is why in the world do I keep hearing crap about Russia and China? Some news channels make it sound like we are calling out Russia and China even know last time I checked President Trump had good talks and visits with Russia and China.

"Seriously I have some leftist in my life that I like, dare I say love. I think Trump having what looks to them like an ongoing challenge that he ""could"" lose and they ""might"" win, keeps them from going off the edge of the cliff. Ohhh no you almost had it! Got be faster next time."

I'm not gonna make any friends with the following statement, but I feel it needs to be said: if you're still scared or uncertain about another liberal fear campaign, and if you've been on this Earth for more than 20 years, you deserved a smack upside the head.  /rant"

I usually claim 0 on my w2 then claim my kids and wife to get as much as I can back at the end of the year. I also own a home with a value of 360k will this reform mean this year I get more money back or less? Or will it not affect me this year?

President Trump will sign a massive tax cut into law, we all get an immediate personal tax break in February, the United States openly and successfully pursues energy dominance, regulations have been slashed and there's no stopping in sight, our embassy got moved to Jerusalem and our UN ambassador openly tells the collection of snivelers that call themselves nations to get fucked, manufacturing is on fire, investment is flooding back into the country, companies are just handing hundreds of thousands of employees $1000 bonuses... Oh, and we're taking back space. Space! it goes on and on. I have to admit, I'm definitely not tired of winning but I am kind of getting a little lightheaded with it all. I can't wait to talk to my expat friends from other (non-based) countries over the holidays and hear their lamentation. These days when they complain about the US I openly laugh at them and tell them they're losers from loser countries, that feeling they feel is called losing and we don't do that, and when they are prepared to rediscover and defend their culture's values they're welcome to join us as allies and winners but until then they need to hang their heads like the betas they are and keep their opinions to themselves, because America is back, bitches.   A very merry Christmas to all you 'pedes!"

"I just want to thank all of you for your hard work. I am so happy to discover such an organic movement like this. T_D is truly a place for truth. I feel like we police each other more than any other community on reddit and for that I am thankful.   This year my wife and I had our first child. I have never been more confident in our future than I am right now. This is such an exciting time seeing my 401k bounce back and now witnessing the tax cuts and jobs act. I have a great feeling 2018 is going to be even bigger.   My resolution this year is to stand up more and more for our american principles. That means different things to a lot of people, yes. My biggest concern though, is how trump supporters are still portrayed so negatively. To me, I really want to show everyone how honest, hard working and generous but fair we are. In other words I am not going to be combative when arguing points anymore. Im also not going to be angry at someone because they have a different perspective. Im so tired of the visceral hatred from the left and this ""people will die"" mentality is so unfortunate. Considering what this presodent is upagainst.. wow. What a time to be alive!  The argument over the tax bill is just a matter of difference in philosophy between the left and right. Im not afraid of point that out anymore. Im not afraid to say I agree with our president on border security. And NO, securing the border has nothing to do with racism. Im not afraid to say voter fraud is real and voter ID is a good thing... Im not afraid to say voter ID has nothing to do with racism. Im also not afraid to calmly explain why. Im not afraid to explain why the economy will not destroy the environment or explain why a strong economy is so important for our inner citys to bounce back with better schools and safer streets. Im not afraid to say that owning a gun is the highest of all trusts the government can have in its people and the ultimate right of every person. And NO that is not rugged individualism of some backward mentality. I am not afraid to raise my daughter as the wonderful girl she is. And NO, I'm not pressuring her to be ""cisgendered"". I think our police have an extremely difficult job and are under constant attack. This needs to stop and Im not afraid to defend them when they certainly deserve to be defended. I am not afraid to pray and NO I am not stupid for believing prayer works.  I just want this country to be one again. I dont care what your orientation is. I dont care what your religion is. I dont plan on raising my kid to judge you either. So please in 2018, lets finally find some common ground and lets MAGA.  "

I don't know what people mean when they say we are being brigaded.
My wife and I welcomed our first child (son) into this world earlier this year. This Christmas has gone nowhere near our plans (drove 5 hours to spend it with the in laws...they got the flu on our 2nd day there...drove home to our area that was getting first snow of the year). Son had his first Christmas Eve dinner at an Elmer’s we stopped at on our drive home. Got home and put him down.   Now he and I are up playing waiting for Mom to get up who probably got sick from family and just wanted to say...  Merry Christmas!! This didn’t go as planned but it’s been great! We’re going to do our planned Christmas gathering when everyone’s feeling better and spend this one as the three of us.   This Christmas has been great.
My boss is giving everyone YUGEEEE Christmas bonuses since the tax plan passed and after January 1 she is raising our hourly wage. THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

Obviously, this gives the left all the ammo in the world to call Trump literally hitler, so what gives?  Spez, cbs article http://archive.is/ZK96z"
"I had nothing to do today, except for make a trip into the valley for something I ordered. Decided to hop over to the big mall and look for some good deals and see how things were rolling a few days before Christmas. I had no reason to go, my shopping was done a while ago, I put more effort on the effect of gifts then the value or cost. This is a total leftist crap part of Cali that I have to drive about an hour:15 to. I could have done anything else but go to the mall with a bunch of youngins.  The mall was jammed packed and some lines at registers were very long. I heard the words ""Merry Christmas"" about every few minutes all over the mall. Cashiers saying it, customers saying it. I am not a huge religious guy either but it did feel good hearing that positive message being said by random people all over.  This mall would be considered very ""diverse"" by lefist standards, and I noticed one huge thing, not one negative thing about the new tax structure and I did have a few conversations about how the new tax plan has allowed some to already spend more this Christmas.   People from all walks of life are happy and spending money this year, and it showed today for sure. I ended up spending a few hundred on some last minute things for the family, but the trip was worth hearing and feeling the vibes from everyone.  ### MERRY CHRISTMAS"
She was in complete agreement that there is a concerted effort. It felt so good to tell her about ShareBlue and Soros. I'm glad I have the r/the_donald that had taught me about these things.   Thank you everyone. And Merry Christmas!
No. Seriously.  I just kicked chrome to the curb.  Cautiously optimistic. 
Whatever they accuse you of are what they are doing themselves
"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the land,  The swamp creatures were worried, cause a line has been drawn in the sand.  The indictments were sealed and sent to the courts,  Plans being made to cut off escape and cancel passports.  The people were all nestled all snug in their beds,  While visions of freedom danced in their heads.  Trump in the White House and Kelly guarding the gate,  History in the making with WAR declared on the deep state.  When out on the lawn at Langley there arose such a clatter,  The media tried to ignore it but Patriots know what’s the matter.  The shadow government being invaded by the Marines,  Bound and determined to restore the Republic by any means.  Documents and computers and hard drives, too,  Evidence and proof of treason collected and the JFK coup.  Time is counting down on these long time traitors,  Draining the swamp of these dangerous gators.  While the media and their lapdogs try to cover it up,  We’re finding out the “Russian collusion” was just a setup.  Not surprising given the Clinton crime family’s treason,  The depth and breadth of the deception is beyond reason.  As Santa checks his naughty and nice list for the holiday season,  The overriding theme of the naughty list is high treason.  At the top of the list, it’s replete with ex-Presidents,  Soon, they will be calling prison their new residence.  Followed closely by the cabal infested DOJ and FBI,  No longer will the country and Trump turn a blind eye.  Their dastardly deeds are being exposed,  The will of the people will soon be imposed.  The witch hunt continues, looking for Russian collusion,  The people know by now, it’s all an illusion.  The only collusion that’s being exposed is by the deep state,  Ironically, the people have woken up and will no longer take the bait.  The cabal controlled media bears much of the blame,  They’ve become so desperate, they’re all without shame.  Continuing to push their insane fake news narrative,  Charging them as conspirators has become imperative.  Further west can be found more names on the list,  Realizing predators and pedophiles are in our midst.  Yes, Hollywood is the target of much attention,  Their undoing is by their own invention.  As Santa closed the book, a tear rolled down his cheek,  He knew this is a time not for the timid or weak.  The US should be the strongest on the block,  But under Bush, Clinton and Soetoro has become a laughingstock.  He wiped the tear and looked up to speak,  He knew his words must be strong and not weak.  Now was the time to invoke his reach,  He gathered himself and began his speech.  “We must protect our children throughout the land,  If we fail them that, then we’ve had a hand.  In the despicable destruction of our own nation,  For its time we find our higher vibration.  And gather together in person and online,  To rid this scourge and begin to shine.  The light on the traitors and pedophiles, too,  The responsibility to take back our Republic is all on you.”  He paused for a moment and gave it some thought,  And recalled with a growl what the predators have wrought.  A nation deceived and a world denied,  It’s time to stand tall for those who have died.  “Gather your children and friends all around,  In your states, cities and all over town.  Unite together and always stand strong,  The abuse and destruction has gone on for too long.  Save your children and your souls before it’s too late,  There’s still a chance this world can be great.”  With that he rose and climbed into his sleigh,  He hoped the citizens would soon find a way.  To rid themselves of the pestilence, fraud and pain,  And in so doing they would have much to gain.  He had packages to deliver and good will to spread,  As he prompted the reindeer and up went the sled.  He smiled and gave all a big wave as he rose out of sight,  “A Merry Christmas to ALL and to all a good night.”"

"....considering they have actually colluded with the Russians for political gain. In 1992, after the fall of Soviet Russia, the Times of London found a memo between Russian leaders discussing a 1983 letter from Teddy Kennedy to then Russian leader Y.V. Andropov. The letter discussed how Teddy would help the Communists with Reagan if they would help the Democrats defeat Reagan for the 1984 election.  So there you go. The Dems know a thing about colluding with Russia. Let's hear them out here. "
"This keeps getting shadowbanned, likely has some truth to it, no idea how much but I'm definitely curious on how much the deep state gained from WW2 and importing all the Nazi scientists.

"Found article, very informative. Showing that the origin of Steele dossier is from Washington Post reporters and not in any way from Russia or her agents.  http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/251897/obama-steele-dossier-russiagate"
"President Trump has initiaited everything I elected him to do except fix healthcare. Now is the time to deregulate it and stop letting medical providers regulate medical care and allow non medical competitors of different types and open drug trials without FDA approval as long as all data is provided in real time to an informed public so they can assess drug trial risk themselves. This include youth extension genetic techniques.  Its time to allow people who havent been to medical school to be allowedto offer alternative care. Do that and scientists in silicon calley will have AI doing much bette r and faster  and cheaper medical care than docotrs can provide. Machining robots will do surgery far better and faster.   We have to stop letting antiquated doctors trinaied 40 yrs ago decide who and how americans will be treated...especially since their goal is to preserve their control and their high profits.   And its time to end the FDA control of the drug development process. It stinks. It doesnt produce safe treeatments. It doenst produce effective treatments. It preserves monopolies. It excludes inexpensive trestments.  Any new treatment ..including drugs or robotic surgery or AI diagnosis or genetic treatments...should be allowed for any disease or condition including health improvement and anti aging with the following conditions: all data regarding testing including previous animal and human testing is available in real time with weekly updates for the public to see so that potential users of the treatment can see it and make their own risk decisions. This would ensure fast, cheap indentification of new safe and or dangerous treatments immediately. Anyone should be allowed to participate in the treatment for as long as they continued be auto monitored and reported weekly so the sum total of statistical results are available to everyone weekly.  If this happened we would have new positive  treatments emerging in literally weeks and bad treatments  identified just as quickly.  And the choice of treatments would always be with the patient. They woukd get to make their own risk and reward decisions and would not be prohibited from doing so.  The FDA doesnt protect against unsafe things and stops many new developments and makes everything far too expensive. The FDA has no reason to exist since they dont do their primary mission.   The support for this type of plan is overwhelming from every political group.. Everyone wants it except the medical providers. "

Consider this.. the House of Saud kidnapped a Palestinian billionaire and summoned Abbas to Saudi Arabia to set him straight. Abbas wasnt even at the UN. He was getting his ass handed to him by the Prince. 
my apologies one and all. i was running around yesterday cooking and getting the house ready for my kids and friends. did not want to miss wishing each and every one of you glorious red pilling bastards a very Merry Christmas from your based friends up north.  ps...BEST.PRESIDENT.EVER  pps...Bill Clinton is a rapist  ppps...his name is Seth Rich
This is what happens when you take a person with a vendetta for white people and a chip on her shoulder and put her in a position of power. I've met many people exactly like this and they're the ugliest most hateful people to work with. They all go sideways on power trips.  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/27/rep-sheila-jackson-lee-once-named-meanest-member-congress.html
"Thank all of you Patriots fighting the good fight online, in your communities and all across the country/world. Breaking through the liberal brainwashing wasn't easy and I feel truly alone in my support for our President and beautiful country. None of my friends or family will even listen to my opinion on politics because my sources don't include the legacy media like fake news CNN. Gets depressing seeing the horrors and corruption most of the masses are blind to or even defend. Thanks again r/the_donald for giving me a home/family I can be proud of the last couple of years. Love all of you pedes. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN����"
Then Obama makes a trip there (violating the Logan Act) and a month later China is stabbing the US in the back and illegally selling oil to North Korea??? I mean common.. 
I work in financial services for trucking companies. A couple months after the election I noticed way more trucks on the road and our numbers going up.   This is normally a slow time for us but this year we are overloaded.  Who else is seeing record growth in the last year? MAGA
"Don't force your anger at them. Don't cause a mob to ""primary"" them as I have seen on this thread. Force your anger at the local and state officials. Get Republican Majorities in the state houses, state senates, and have them craft legislation to finally lower the state taxes. Get local mayorships and county executives to be republican to get the local taxes down as well.   Go back to a Reince way of building up Republicanism after the 2012 loss. I think we lost sight that we always bragged about grabbing 1000 state seats under Obama. We need to that some more under Trump to really be able to make MAGAnomics go throughout this country, even in the deep blue states.   For example in my home state of New York, and more specifically on Long Island, Lee Zeldin and Peter King are great people, very pro-Trump, and extremely pro-MAGAnomics. Us Trump supporters have to face it, my taxes are going up here on the Island where these two guys are from. We have too high of SALT to do anything with this tax bill unfortunately.   Look where these people voted no from, California, New Jersey, and New York. It wasn't like Oklahoma or some deep red state like that. State and Local taxes are through the roof in these states, including my home state.   That is where the blue state tax cuts come from, plus we get to have more Republican influence, and maybe try to make general elections a bit easier to win too for the Republicans. "
"Water is becoming more and more scarce, we haven't had a real meal in a week. Today my wife's son looked at me and asked when he will be able to eat again. I couldn't answer."
My wife and I have been living pay check to paycheck  raising our young daughter for the last year or so.  I saw an article yesterday that upset both of us.    Can't find it again after looking for it but I believe it was the daily caller.  Journalists talking about how $100 a month doesn't make a big difference to lower middle class families. Well I'm here to tell you they are wrong.   $100 a month would get us 3 fill ups of our gas tank  1/2 our electric bill A weeks worth of groceries and dinners Christmas presents for immediate family. Multiple doctor visits for any of us. Or simply the comfort of putting it into savings for a rainy day emergency.  These elitists living comfortably in their Manhattan townhouses have no sense of reality of what a seemingly small amount of extra money can do for a struggling family.  They scoff at an extra $1200 a year while me and my wife are thanking the lord for the extra stability it provides for our family.  Thanks for listening and Merry Christmas you nimble navigators 
"[Salty tears,](http://archive.is/0szIk) from the media who unfairly attack the President 24x7. "
I like it but can’t we get more? 2% but why not 10 or 15% tax cut. Would that at all be feasible? Is it because the Dems would never sign off on that?
I posted a bunch of pro conservative posts like Socialism is bad and you should be in barge of your own healthcare and birth control. This one liberal keeps angry reacting and commenting how socialism is great. I don’t think she quite understands how stupid she sounds. MAGA!
"...about how great a job Trump is doing and how lucky we are Clinton wasn't elected. She threw out such wonderful terms as ""Benghazi"" and ""best president in modern history"" and ""Bohemian Grove.""  Also, the company president often comes in with a made-in-the-USA MAGA hat. I really like my job, you guys."
If you google(or duckduckgo) the 'British ambassador Lebanon' none of the MSM news articles about the killing mention rape or the reason why she was killed like the breitbart article.   they are sweeping this under the rug folks. They won't tell you why she was killed.

"We cannot let these ungrateful, Trump- and America-hating illegal barbaric leftist cucktards stay in our beautiful country.  They are drug pushers, murderers, and rapists (some may be good people).

"Every article which I posted from here to Twitter, failed. Twitter wouldn’t allow them on is why. They are now the police of free speech. F them."
"Hey, can we start labeling the Left as “christianphobic” when they claim to think Christians hate all gays and want them dead?   Seems fair. "
"I mean, I love having a job first and foremost, but all these threads about other corporations sharing their tax breaks with the people who helped vote them into reality, and knowing that I wont get one is a little sad this holiday season."
Fuk em am I right?
Latest 'International Migration Report 2017' by UN says largest number of international migrants - 49.8-mn or 19% of global total reside in United States. Yet globalist pseudo-liberals oppose Trump.   So much hue and cry despite Obama toeing Trump's line when in power. See the video for reference - https://twitter.com/zlando/status/924891632549421056
"Hey 'pedes, looking for a good, long, compilation video of Trump's presidency in 2017.  Lots of stuff on youtube from his campaign, but surprisingly difficult to find a compilation of clips from the year that was.    I'm hoping to see the entire cast, Bannon, Spicey, the Mooch, Sarah, and all.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!"
"Hey guys! I don't know if any of you pedes remember me or Bo, but I was the guy posting on here when he made the front page. Bo made national news by sitting at a round table with Crooked Hillary when she came to town and confronting her about comments on putting coal miners out of work.   He and I just saw each other a couple of days ago after my grandfather fell very ill (we're first cousins) and he told me the story of praying to God and asking for a sign as to whether he could run. The next day he received a letter from Alabama (one of you?) asking him to run.   Anyways, he's obviously a family man and really cares about the people of WV. He loves our GEOTUS and has been on the Trump Train for a long time so I was hoping we over here at T_D could show him some love!   Check out his website here: http://www.boforwv.com Follow him on Twitter!: @MinerBo85 And check out the video of he and Hillary here: https://youtube.com/watch?v=wyZLOoHddLM   Maybe I could even get him to do an AMA if you guys were interested!"
It has been 3 months now since the largest mass shooting in modern US history and we dont know anything new about what really happened. President Trump needs to get involved.
That is all
That guy is a beauty!  Keep up the great work
Once you see it it won't go away.
"Never give up.  They accused him of sexism, racist, homophobia, the bogeyman (Russia) to get rid of him. But he never stopped fighting: that's what I learned from Trump.  You can't please everyone and never stop fighting."
This pede isn't tired of winning yet.  That is all.
"You idiots are now forced to oppose the liberation of women in one of the most oppressive countries on the planet BECAUSE TRUMP IS FOR IT. **&lt;== read it slowly and think about how fucking stupid you are you soulless shit heads**  **As usual, you are the opposite of what you think you are. YOU ARE DISGRACEFUL CUCKS and whatever moral High Ground you thought you had is now a steaming pile of shit.**  WAKE UP!"
"What I don't know for sure, but can guess:  In this Mueller investigation, the first thing I'm guessing he would have done is taken a look at Trump's tax returns.  Credit where it's due:  *If they got the returns,* the FBI should be commended on their vast improvement on ""leakage time.""  They've made it weeks - perhaps months! - without leaking sensitive information.  This is a marked improvement!"

Thank you! I get to keep more of my hard earned money!
......did you even consider this? That this is exactly what Trump wanted because now the whole Russia investigation will be exposed for the hoax it was from the beginning?  What are you going to do when the Judge throws it out because the evidence was gathered under false pretenses?

A health insurance mandate is either an employer or individual mandate to obtain private health insurance instead of (or in addition to) a national health insurance plan.
"What if he's negotiating to trade secret/valuable information he had access to as POTUS for safe harbor should the hammer come down? Maybe blackmailing some of these leaders (pizzagate?) into forcing safe harbor for him and/or others? Warrants are issued and suddenly Obama ""dies"" somehow (plane crash, boating accident...something that doesn't require bodies) and years later someone posts pics from their vacation and in the background is Barry Soetoro living it up in a foreign country.  Maybe my tinfoil hat is on too tight?"

"Like Visa. Like Twitter. If you are a platform, you don't stop a legal transaction from going through the platform, or network. Visa doesn't stop a transaction between two conservatives.

"The most recent one is about a black kid getting into Harvard.  Of course it's on the front of r|videos, but when sorting through controversial, we are seeing people pointing out Affirmative Action to 100+ scores, while the people defending it go to -20 or more.  The mods eventually locked the thread, and in a thread like that, that is a major win.  Keep at it. "

"Hello all, I recently discovered that I might not be able to be around supporting our God Emperor much longer (I assure you, I will keep supporting him where i'm located).

So does this final passed version of the tax bill eliminate the obamacare mandate? An earlier version did.   Edit: according to reports yes but not until 2019  &gt;mandate repeal would not go into effect until 2019.  Edit: anyone know for certain? Can we find bill text that covers this? Any other health insurance health care related provisions?

"“When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public’s safety at risk. San Francisco’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.  “While the State of California sought a murder charge for the man who caused Ms. Steinle’s death—a man who would not have been on the streets of San Francisco if the city simply honored an ICE detainer—the people ultimately convicted him of felon in possession of a firearm. The Department of Justice will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens. I urge the leaders of the nation’s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.”  "

"I know it’s a rabbit hole but it’s not that deep. In any criminal case you have to prove probable cause for any evidence discovered by a warrant. Many cases have been tossed for inadequate probable cause.  I know I’m dumbing it down for some. Most of us here know the FISA was obtained for political espionage and for the later hope of building a case on parallel construction based on info provided by the wiretap.   We know Flynn was unmasked, and not for a call they thought he would make, but rather on a bullshit dossier. Here’s a couple questions. Did Flynn know he was tapped? Did Rodgers spill the beans? Rodgers met with Trump a month before the Flynn call.  Wouldn’t it would be a total mind fuck if this is what pops the lid off the political espionage end of the Obama/Clinton wiretap? Because it could be. "

"The Trump administration is dramatically scaling back U.S. refugee resettlement efforts, according to a Thursday Reuters report.The move comes months after the White House announced plans to significantly curb refugee admissions and to more carefully vet new entrants to the country. In a Dec. 1 meeting, State Department officials reportedly told nine refugee agencies that resettlement offices throughout the country will not receive federal authorization to resettle nearly as many people in 2018.  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/22/trump-admin-orders-sharp-drawdown-us-refugee-resettlement-report.html"
"Context: so my high school teacher assigned me a online discussion assignment where we would discuss our thoughts on a quote. He gave us this quote without telling us who it was from. ""Americans must solve common problems, not reinforce differences in political, racial or ethnic identity."" Did some digging, and found out it was from Bill Clinton. He gave me the quote knowing I would respond positively then reveal it was from Bill Clinton. here is my response the whole class can view, ""I absolutely agree! People who make people focus on our differences like race, sex, and religion rather than what makes us similar as Americans are trying to drive everyone apart, Not bring them together to solve problems. I believe that now more than ever it is best to come together as Americans under nationalism and put aside meaningless labels such as race and sex. Thus why I am against the Marxist ideas of Identity politics and intersectionality in the modern era. Instead it is best to come together as individuals and teat each other as fellow Americans and discuss ideas, values, and beliefs in a civilized way for a better future. yes I know this was a quote from Bill Clinton who I despise and think is a bad model for the merits of this quote. A better model for this quote would be Milo Yiannopoulos who says ""The way to go is to remind them and yourselves that you should aspire to values and to ideas. You should be focusing on what unites people and not what drives them apart. And you shouldn't care about skin color, sexuality, gender, and you should be deeply suspicious of the people who do."" In short I agree with the merits of the quote but disagree with the context they were used. Furthermore Bill Clinton is a rapist www.infowars.com""  (Update: It has been brought to my attention, that the quote that I posted was not from bill Clinton, but Dr. pinker's  of Harvard university. I have ascribed ill intentions to my history professor which was not intended. I have most certainly learned a valuable lesson.  I have made my history teacher a victim of fake news and am deeply sorry.) "

"I am not taking sides, just pointing out several incorrect things I saw on the other SubReddits  1. The Victim was not ""a kid"" he was 26.  2. The Victim clearly reached behind his back a second before he was shot.  3. The Cop shouting the Instructions was NOT the one who shot him.  4. The Cop did NOT have a ""Military"" or ""Automatic"" Rifle, it was an AR-15  5. Many have said the cop should go to trial and be found guilty of murder. He ALREADY went to Trial and was Acquitted.   6. They said if they protest/make calls/etc that this Verdict can be Appealed or Overruled.  That is literally impossible and this is the reason Double Jeopardy Exists.  7. The Police were called because they received a call that there were guns in the room and that the suspect was waving them around and pointing at people, Apparently there was a Pellet Rifle.  8. The Victim was NOT shot while on the ground, he was on his knees.  9. The Officers may have not followed 100% correct protocol and maybe were intentionally being assholes, but the guy did reach for his waist band which is a HUGE No No.  10. Many said the police could have ""Easily Cuffed Him"", There is no way to know this for sure and apparently the guy was drunk and the officers believed he was armed, which technically he was.  I am not saying I disagree or Agree with what the Officers did, and IF they should have been convicted of murder, just pointing out some blatantly wrong stuff I saw on the Rest of Reddit.

"Its so fitting. I don't know how I didn't think if it sooner.  Our generations. GenX, GenY, GenZ/Me... we've always struggled to find a fitting Gen name for our current kids and teens.  But I have it!  Generation Derangement. Or 'Gender' for short.  But in seriousness the only way to fight back against the loony left is to use their words against them. They took 'sex' away from us and replaced it with 'gender' and its 73+ variations.  So lets start using 'Gender' against them. Generation Derangement.  And I'm thinking it needs to be said like ""Gen-Der"" with the break in there. Or even ""Gen Duuuuurrr"".  If you want people to stop doing something then make it unattractive to them.  Generation Duuuuurrr  I'm so rolling with this!"

"Previously brigaded post: r/The_Donald/comments/7iaq3r/dont_get_fooled_by_saudis_sudden_wake_up_call_for  Don't get fooled by Saudi's sudden wake up call for wanting to reform Islam. It will never happen, and this is why:  **Taqiyya** - it advises Muslims to lie and deceive kuffar (infidels aka non-believers) to advance the spread of Islam and conquest of the world. Sometimes you have to step backwards (retreat) to advance further ahead (in your conquest)  Never ever trust someone who's ideology says you are a filthy subhuman kuffar, and it's totally ok to lie to you to promote their religious agenda (turning the entire world into a Caliphate). Don't forget they are still using slave labor to build their extravagant cities in the desert. They treat their women as female properties. They jail and kill gays. They jail and kill women who have been raped. They marry young girls so they can legitimately rape them. If you smuggle somethings related to another religion, they will arrest, jail and eventually kill you. They have been using their petrodollars to promote Islam in the West (mainly Europe) and helped bribing corrupt politicians to build thousands of mosques around the world. Let's not make the same mistake as Eurabia. It's time to show them their ideology invented by a pedophile, misogynist, sex slave master, blood thirsty, schizophrenic warlord has no place in the modern world."

"As many as half of Mueller’s team have donated over one thousand dollars to Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. One investigator, Jeannie Rhee, not only donated $5,400 to Clinton’s 2016 campaign, but also provided her legal services to the Clinton Foundation, via The Hill.  Law360, New York (November 20, 2015, 10:14 PM EST) -- Hillary Clinton urged the Eleventh Circuit Friday to side with a Florida district court that kicked out a prolific litigant’s allegations that he was wrongly denied access to emails Clinton sent through her private account as secretary of state, on the grounds that he lacked standing.  Who was her lawyer on that case, defending the Clintons?  She was.  Clinton is represented by Jamie S. Gorelick and Jeannie S. Rhee of WilmerHale, David E. Kendall, Katherine M. Turner and Amy M. Saharia of Williams &amp; Connolly LLP and Jeffrey E. Marcus, Daniel L. Rashbaum and Michael A. Pineiro of Marcus Neiman &amp; Rashbaum LLP.  Jeannie S. Rhee was also the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, for first lady Hillary Clinton.  She also has two years of DOJ experience, serving as deputy assistant attorney general under former Attorney General Eric Holder. She advised Holder and Obama administration officials on criminal law issues, as well as criminal procedure and executive issues, according to her biography on WilmerHale's website.  As many critics of Mueller's investigation have pointed out, Rhee represented Hillary Clinton in a 2015 lawsuit that sought access to her private emails. She also represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 racketeering lawsuit.  If that isn't bias, what is.  Now you tell me how an Obama puppet, Hillary stooge, and someone who has worked for the Clintons for over a decade, can be ""impartial"".  Impossible.  "
I guarantee you if there's a way to do it the left has explored it cuz that's who they are.  I think this process needs to be reexamined.

For all the caterwauling about Russian hackers and shit, the FACT is, paid internet trolls hired by Media Matters literally do what they are trying to claim Russians did- they attempt to undermine and manipulate open debate to their ends.

I'd tell this bitch to get fucked, but I'd rather keep that topic off the table cause this bitch has the herpeghonnasypilaids. BIGTIME, bro.  All these -actual- racist assclowns and their anti-white rhetoric. They claim they are the solution to the problem of American racism while indulging in rank racism themselves. Likely, and besides the man being -in fact- the best man for the job after decades of economic malfeasance, coupled with the specter of a Crooked Hillary presidency, these idiots are why Trump got elected, but they only see other peoples racism(real, or usually in thair case, IMAGINED). They are the very definition of being tone deaf and blind to their own faults. And its all very much intentional, so they can get fucked with that shit.  The BLM- A very special note to these asshats. First of all, lets get this up front, alot of conservatives are libertarian or libertarian leaning. Alot of us would like to see substantial rectification of the justice system. We were as mortified by the militancy of the police and the nature of the surveillance state as anyone else. But guess what? Because you morons had to go provoking race riots and the cold blooded murder of police, now we think the police don't have ENOUGH shit to control your stupid asses and the terrorists your precious Blak Plastik Jeebus brought into our nation. And now you know why we told yo to go get fucked with your racist, anti-American, outright marxist bullshit. Again- get fucked BLM.   ISIS and other radical terrorists.

And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

"The Democrats are not suddenly developing consciences. These calls for Al Franken to resign, the resignation of John Conyers, the fall of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, throwing the Clintons under the bus, that's all for show. The fact that nobody is even hearing a peep about Bob Menendez is another indication. What is going on is the left is setting themselves up as the side that stands against the epidemic of sexual malfeasance in politics and big entertainment.  Which brings me to Roy Moore. Roy Moore has been found guilty of sexual misconduct and child molestation, not in a court of law, but in a court of public opinion, but he hasn't done what Republicans in his position are supposed to do, which is drop out of the race at the first sign of trouble. If he wins the senate election, which I suspect he probably will even though I'm worried about Alabama, then that's the opportunity the Democrats need to go to the next level of name-calling.  The new narrative will be as follows (and it will be the Democrats' strategy for 2018 and 2020): ""The Democrats cleaned house, and excommunicated the sexual abusers from their ranks, while the Republicans allowed a known serial sexual abuser to be elected to the Senate, with the approval of the President. We *told* you the Democrats are the good guys. It's time to take congress back from these rape apologists.""  That's how the Democrats plan to take back congress, and there are not enough people on here, or anywhere, talking about this."

"[Luke 2:21-38 NLT] Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived. Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.   The law of the Lord says, “If a woman’s first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the LORD.” So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord—“either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”   At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.   That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required, Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,    “Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace, as you have promised. I have seen your salvation, which you have prepared for all people. He is a light to reveal God to the nations, and he is the glory of your people Israel!”   Jesus’ parents were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby’s mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, but he will be a joy to many others. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him. As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul.”   Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years. Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer. She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem."

"This all seems very confusing to me why now this transition would take place.  After hearing Trump actually talk about it he mentioned the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995.    WTF?  I go and start reading about this and find that back in 1995 the proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93–5), and the House (374–37).  My feel is he is just doing what congress wanted back in 1995 and going through the motions to make it a reality.  They (congress) could have stopped this at any time but never did.  Now it's a big deal because he is actually following through.    What If this, among other things, is setting them all up for failure again and it will spotlight why our congress would want to make such a move in the first place showing the history (23 years) of how long congress has been a foothold."

"It is really very simple. Life got harder for most of us under Obama, very, very hard. In a year Trump has managed to reverse much of the damage Obama, the Democrats, and RINOS did.

I say "" you say all the time that President Trump is a racist, and a bigot and now you say he should go to jail, but when I ask you to provide proof you NEVER can, how come?"" He then says, ""well Trump is a liar"", and I say ""name one thing he lied about"", he then looks at another driver that just came into the room for to back him up, but that driver says to him ""I support President Trump as well.""

"How does every time someone tries to attack Trump it backfires twice as hard?   In this thread I'm going to expose a few theories containing all possible explanations.   * 1- Trump is a time traveler   Trump knows everything that is going to happen, that's how he gets an edge over his opponents.   * 2- Trump is a criminal mastermind.   Trump's intelligence is above our comprehension he can foresee and take actions against multiple of his enemies at the same time. He can hide collusion with foreign countries, rule a country, create a nazi army and still find time to shitpost on Twitter.   * 3- Trump is blessed by the power of KEK   KEK works in mysterious ways. The first president democratically elected by God. If KEK wills it, how can we be against it?   * 4- Trump is an extraterrestrial being.   With his ultra advanced telepathic powers, Trump can read his opponents and even force them to humiliate themselves.   * 5- Trump is a truthful man.   Trump isn't perfect, he's just a man. But he tries to be as truthful as possible to his principles and beliefs. Whenever someone tries to spread fake news the truth appears and Trump wins.      What's your opinion?"

"Because crimes are something that you can say are a breaking of the law by a person--something you know or suspect that a person did  But when you investigate a person, it's kind of like you don't really have a crime to pin on them, so you can investigate that person forever, or at least until you either find a crime, make up a crime, or cause that person to commit a crime in the process of investigation  I don't believe we investigate PERSONS, I believe in America we investigate CRIMES.    Unless of course, that person has no Constitutional rights; which menas that none of us have Constitutional rights, which begs the question: why don't we have Constitutional rights.

"The article is about how Republicans are attacking the legitimacy of the Mueller investigation because they are 'worried' (let me remind you that nothing substantial has come out of the investigation).  ""There’s a similar logic at work today. The public isn’t going to follow all the twists and turns of the Russia scandal and know the entire cast of characters; I’d be surprised if 20 percent of Americans could tell you who Michael Flynn is, let alone George Papadopoulos or Sergey Kislyak. But if they can be convinced that the whole thing is just partisan, then they don’t have to know. Republicans will follow their natural inclination to line up behind their party, insulating Trump and his administration from any kind of accountability.""   It is ironic because an uninformed leftist reading this will agree but have no idea who the hell Peter Strzok is or the fact that the Director of the FBI has confirmed this bias in his hearing. They don't know that it is a real issue being investigated by the DoJ. "

"Greetings everybody.    I've been browsing T_D for a while now.  It's really interesting to watch.  Here's my story:  I grew up in a middle class family.  I got a college education, graduating in 2007.  I'm still paying on the loans what I can so I can be out of debt.  ($500-$1k/month)  I've worked hard over the past 9 years to get where I am right now; I've worked smart and hard in my industry and it has allowed me to succeed.  I've never been a big follower of politics but the presidential campaigns and elections seemed to have forced it on me.  Now I'm here everyday.  I don't post anything really (this is my first), but I'm watching.  I am here because of my coworkers.  They are leftists, quite literal SJWs. (Organizing/attending events.  I earned the ire of some coworkers because I didn't attend the women's march. Trump bashing when they can fit it in.)  We were sitting down one day after work and they began saying that everyone who voted for Trump was a Nazi.  I told them that they shouldn't generalize like that.  Their claims kept getting reduced the more I pushed on them, however I brought up the point that doing this was the WORST way to try and win anyone to their side.  I don't really understand it. (Maybe this is going to turn into a rant.)  The people who are the most vocal seem to have the most problems in their own lives (aforementioned people come from well to do families, one with seven figure+ bank accounts, drinking problems, etc.)  I've found that it's easiest to try and fix someone else's problems before turning inward to look at one's self.  Taking responsibility for one's own actions is HUGE.  It's not fun, and definitely not the easiest, but it is right.  I did not vote for Trump.  I did not vote for the Libertarians.  I voted for Hillary.  I wasn't very excited about it either, but I hadn't really researched much and the media made Trump out to be an idiot.  The more I watch what he's doing, I'm glad he's there.  We'll see how this whole thing plays out.  I sometimes think that change, meaningful change, will not be comfortable.  Hell, I'm a recovering alchy and have had to do a lot of uncomfortable self-work to get where I am now.    So, there's probably a lot of people out there, like me, who are watching and reading with great interest.  I look at the Conservative/Libertarian boards too.  Here's to hoping Trump keeps kicking ass.    All the best.      "

The nephew of the King of Saudi Arabia, worth over $16 billion, owns much of CitiGroup and Twitter.  He and his faction pumped many millions over decades into American left politicians, media and non-governmental orgs like BLM (the Swamp), promoted extremism, radical Mosques and was one of **America's most damaging enemies.** See below.  Personally, he is a world class scumbag.  Dopey also gave mega millions to the CF and HRC including when she was Secretary of State and for her campaign. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) depends entirely on oil money, and the market tanked.  Dopey's faction wanted to build a [Pipeline](http://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/is-the-fight-over-a-gas-pipeline-fuelling-the-worlds-bloodiest-conflict/news-story/74efcba9554c10bd35e280b63a9afb74) to Europe which badly needs energy and can pay a lot.  But this pipeline would run thru Syria, and Syria said no (the Russians said no because they need Europe to be dependent on Russia's energy and really need the money.)  HRC set up 'freedom fighters' (who became ISIS, see Benghazi) to destroy Syria enough ('regime change') to run the pipeline.  When Hillary won in 2016, this plan would be completed.  Dopey [supported her](http://thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/anti-trump-saudi-prince-alwaleed-clinton-donor-jailed-corruption-crackdown/) as much as he could get away with (and probably a lot more.)

This Killshot made crystal clear to all Saudis that Dopey's (and all the 'bad' Saudis) methods/plans/actions would be a **catastrophic liability if Trump won**, and that **it was personal**.

Dopey's faction, in fact all of KSA, was thoroughly screwed:  Not only would Trump not send our military to die fighting Russia for the Pipeline, he would end all Saudi influence in our government and go after our enemies in the KSA with a vengeance, starting with 9-11:  An American jury can award punitive damages based on the defendants' net worth, jury awards would have resulted in the seizure of most KSA assets in the US. Military aide would have been curtailed.  Worse, [Obummer's worst deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7eym7x/the_art_of_the_deal_trump_is_using_the_worst_deal/) ever, the Iran deal, suddenly had KSA facing extinction:  Iran's fanatic mullahs would have nukes in ~10 years, and those would be aimed at [Israel and KSA](http://archive.is/Fv4VF), Iran's mortal enemies.

Welcome [non-muslims.](http://archive.is/l3XTN) [MBS new Crown Prince](http://archive.is/1T7PZ)  Trump's side of the deal:  [**Eradicating**](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7fj6ka/today_saudi_prince_mbs_forms_islamic_military/) [**terrorism**](http://archive.is/lEL9j), **ending influence** in America, **peace in the entire Middle East**, and an **end to the Iranian nuclear threat** and Iran's [sponsoring of terror](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7fcxrw/today_rex_tillerson_saudi_crown_prince_and_iraqi/).  All **without any US fighting** over there or us paying anything (actually the US is making a fortune in investments and arms sales soon).  In May, [Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/21/president-trumps-speech-arab-islamic-american-summit) and team went to KSA. The [sword dance](http://archive.is/yKQQd) the MSM laughed about was the Saudi tribe **getting ready for war**.  Trump and Rex participated as equals.  The **deal was completed**.  In June, the King made [MSB the new Crown Prince upending their 'rules'](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448834/saudi-arabias-king-names-son-crown-prince), and **MBS will be King** soon.  This also cut Dopey's faction completely out of the line of succession.  During this time, MBS was consolidating power quietly.  On Oct. 1, 2017 some believe Dopey saw where this was going and ordered [MBS killed](http://archive.is/O9mtk), but that's another [story-not my post.](https://imgur.com/a/DTeK7?t=777) Note: this URL ends in 777.  Nov. 4, 2017 - The Saudi [**Night of Long Knives**.](http://archive.is/Id2qr) Hundreds of the most powerful are arrested. Dopey's faction included the guy who was going to be King - that guy's son was killed that night, in a thoroughly documented ['accident.'](http://archive.is/5tjJ3)  Nov. 23, 2017 - It is confirmed that Dopey Prince is being [**hung upside down and beaten**](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/report-anti-trump-saudi-prince-alwaleed-hung-upside-beaten-interrogators-saudi-arabia/), along with others, with specialists brought in for the occasion.  Dec. 5, 2017. The Saudi prosecutor announced that most of the fat cats arrested have made ['settlements'](http://archive.is/JAtwU) that stripped them of power and much of their wealth (guesses run around 30-70%).  Btw, [120K+ lowlifes](http://archive.is/PE13v) were rounded up and tossed also within a few days.  They said Dopey was [offered a deal](http://archive.is/1G7lZ) where he gets a lifetime house arrest with no phones or contacts with the media (implied is that **he loses all assets**) but that Dopey turned down this merciful deal and demands a trial.  Dopey is charged with corruption, which is a big crime and also a big sin, carrying the **death penalty.**  Demanding a trial means going to prison until the trial.  His trial, since he is a Royal, is under House law, which means whatever the King wants, within customs.  tl;dr Dopey Prince is now ruined and facing death.  GEOTUS' single tweet destroyed him. ================== *More importantly, GEOTUS' Middle East Peace Plan is looking good ending our constant wars there, vastly decreasing terrorism and anti-Americanism here and abroad, minimizing the Iran threat,  and if MBS reveals Dopey's financial records to the world, showing payments to our Swamp, it could blow up our Swamp from the bottom.*  ^spez:typos"

"A Visit From St. T  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the House,  Not a creature was stirring, not even a Louse;  The Promises were hung by the chimney with care,  In hopes that GEOTUS soon would be there;  The snowflakes were nestled all snug in their beds,  While visions of ""Bernie's Back!"" danced in their heads,  And Lady Pede and I in our red MAGA caps,  Had just settled our brains from two long winter’s ""naps""-  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.  Away to the window I flew like a flash  Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash.  The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,  Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below;  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,  But monster choppers with the Man in the rear  With his proud grin, so lively and quick  I knew in a moment it must be God's Pick  More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  And he signaled, and shouted, and called them by name:  ""Now Gowdy! Now Nunes! Now Grassley and Rand Paul,  On Matthis! On Big Rex! On Pence, Barron and all,  ""To the height of fortune! To celebrate the Wall!  ""Now Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock away all!""  As reee-reees before the wild hurricane fly,  When they meet with Reality, triggered so high  So up over the blue states the scourges they flew  With Apaches full of red pills dropped by Melania too.  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof  The roasting and laughing at each CNN goof  My sides splitting as I was rolling around  Down the chimney GEOTUS came with a bound:  He was dressed all in glory, from his head to his foot,  And his clothes were so fine, even better than Newt;  A bundle of XOs hung on his back,  And he looked like a savior just opening his pack:  His eyes - how they twinkled! his dimples how merry,  His brows were friendly, his smile so very;  His witty mouth was ready, drawn like a bow,  And the hair on his head was as ready to go;  A .45 cartridge he held tight in his teeth,  And the smoke encircled his head like a wreath.  ★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��★ ��  He had a great face, much better than telly  That shook when he laughed, like napalm jelly:  He was strong and tall, a Biblical self,  And I roared when I saw him in spite of myself;  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  And fulfilled all the Promises; then turned with a jerk,  And laying his finger aside of his nose  And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.  He sprung to his Long Bow, to his team gave a whistle,  And away they all flew, like a launch of Cruz missiles.  But I heard him exclaim, ere he flew out of sight-  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! ------------------------"

"Pope Pius X is one of the greatest men that history has had the pleasure to produce.  He held the modernists in stark disdain.

He was the North Star that people of faith grasped to, to save them from the precipice.  The Pope that stomped on those trying to bring degeneracy to the House of Christ.  This Lion of the Papacy was not a docile pet, but this lion let roar to be heard.  He removed the modernists in the midst of the flood.  The modernists might take from us our churches, our mass, our sacraments, everything we hold dear. They cannot take from us our God. Nor can they take from us this lion that roared from the thrones at the enemy of the Church.  He wasn't afraid to brawl with the communists in the streets.

"Did anyone else think the political SJW shit crept wayyyyyyy too far into the movie?   First off, who the fuck was captain Holdo? The ONLY human in Star Wars to have SJW fucking hair, happens to be a woman, and leads ""the resistance."" That sure is a coincidence. Then she just happens to be a total dumb cunt and the WORST admiral ever. If she kept her chain of command informed most of the movie wouldn't have happened with Finn/ Rose etc.  Next, who the fuck was this Rose bitch? Some snowflake diversity hire to make the movie feel more inclusive? YOU GUYS ARE FIGHTING AN ALL OUT WAR WITH A MASSIVE MILITARIZED REGIMENTED FORCE, and then this bitch decides to kill my ""death with honor for Finn"" boner and hit his ship before he allahu akbars the enemy cannon. And she does it all in the name of love. WHAT THE FUCK. Had Luke not been there to help, the resistance would've been doomed. Not to mention their whole little ""save the animals, rich people finance wars and therefore suck"" narrative.

Not to mention his attitude is basically that of a pissed off little ANTIFA goon the whole way.

Idk man, this movie sucked a lot of balls to me and just so happened to bring some SJW stuff with it. "

"The Trump Curse is not a magical karmic retribution. Horrible people with shitty pasts and skeletons in their closet are for some reason especially triggered by Trump, and their inability to keep their mouths shut is just indicative of a lifetime of retardation.

Sometimes it's a coincidence though, like with John Mayer. So when you hear someone attacking the God Emperor, you know they have problems, and it's only a matter of time before those problems come down upon them."

Unfortunately, many of them have been banned for being ""alt-right"" by weak willed pansies more worried about optics than saving our country.  These groups were the last line of defense against tyranny, because as long as we refuse to fight back, until the left have to worry about their tactics getting them killed, they will not stop.  The fear of an armed and well-regulated populace is what stops the left, not facts and logic they can easily laugh off and ignore while a deaf populace scrolls down to the next headline.

"Here we go pedes! Time to shove it right down the throats of the left and GOPe. Bama pedes, the spotlight is on you deplorable, lovable fuckers! Just a reminder, Moore has 9 ""accusers""....only problem is, 7 of them either were simply asked out on a date or actually on their own volition dated him. Doesn't sound like sexual assault to you does it? Certainly doesn't to me! Oh and we'd be remiss without mentioning Ms. Beverly ""oops, just fyi I forgot to tell you I 'added' to my yearbook"" Young who after a MONTH of nonstop agitation by the media admitted the blue/black ink discrepancy was what we assumed all along. But hey, we're all a bunch of racist, sexist cousin-fuckers who are too stupid to know what to do with the car we're chasing if we caught it. Below here's a guide to fending off lefty shills today. We're gonna need it. Every hand on deck. Nov. 8th last year, Dec 12th this year. Let's Maga!  The only sources I used for information on the nine accusers was Time magazine and QZ (Quartz media) which has been rated as right down the middle but employs people from The Atlantic and The WSJ, the atlantic of course being the far more egregious of the two. Here's a summation of the nine accusers using their own data:  * One was in high school, he asked her for a date at the mall. She said no.....that's it. OK down to 8 accusers.  * Two was above the age of consent when she stated BY HER OWN ADMISSION they dated off and on for several months and her mom knew and approved of him, going so far to say that he's marriage material because he's an already established assistant DA. That's all for her. Down to 7 accusers.  * Three, the big one who hired Allred, alleges actual sexual misconduct...but has no proof. She and Gloria instead trot out a yearbook he happened to sign as incontrovertible proof he sexually assaulted her and in a way you and I would actually consider sexual assault. When Moore goes ""that's horseshit, lets have a handwriting expert take a look"" Allred refuses and it's been two weeks. That's the entire summation of the evidence she has. She stated he groped her, pushed her head towards her crotch (both heresay and inadmissible) and signed a yearbook, the only piece of admissible evidence, which her lawyer refuses to let an impartial party examine. Additionally, her own son calls her take on it complete nonsense and Roy Moore preceded over her divorce hearings during which at no point did she ask for a change of venue due to her and Roy's previous encounter. So she WON'T tell her attorney back then to ask for a change of venue (and as you know, he could make up any number of reasons including ""it's a small town and we'd like to go somewhere where the judge may not consciously or subconsciously have a bias towards one of the parties"") but she WILL tell a Washington Post reporter just all willy nilly? And how did that reporter find her and the other women? ""While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls."" Interesting, so they were actively digging for dirt then? She stated she told her sister what had happened two years after the alleged incident, told her husband before they got married and also told her mother about four years ago. The only response any of those three have given to corroborate is her sister ""recalling a conversation"" but not verifying the content of that discussion nor the validity of the content she was told. Per Allred, ""Nelson's younger sister is unlikely to give a public statement regarding the allegations"". Down to 6 accusers. This one is Beverly Young Nelson. EDIT SINCE THE YEARBOOK IS FOUND FALSE!  * Fourth: by her own admission, 18 and said they dated off and on 'and he gave me booze' which he denied. She also stated they did nothing besides kiss. Boy, looks to me like he's a dude in his early 30's who likes dating barely legal girls but respects the hell out of boundaries. Down to 5 accusers.  * 5th was TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. Wait, I thought he was a pedophile? So he likes super young girls or he doesn't, I'm confused. She was visiting his law office with her mother, though to sign over custody of her 12 year old son to her mother since she was going through a divorce. Interesting. Typically when divorces happen, don't one parent or the other or both get custody? Must have been a real serious, contentious and unsafe divorce if a child is not only being given to the grandparent but already living with them. But as for the allegations, 'he got so close to me I could smell his breath and when my mother left he grabbed my butt'. Ooh, way to paint a picture, you could smell his breath and you remember what color dress you were wearing? Well if that doesn't prove your story is true I'm not sure what will! Down to 4 accusers.  * 6th, at the age of 22 said he repeatedly asked her out at the mall and she said no. Nothing else. At all. Seems to me that, even if true, is nothing more than harassment, certainly not an allegation worth even discussing. Down to three.  * 7th, said she was asked out by Moore multiple times working at that mall when she was 16, and before that their only interaction was when she was 14 working at the mall as Santa's Helper and he told her she was pretty. Boy, interesting to remember a single interaction from 14 that lasted probably under 10 seconds. Her mom told her she was not allowed to go out with him even though she states ""I was flattered at the time"". As for her mom? Dead. Unable to verify any veracity of the claim. No actual contact. Down to 2.  * Eight: girl was working at a Red Lobster as a hostess at 17 and said he came in and asked her out. She said no as she was in a relationship, and asked if he knew how old she was. He said ""yes I go out with girls your age all the time"". End of that story! Nothing happened, no contact, yet again another turned down date equals accusation of sexual misconduct.  * 9th is the only other one that would be sexual assault by a reasonable definition. Leigh Corfman said at 14 he asked for her number, which she gave to him and a few days later he drove to her house and kissed her. On a second visit he made her grab his dick over his underwear. She asked him to drive her home which he did, meaning he stopped at a dry half a handjob through his underwear if true. There was no additional contact. Moore says he has no idea who she is and no evidence presented by anyone shows otherwise.  THAT'S IT. So let's sum up. Nine total accusers, ~~two~~ one actually meet criteria for sexual assault if true, though one presents no evidence whatsoever and a ~~2nd presents solely a yearbook as physical proof while having previously been charged with fraud I believe and found guilty of a lesser crime based on a plea bargain. Hard to find when I googled it, shocking I know. Allred also admitted she ""hadn't asked"" Nelson if she had actually seen Moore physically sign her yearbook in person~~. The other 7? One was a butt grope, with no way to prove it, four were turned down dates WITH NO PHYSICAL CONTACT BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION and two were openly dating after being past the age of consent. So.....what's the issue? Why are there ""nine accusers""? Hell, if every girl I asked on a date and said no then ""accused me of sexual impropriety"" the list would be a mile long. How about multiple one night stands based off online dating where both of us were drinking? Those in play? It's beyond absurd. I'll grant that those ~~two~~ one accusation needs to be taken with sincerity and seriousness but Allred is bound and determined to obstruct any third party from looking at any evidence. They blew their load too early, if they were going to file a civil or criminal complaint they needed to have done it by now. After all you have nine accusers right?! Oh wait there's not an argument any court in the land would accept for six of them and the 7th wouldn't be able to win so much as a civil claim based on the preponderance of the evidence because a butt grab not even seen by her dead mother won't hold any water."

The people are their greatest fear,	   the largest army anywhere.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Invaded by dead men of greed, 	   humanity kept in the caves.	   paradise eclipsed by hell,	   counterfeiting dollar chains.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   The mercenary scum of Earth	   is now in their employ,	   they'd kill The Virgin giving birth	   and rape the choirboys.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Depicting grand realities,	   the matrix lie of nanny state, 	   while stacking coffins near the cities 	   to seal our stink and mortal fate.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Northwood, Paperclip, Nine Eleven,	   ten cancer cures and Building Seven,	   nazi clans, cults, and cartels,	   ushers to extinction hell.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Our children dumbed and poisoned.	   All markets rigged and raked.	   50 trillion stolen.	   Official numbers faked.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Politics is business.	   War 's a profit deal,	   harvesting both nations,	   wasting lives they steal.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   They pulled the New York towers down, 	   looted 50 trillion;	   they murder with fake medicine, 	   targeting the billions. 	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Operation Northwood,	   a plan to shoot down planes	   full of US passengers,	   then Cuba would be framed.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   The joint chiefs all approved this shit,	   this false flag set to go,	   had passengers in cross-hair sights..	   said JFK, “Hell fucking no!”	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Nine-one-one a show for fools,	   three thousand people trapped and ground.	   Explosives sent by global ghouls.	   Steel buildings don't burn down!	  &amp;nbsp; 	   They don't deny 'Building 7' was pulled;	   since it wasn't hit by a plane.	   But can't lay charges in just hours,	   would take them at least days.	  &amp;nbsp; 	   Which means the twins were wired as well	   to blow this broadway show;	   so swallow this New York red pill	   to understand, then know.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   If crude fires could melt metal,	   no bellows could be found,	   granny's fire stove would be	   a puddle on the ground.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   If kerosene burns steel frames,	   why pay demolition fees,	   been a hundred years of flames, 	   not one blew up like these.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   One in Spain burned for two days,	   torch lit a hundred miles away;	   afterwards all steel remained,	   while on its roof a heavy crane.	  &amp;nbsp; 	   All the laws of physics say 	   three towers were demolished,	   exothermic nano thermite	   detonation sequence polished.	  &amp;nbsp; 	   They set out to destroy all three,	   the planes.. a decoy reason,	   so when the three came crashing down	   no one would suspect treason.	   &amp;nbsp; 	   Building 7 set to blow,	   when wrapped in pyroclastic smoke,	   but building 6 got in the way,  	   detonating stooges choked.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Seven was a problem now,	   explosives laid and wired to go,	   video cameras everywhere	   and no reason to explode.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Bomb sniffing dogs circle	   a patient demolition team,	   but if they wait til dark	   explosive flashes will be seen.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Finally they just pulled it,	   with 50 cameras, broad daylight,	   more proof of government at work	   since they could not do it right.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   cheney took em down with help,	   but he's just a flunky stooge,	   when Toto pulls the curtain back,	   you'll see sick global ghouls.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   They killed three thousand people,	   and anyone can prove this,	   by looking at the evidence,	   but of course you've never seen it.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   When truth of 911 gets round,	   deep state inside corrupt.	   Three towers were not falling down,	   but clearly blowing up.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Fingerprint trace element,	   nano thermite slag in pours,	   molten pools of melted steel,	   exothermic signatures.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Free fall collapse of structured steel,	   pancake impossible unreal,	   breaks all of Newton's basic laws,	   one lie with fifty thousand flaws.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Norad told to “Stand full down,	   ignore twin tower calls for help.

They shredded Constitution more,	   rights lost beyond all measure.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Wars aren't fought for people,	   not for sisters, dads or mothers,	   they're planned in cold blood greed filled rooms	   by Cains who murder brothers.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Not for country, not for God,	   not for the girl next door,	   but for a few blood drinking sods,	   hellborn global overlords.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   They set us up, don't care who wins,	   inside both sides they play,	   when streets run red with mingled blood 	   they clean up either way.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   Nine eleven, JFK, area 51, 	   nanny state, reprobates,	   who really lost and won,	   the big world wars, 	   the great moon race, 	   famous Holly-whores	   how far we've been out in space, 	   cults, cartels, and more..	    &amp;nbsp; 	   The truth far out of common reach,	   eclipsed by MSMatrix,	   blinding people everywhere	   with poisoned: food, meds, water, air.	    &amp;nbsp; 	   While purchased 4th estate portrays	   Fairy poppins, happy days, 	   but when mary's face unzippers	   you find out she's jack the ripper.

Bill Clinton is a rapist!
AND I FUCKING LOVE IT!  MAGA!!  MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
"The most dumb thing I read on T_D is ""Thank God we won 2016 or we would never have another one!"" or its alternative ""We must give everything on the next whatever election and support even shitty candidates because we cannot lose or the country goes down"". Sorry, these posters and their upvoters looked like idiots to me.  Then I realized my ""invisible knapsack"": I lived through the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. I've seen lefty globalists fall despite having literal tanks on the streets and literal secret police taking away people to literal camps. Compared to them, Strzok is a schoolboy playing James Bond. And they still lost.  It is true that globalists can already control what the normies see on TV. It is true that they could create false charges against the *President* to get rid of him. They could remove practically all conservative ideas from the social media where normies could see it.  It's also true that with Hillary and some executive overreach they could control what even right-wingers see, [controlling the ISPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7hcolp/disturbing_redpill_the_day_obama_nationalized_the/). They can and will do awful lot of oppressive things to silence dissent, to force people to newspeak, calling even rape as cultural enrichment.  **But they can't do one thing: feed the people.** Maduro and Kim Jong Un could create extremely oppressive regimes, but they cannot conjure up food from nothing. Only free people can create GDP. The Soviet Block didn't lose any war. Even at their end days they had their mutually assured destruction ability. The Soviet Block didn't have any meaningful revolts and the oppression still worked. But the people were impoverished and every year they were more and more behind the West. Then came this Gorbachev guy and said ""it's not OK to starve"" and gave up on Communism. If the hardliners could defeat him, the Communist block might linger on for some years, but sooner or later some leader would have given up on it. The Chinese - while upkeeping party political control - embraced capitalism and with it several individual rights. One day a leader will come in North Korea, look around and will say ""this is fucked up"". It's only the matter of time.  Liberal globalists can silence everyone who doesn't say ""diversity is our strength"" but they can't make the ""diverse"" companies function, just like Mugabe couldn't make the farms function after he took them from the white farmers and gave them to illiterate blacks. They can silence everyone who say ""migrants are raping women on the streets"" but they can't make these streets have functioning shops and businesses as women are now hiding in their homes, not working, not buying. They can divert your tax to an education that teaches feminist dance therapy, but they can't produce anything with people who majored in feminist dance therapy.  Look at the D controlled cities: they are impoverished hellholes with Third World crime. They are not starving only because they can grab your taxes and give them to their voters. But if they controlled the whole country, there would be no one to tax.  Every time they win something, people will live worse than 4 years ago. Every time you win something, people live better than 4 years ago. They will notice the pattern. At least when they can no longer eat. The lefties can win battles, but at the end they will lose, simply because more and more people - including more and more liberals - will say ""fuck the ideas, I want to eat"". But it won't go that far. Don't you think the 4% GDP growth will redpill most businessmen who will donate in 2020 to keep it?  Sure, this doesn't rule out that the USA first turn into a ""liberal Venezuela"" before it gives up on liberalism. But luckily you have the second amendment that make Venezuela-level of poverty impossible to sustain. Also, Sweden and Germany did you the favor of drinking the globalist Kool-Aid all up, serving as an obvious warning to even moderate liberals. Not yet, but in a few years they will be failed states with Libyan standards. Then some ""warlord"" will rise and fix them.  So don't worry. 20 years from now you won't have illegals, you won't have diversity hiring, nor affirmative action, transgender children, mansplaning, white privilege, gender studies classes, BLM... It is true that how well you make politics will decide how fast you reach this and how bad it gets before it gets better. But you don't have to make desperate moves, don't have to vote for bad candidates just to prevent an even worse, you can say ""If both of them want open borders, I write in Big Beautiful Wall"" and get a candidate who runs on that 4/6 years later."

"Tomorrow you must go to the polls and vote. The leftists are mobilizing the liberal voters in the cities and are bringing in voters across state lines. Millions of dollars are pouring  in from outside interest groups in order to mobilize the liberal voters.  Forget the opinion polls. We all know that most conservatives do not participate in these fake polls. Don't get tired now. Put down the leaf rake, get off your butt, don't make any excuses. Call your neighbors and family to offer them or ask them for a ride to the voting booth. Try to convince everyone you know to vote.  You can only win if you go vote. So win and keep winning until you are tired of winning. Please go vote and help MAGA. Thank you."

In 2018 are all 435 House seats up for election? Meaning no one is guaranteed their spot back (unless running unopposed)  What about senate? Aren't those usually in Nov every 2 years as well? but are they also all up for election or just some?   I know Alabama was weird time because they had to replace sessions

The real cost of european immigrant crime is not the people who are murdered. Its the 100% of the rest of the people who now can no longer walk the streets in calm peace without fear. As long as migrants remain no one will ever again walk a  London sidewalk without a quickstep looking over their shoulder.

"When I bring up the fact that Bernie was controlled opposition, had an agreement with the Clinton campaign, or works for George Soros' pathetic SJW groups, I get buried on the rest of Reddit because people think it's not true. I just want people to take a look and see for yourself. I hope that people will wake up and stop letting this puppet fool you. I have attached his voting record, donations, and wikileaks emails showing he was in an agreement with the Clinton campaign. ***Let's rub it in the rest of Reddit's face that their favorite hero is a paid shill.***  moveon.org donations ___ Bernie is funded by a man who goes by the name of George Soros. No conspiracy here it's just hypocritical to take donations from a man who is part of the tip top 1%. And now it has come to our knowledge that he will vote for Hilary Clinton, someone he supposedly fundamentally disagrees with. ___ NDAA: Bernie Sanders: YES, Appropriates $80.71 billion for overseas contingency operations for fiscal year 2014 (Secs. 4102, 4202, 4302, 4402 &amp; 4502). As well as removing due process giving the government total control over who gets due process &amp; who doesn't. It permits the military to detain individuals indefinitely without trial. Bernie sanders voted yes on this, not to mention the increase in defense spending?Source: https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311 ___ Cyber Security Act: Bernie Sanders: YES, this bill is very simple to understand, tt literally destroys net neutrality. Generally speaking, net neutrality means that an Internet service provider such as cable or phone company treats all content equally. For example, it doesn’t offer faster transmissions for Netflix videos than it does for those from Amazon Prime. Bernie sanders voted yes to passing this bill.... Had that been passed internet would have been utterly destroyed as we know it.Source: https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41957S ___ Amdt 2372: Bernie Sanders:NO, This bill is simple to understand why it is needed. It Prohibits the EPA from spying on farmers. And it adds better regulation to school meal programs &amp; provides better healthier food for the kids. It also provides better regulation on what chemicals are put in our food. Bernie sanders voted no on this decent bill. Source: https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/40805 ___ USA FREEDOM Act: Bernie Sanders: YES, this bill is also very simple to understand, it extends the patriot act (implemented by bush), The patriot act is a bill that expands federal law enforcement power. It erodes our freedoms by, allowing the government to watch &amp; monitor our phone calls, emails, texts, etc. Basically eliminating the right to privacy in your own home. The fact this bill extends the patriot act is horrible &amp; Bernie Sanders voted for it. Source: https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/50592S ___ Amdt 139: Bernie Sanders: NO, this bill again is simple to understand. This bill prevents the UNITED NATIONS from taking away our fire arms. It basically strips the UNITED NATIONS of any law enforcement in America period. Source: https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/43297S ___ Amdt 1491: Bernie Sanders: NO, again this bill is very simple to understand as well. It extends the STOCK Act to ensure that the reporting requirements set forth in the STOCK Act apply to the executive branch and independent agencies. It prevents companies from evading taxes.

I served as a support person for a dozen or so Vermonters who sat-in in his Burlington office a couple weeks into that war. Not only did Sanders refuse to talk with us via telephone (unlike his Vermont counterparts in the Senate-Leahy and Jeffords), he had his staff call the local police to arrest those who refused to leave until Sanders spoke with them. The following week Sanders held a town hall meeting in Montpelier, VT., where he surrounded himself with sympathetic war supporters and one university professor who opposed the war and Bernie's support for it. During the question and answer part of the meeting, Sanders yelled at two of the audience's most vocal opponents to his position and told them to leave if they didn't like what he had to say. ___ In 2001, Bernie supported HR 1954, which extended the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. ___ Following the 9/11 attacks, Bernie voted in favor of H J Res 64 - Authorization for Use of Military Force, which allowed President Bush to use the United States Armed Forces against anyone involved with 9/11 and any nation that harbors these individuals. ___ In 2002, Bernie voted against H J Res 114, which authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq. However, he would continue to support bloated military defense bills that would ultimately be used to sustain the war he allegedly disagreed with. ___ In 2003, Bernie supported HR 5010, which provided $355.1 billion in appropriations for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2003 - an increase of $37.5 billion from 2002 - as well as: $71.6 billion for procurement of aircraft, missiles, weapons, combat vehicles and shipbuilding; $7.4 billion for ballistic missile defense; and $58.4 million for foreign aid, which includes humanitarian assistance, foreign disaster relief and de-mining programs. ___ He also voted in favor of HR 2800 - Foreign Operations Appropriations, FY 2004 bill, which granted $1.8 billion in military and economic assistance to Egypt and $2.2 billion for Israeli military assistance. ___ In 2004, Bernie supported HR 4613, which allocated $25 billion for emergency defense spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and $77.4 billion for the procurement of new weapons. ___ In 2005, Sanders supported HR 2863 - Defense Department FY2006 Appropriations Bill, which provided $50 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. ___ In 2006, Bernie voted for HR 5631, which provided $70 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. ___ In 2007, he supported HR 1585 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which granted $187.14 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan operations. ___ In 2009, he voted in favor of HR 2647, which authorized $309 million for research and evaluation, procurement, or deployment of an alternative Missile Defense System in Europe, and also allowed the Secretary of Defense to increase the active-duty number for the US Army to a number greater than otherwise allowed by law up to the 2010 baseline plus 30,000 troops. During the same year, he called closing the torturous gulag at Guantanamo a ""complicated issue"" and ultimately rejected a proposal to shut it down. ___ In 2011, Bernie co-sponsored S. Res. 85, which urged the UN Security Council to take action to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory. ___ In 2014, Bernie came out in favor of levying economic sanctions (an act of war) against Russia: ""The entire world has got to stand up to Putin,"" he said. ""We've got to deal with sanctions.""That same year, Bernie didn't object to having his name included - by unanimous consent - in S.498, which backed Israel's brutal, summer-long military assault against Gaza.Most recently, he vowed to continue Obama's murderous international drone war. ___ Bernie also supports funneling weapons into Iraq to fight ISIS as well as airstrikes, and he continues to spread the myth that Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons. ___ All of this information is publicly available and verifiable with a Google search. But hes for the people right? Bernie Sanders has a terrible voting record that tramples on the constitution and wastes billions of dollars. Sanders is proof that if you speak with a gravely, authoritative voice and tell people what they want to hear, you can gain national attention. Only once every several decades does someone come along who is so cunning, manipulative and masterful at combining nationalism, authoritarianism, propaganda and hatred into one slick campaign. Not sure what is more amazing, how brilliantly he is executing this strategy while working to appear folky or how many people are falling for it. It's really stunning. Please Bernie is not the savior you are looking for. Read some books about high level manipulation techniques and carefully analyze the lack of substance in what he says.﻿ ___  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47397  Bernie had an agreement with the Clinton campaign from the start. They had leverage on him from the start. He wasn't even allowed to run until he made this agreement. He has ALWAYS been controlled opposition that answers to his masters."
"The same professor was also sure to thoroughly mock Constantine's conversion to Christianity, insinuating that it was a farce. He also mentioned that Christianity didn't spread through faith, but through women because ""women are the main carriers of religion and men convert to women's religions"".   I'm not doubting that women played a large role in Christianity. But to say women are THE (not one of the) main carriers of religion, in all of history, seems pretty crazy. But alas, in a new series by the BBC the Greek Achilles will be played by an actor of Sub-Saharan African descent, so what do I know about history? "

"One of my favorite things about President Trump is his stance/commitment to American Manufacturing. This is something very important to me. Lately, I have been buying everything I can made in USA. I would encourage every one to think of doing the same. For example, I am now strictly buying made in USA clothing (shirts, jeans, jackets, shoes, everything). I have done lots of research and purchasing of clothing that you might think would be hard to find Made in USA, or would be super expensive, but with time I have found many companies that offer reasonably priced and very good quality made in USA. If anyone wants any suggestions for certain things or companies, I would be glad to offer my experience and suggestions. Thanks for your time. "

"**1. Lip Service**   They are hypocrites.  They have a [Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) that they neither abide nor protect, in *any* of their member countries.  It's hollow lip-service to an idea that will never be achieved, because there has been no effort to achieve it.  They've also not responded to inquiries about how the DoHR has contradicted the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances  The DoHR would be great to have, if it were implemented.  Again, it's a work of ficiton and always will be, because the UN basically is bullsh_t and they know it.  You don't see the UN for example, stepping in or stepping forward and sanctioning Facebook, twitter, youtube, reddit for censorship of the right wing voices.  That's one small example  --- **2. ""Drug War"" is A Failure. Because it's a Fake.  And UN started it**   [The 1971 (and ongoing) Convention(s) on Psychotropic Substances.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances)  This document has created the war on drugs.  It's created ratlines and the blackmarket for drugs.  We committed ourselves to it because we created it.  We can't get out of it without making other countries and ourselves look stupid.  Also, it means we can't federally legalize cannabis for example, until we get rid of this document (or alter it / amend it), because of our commitments *to* it.  Were this document not in play, countries would have been able to manage the illicit substances themselves and at their own sovereign discretion, without having to adopt a somewhat uniform USA, created, 'CIA'-oriented (DEA) substance schedule outline to ensure fair play in the world theater (ie: not causing problems for other countries).  This is a document that would place Cannabis into schedule I, wrongfully. They knew at 1971 when it was drafted that Cannabis had medical value; and there was no reason at all to place magic mushrooms on the schedule other than a political association with LSD, even though both are hallucinogenic, the effects are as different as coffee is to valium, and these were never abused, and even considered 'least harmful of all drugs' by the World Health Organization report on Illegal drug harm.  We know that much of the black propaganda about 'jumping out of windows' was urban myths created by the very same group that initially started the psychedelic counterculture (MKULTRA/CIA).    If we were to decriminalize drugs, people would begin to see police as doing their actual job, protecting and serving the people (rather than protecting and serving the corporate interests or protecting and serving the government itself).    Portugal is a test case where they did this over a decade ago, and lo and behold, crime went down, drug use stayed exactly the same, people are happy and society is stable.  If you can sell alcohol.  And if you can sell tobacco.  And you can sell mind-altering psychotropics with prescrptions that promise to make people happy but don't.  And you can sell diazepams and downers and mind-destroying anxiolytics, then really the idea of 'illegal substances' on the offset is just a mere politicization of substances.  The approval of which and taboo-forming of which is capricious, possibly religious, and ultimately arbitrary; and whose illegalization is only used as means to divide society into political substance-use based tribes, as a form of limiting relative power; ulitmately these decisions are used to control society through division and hegelian dialectics.  And what this means is there are blackmarkets that only enrich the intelligence agencies of member countries, as well as wall st, the plutocratic collectivist oligarchs that run CRIME INC, the new silk road, gangsters such as Hillary Clinton and her Podestinate millieu, to run a drugs-for-arms (iran contra / awan contra) con game which has only been used to continue this psychopathic control grid that would obligate taxpayers to fund--on the one hand--the spraying of Monsanto roundup-like herbicidal products on Latin American poppy fields (causing nearby innocents to have health issues btw), while simultaneously and on the other hand, using the US Marines to guard poppy farms in Afghanistan!    Then, after mutating the raw source into a high value product like fentanyl or medical drugs, ferrying these back to America in exchange for arms in that country, via both limited-hangout Muslim extremist groups we created (Al-CIADA // CIASIS // TaliCIAban) into our ports, as well as the Coast Guard and Navy--perhaps unknowingly--through the low or unvetted, unchecked, facile movement of EB-5 or TWIC recipients through low security merchant marines and/or the zeroday loophole of chain-migration immigration process; and then manage that drug raline by way of policy created by none other than the US President (Obama) himself  &lt;&lt; PROJECT CASSANDRA &gt;&gt;, with drugs funneled in, being distributed through gangs &lt;&lt;MS-13, Somalis &gt;&gt; managed by the FBI and CIA (JTTF) through Pakistani spies &lt;&lt;AWANS&gt;&gt; with 30+ businesses of all sorts throughout the united states, with demographic interfaces to many different institutional concerns &lt;&lt;AWAN PHARMA&gt;&gt;.  This situation is absurd.  And not an 'emergent system of failure' either: I'm saying it takes a LOT of very smart people to exploit America with drug ratlines in this way, while simultaneously fooling them with a complete fictional counternarrative sold on television as a 'difficult cultural war we are always on the verge of winning'!  To fix this situation, you basically you decriminalize (NOT LEGALIZE) drugs; then you legalize a few drugs that are really not harmful like they are purported to be: Cannabis, Mushrooms.  Possibly LSD for psychotherapy.  You legalize the least harmful and that will destroy the opiate ratlines.  Because Cannabis and mushrooms first of all, treat opiate addiction&gt; That's a fact.  Ketamine also, but it's not schedule 1 and it's already being used to treat opiate addiction.  50% success.  Which is YUUUGE.  That's a coin flip.  Doesn't work?  Try again. Try again. You're guaranteed to kick it at 50% success rate.  Guaranteed.  You won't hear about this much though in the news  Why?  Because the news is run by the same unipolar world / collectivist plutarch oligarchs that want to maintain the opiate biz.  They'd rather see you addicted so that they can also make money with the NARCAN / naloxone OD medication at 1000+ a pop, that they will sell to every police, firefighter, teacher, educator, nurse, EMT, postal worker, etc that they can.  Why?  Because Clinton Foundation has an exclusive deal with the pharma company that's trying to push Naloxone out to all these workers.    They don't want to end the drug war.  They want to maintain it forever.  Fentanyl was introduced to terrify all of society, but especially the good people among the police, the EMTs, the educators--the best among us who aren't corrupt--into carrying around NARCAN.  Sorry if that's too conspiratorial for you, but you MUST know by now, whom you're dealing with in Hillary Clinton, CIA, and her millieu.   --- **3. Kid Rape and Human Trafficking**  The UN has been caught in Syria, in Kosovo, and in Haiti trafficking children (Libya soon).  They just can't help themselves but to go to wartorn countries under the guise of providing logistics, humanitarian / medical aid for those affected in those area, when they themselves have created the very policies that create that war in the first place (ie: ratlines, see above--drugs for arms, arms for drugs). They just can't help themselves to bodysnatch the prettiest looking preteen and teen children to sell them as a rapetoy to an emirate in the UAE or Saudi prince.  They can't help but to separate out the prettiest women and spirit them off to be sold in human auction houses for the ultra rich  --- **4. Savings**   Finally, the reason President Trump has given: savings  &gt; ""Let them vote against us, we'll save a lot""  It's very simple. We'll save a lot by not giving to these worthless assclowns who have done nothing to help us in our disasters on our soil.  I guess they think we're all powerful and don't need their help.  Maybe we've trained them into thinking that's the case.  Maybe we're too proud to ask for help.  Whatever the reason, I just don't ever see like INTERPOL intervening where there is obviously a constitutional / Criminal crisis here.  I don't see international intelligence agencies coming to our rescue over Hillary Clintons obvious coup attempt  Maybe they are.  George Webb suggests there are some helping.  I just would expect more.  But perhaps they are all compromised by the CIA / Hydra also (the inslaw octo; the 7th floor group; the US shadow government; the collectivist globalist oligarchs, etc).    And that's all the more reason to defund the UN."

"As a boy, I remember so many Christmases where my father would tell me how good we had it. My grandmother would echo that. Christmas for them was whatever pocket change she could squirrel away all year when my grandfather gave her money for groceries. Both of them would tell me that usually, they would get assorted nuts to crack open and eat, and an apple. ""You always knew it had been a good year if you got an orange"" he'd say and my grandmother's eyes would light up. I thought to myself, 'my family is crazy' as I tried to figure out how to put the batteries in my new G.I. Joe jet figher. Growing up, we didn't have stockings, not really sure why but when I got married, my wife was passionate about them as a tradition. I made only one request: ""I dont care what you put in it, it's fine - just put an orange in the bottom of my stocking every year.  I sit here this morning with my orange, and am comforted by it's assurance that 2017 was a good year.  EDIT: I come home after a day visiting family and am so buoyed in spirit to see that this is something I accidentally stumbled into that a lot of us share. It tells me that there is a mindset to who we are, a commonality to how we think, and what we value - something  intangible that directs us to make similar choices and espouse similar devotions. I know that in my case, it is a shared spirit that guides me, but even if you dont buy into theological or mystical faiths, there is something at work here when people individually make group decisions. And the real sobering part is that this thread probably has comments from half a dozen races, two different genders, and probably several decades of ages.  to put it succinctly, 'feels good, man'  Merry Christmas."

"""Holiday"" originally meant ""holy day.""   https://www.etymonline.com/word/holiday  We often hear someone try to give a secular greeting. For example, ""Happy Holidays from all of us at CNN.""

"I’ve just realised why Trump appeals to me so much. As a child of the 70s, I think he epitomises the spirit of Punk.   The original Punk movement was a backlash against the excesses of the time in music, the arts, clothes and politics.   The bands stripped music right back to the very basics of what music could be, decrying the self-indulgence of Prog-rock. The fashion was shaped by anti-fashion, literally ripping apart the past.   It spoke to the working class who felt ignored and maligned by their “betters”.   And Trump has tapped into that vein of ‘anti’.   1) He says what he wants - Punk  2) He does what he wants - Punk  3) He doesn’t give a fuck what anyone thinks - Really Punk  4) he’s tearing up the rule book of what a “politician” and “politics” should be. Taking it out of the hands of the elite few and giving it back to the working man and woman   Donald J Trump is Punk as Fuck. The people against him are the establishment. And as every Punk knows...the establishment must be burned down. "

"Thank you for checking this out, this needs widest exposure. This post is intended clarify who we are fighting so we can turn the light on these cockroaches. Share, vote up, copy paste, repost, what ever you can do!. In all of this I now really see how important our presidents language is. He is fighting a culture war with laser precision.  First; this story starts with the spread of communism globally pre and post WWII and its movement here in the US. Please take a Look at Diana West. She is an incredibly talented investigative journalist that breaks down how the KGB organized and directed organic home grown socialist to infiltrate and operate within all institutions of US culture and government and education. NO REALLY! Sample of her talks: https://youtu.be/kf1FvXOUz6s ::: https://youtu.be/HjprabS9ZAs?t=3m56s  The subversive apparatus that was constructed here did not die with the soviet collapse it was only orphaned. One could argue that we didn't win the Cold War, we absorbed it! This explains the ""Deep (socialist) State"" and the Hostile ""Main stream Media"" In this context it really isnt fake news, its Propaganda spreading disinformation to weaken the resolve of the people and redirect them. President Donald Trump is Kryptonite to the infrastructure they have built, this is why they are exposing themselves so boldly and throw themselves on the MAGA grenade daily.  Second; 45 goals of the communist party (1963) This information was read into the congressional record in 1963. I believe you can look at the goals listed below and see the Marxist PC cultural rot we are experiencing. This list is just a start this rabbit hole is deep.  I've bolded the ones that are most relevant link http://www.citizenreviewonline.org/2010/Jun/communism.html  CURRENT COMMUNIST GOALS #1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war. #2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war. #3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength. #4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war. #5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites. #6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination. #7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N. #8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N. #9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress. #10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N. **#11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces.** (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.) #12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party. #13. Do away with all loyalty oaths. #14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office. **#15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.** **#16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights."" **#17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.** **#18. Gain control of all student newspapers.** **#19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.** **#20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policymaking positions.** **#21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.** **#22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to ""eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.""** **#23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. ""Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.""** **#24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them ""censorship"" and a violation of free speech and free press.** **#25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.** #26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as ""normal, natural, healthy."" **#27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with ""social"" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity which does not need a ""religious crutch.""** **#28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of ""separation of church and state.""** **#29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.** **#30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the ""common man.""** **#31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the ""big picture."" Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.** **#32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.** #33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus. #34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities. #35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI. **#36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.** **#37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.** #38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat]. #39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals. #40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce. **#41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.** **#42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use [""]united force[""] to solve economic, political or social problems.** #43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government. #44. Internationalize the Panama Canal. #45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction [over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction] over nations and individuals alike."
"--- **Reality Denial**  Trump has outraged the left saying Nigerians live in huts.  Well, the insular left may be surprised to know that most of Africa lives in huts.

Facts aren't racist.  Quit your bullshit, liberals.  Also, since we're talking AIDS, they have a high prevalence of [AIDS 2.9% of pop.](http://servinginnigeria.com/2016/01/11/the-african-hut/)  --- **Haitian AIDS**  As a person living (and thriving) without medication btw with hiv (allergic to it), I am not offended (or feel guilty/immoral) when Trump says Haitian immigrants have aids.  Especially when they do.  Many immigrants from Haiti are sex workers who have been created by the Clinton Foundation.  You'll find out very soon through Congressional investigations and lawsuits that Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, Her 'Cold (hearted) CHAI'--part of Clinton Foundation--and its affiliates created this mess in Haiti that has forced people to come here to seek refuge.   Here's how that happened.    If you follow George Webb's series you'll be able to understand the connections.  I'll recap them very superficially.  After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton as then acting Sec of State sent USAID money w/coordination of her foundation (see Clinton Cash) to Haiti but that Clinton Cash ended up being spent on clothing factory and ""civilization build up"" (organ clinics) in the northern coast of Haiti.  Funding a full medical tourism industry with enterprises such as roads to a hotel area just beyond the border within the Dominican Republic, Organ clinic, a hospital, helipad, and a port regularly receiving a hospital ship.  This area was very far from the earthquake affected area Port Au Prince, the southern coast of Haiti, and the medical tourism area was right next to her brother's gold mine, which has no workers or activity, but somehow still produces reports of gold and therefore money coming from it.  I guess that mine is magical, just spits out gold, and isn't a money laundering cutout.  This area then offered jobs to Haitian women in the textile factory built using CF/UNITAID/USAID money, but the deal was they had to supply their own sewing machine.  They then had to pay off the loan for it using a ""free"" smartphone given to them via their micropayments app.  The cost of these things was a lot, but the interest was astronomical 180% interest, which they were often unable to pay, forcing them into prostitution, as this employment and the terms of the contract legally bound them into a kind of astronomical cellplan based wageslavery.  Those that did not want to prostitute, or couldn't, were forced to sell their kidneys to pay off the loan.    George was calling this microloansharking, because the phone app utilized micropayments.  Webb covered this a year ago, if you want to revisit this.  I believe the Clinton Cronies involved were Mohammed Yuunus and Carlos Slim and Telmex Haiti.  Of course, forcing Haitian women into prostitution by microloansharking, forces some of them into of course AIDS.  As someone living with hiv, what I find most offensive about any public figure making statements regarding AIDS is this: any person who says that having hiv is immoral, or that they should just 'go die somewhere', or that somehow we shouldn't help people with aids because they deserve it, or--and this is the best one--***any ('known criminal') foundation that purports to stop AIDS while:   &amp;nbsp;  ***1) pricefixing AIDS drugs at an abnormally and unsustainable cost^[[pf1]](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24440)[[pf2]](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/is-the-clinton-foundation_b_13897022.html)[[pf3]](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/world/asia/01aidscnd.html) level forcing them into essentially socialism/slavery by increasingly unaffordable health care and insurance, just to live***;   &amp;nbsp;  ***2) sending watered-down AIDS drugs to Africa^[[rb1]](http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/19/exclusive-clinton-foundation-aids-program-distributed-watered-down-drugs-to-third-world-countries/#ixzz4Kt4XjT00)[[rb2]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/generic-drug-manufacturer-ranbaxy-pleads-guilty-and-agrees-pay-500-million-resolve-false)[[rb3]](http://archive.is/ABQWR)[[rb4]](https://blackburn.house.gov/uploadedfiles/clinton_foundation_report.pdf)***, (which Clinton-owned Politifact refutes by contradicting themselves with extraordinarily obvious, *weaponized sophistry* within the same passage!  For example why were most of ranbaxy's drugs adulterated but not the antiretrovirals? Also, FDA has a long history of lying about drugs, and are 0% trustworthy.  For example I myself using FOIA process, caught them using an arbitrary, devoid-of-science evaluation for determining that the DEA should place Cannabis on Schedule 1.  I found they did not evaluate ANY *nih.gov* studies on Cannabis, which--since the 1960s--counts in over 400 studies showing 'medical merit', OVER 400.  *Ad authoritariaum* fallacy arguments don't work on us anymore, since the authorities have discredited themselves so many times. I'm saying FDA is sticking up for Clinton in obvious wrongdoing)  and then of course    &amp;nbsp;  ***3) having a history of running a hiv and hepatitis C infected prisoner blood-mining program^[[akpbs1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bzwxc/bad_blood_megathread_i_want_to_remind_you_of_why/)[[akpbs322]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4jv950/clinton_scandal_you_may_not_have_heard_of/)[[akpbs2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4v0l5r/the_suppression_of_the_film_factor8_the_arkansas/)[[akpbs3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4uuxxd/factor_8_is_a_documentary_that_has_been_scrubbed/)[[akpbs4]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5a67yc/arkansas_bloodsuckers_the_clintons_prisoners_and/)[[akpbs5]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4w5ylb/victims_of_contaminated_arkansas_prison_blood/)[[akpbs6]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58eexp/ryan_white_is_a_federallyfunded_social_program_to/)[[akpbs7]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5umpjc/george_webb_discusses_the_arkansas_prison_blood/) in the 1980-1990s, which resulted in the blood being knowingly sold to Canadian pharmaceutical companies, and then to Europe, mixed together and then injected by public health programs into vulnerable, sick hemophiliac children, killing around a thousand instantly and then infecting 60,000 others with coinfections of hiv and hepatits a,b,c,d etc  and foreshortening their lives by 2 or more decades, subjecting them to awful treatments available at the time, letting [BAYER take the blame for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/549x5u/bayer_the_company_merging_with_monsanto_infected/), and then COVERING IT UP by threatening to murder a filmmaker of the documentary about the scandal***.  That's what offends me.  Someone who says they are going to fight AIDS, and they do it by running effectively a [[globalist nazi eugenics program]]^[[UN-1]](http://www.globalresearch.ca/mass-sterilization-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-un-tetanus-vaccine/5431664)[[UN-2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4uojdz/mass_sterilization_kenyan_doctors_find/d5rn0zp/) against sick European children, killing them off and then singing the praises of NGOs and Globalism.  That's that shit that keeps me up at night, and makes me so furious I'll fight them until the end of time.  Handicapped by aids or otherwise  AIDS is something we don't want any more of, trust me.  It's can be a life ruiner in many ways, forcing you into a type of wageslavery JUST LIKE THE HAITIAN WOMEN--given that the artificially high cost of aids drugs (clinton foundation) is not unlike the 180% microloansharking cell plan (you think 28% apr on your credit card is bad....)--and the only way to survive aids is being a politicaly-connected rich gay person living in a metro area in a first world country.    That's somewhere in the ballpark of  &lt; .03%-0.1% of us in America.  The rest of us are basically Haitians with a sewing machine and a smartphone, forced into servitude by vast criminal NGO globalists who want to make everyone think they are saving the planet.

They HAVE to go after her hard.  Imagine the investigators/interrogators:  ""You know you are up to your armpits in this. But look we think you are terrible and a decent scalp. You are crooked. So you can go down for this and so can you husband and the girl he threw over for you. You all go down as one big happy family. You are seen as the other woman in the situation. Everyone is talking about Peter and Lisa. I would be humiliated were I in your case, I have no idea what you feel? We will take you down.  Or we could. We don't like you but we think he is scum for what he said and how he played as this moral champion whilst having an illicit affair with your love rival, this mistress, Lisa. If you can muster some dignity and pride in yourself as a woman, give us something on these rats and make it worth our while and you will keep your pride and save your neck and get your revenge on these two loverats who humiliated you.

"Politics is just like eyeliner.  You have a left wing and a right wing, and one of them is shit.*ahem ahem liberalism*  But in all seriousness what the fuck is with this feelings bullshit. Everyone, everywhere is striving to not hurt anyones feelings bla bla bla, and being all like diversity and shit and then contradicting their own statements. Whoever said liberalism is a mental ilness is wrong. Liberalism is a global pandemic.  Ok so let me explain what i mean by this. I am not american, but for some reason, everyone is still losing their shit all the way back in the meditteranean. Last september, my country introduced a new gender (X). Fucking X. I get that its more convinient to have one identity that puts you into the special snowflake fucks that dont still think they can pick and choose their gender rather than have 46,000+ different choices, but still. Imagine trying to be friends with these people. A conversation would go as follows.  You: so whats your name Them: my name is lesley and i identify as a nonbinary otherkin fox fem genderfluid trans muslim duck. My pronouns are ze zer and xinu   In all seriousness tho jfc  Tldr: liberals need to get their shit together"

"I won’t post the full text of the email but I can tell you it was full of outright lies about the new tax plan.   Here’s an excerpt, the final paragraph:  “There is a whole lot more to this tax reform most of which I believe will benefit big corporation and the wealthy and hurt the average individual.”   I sent him an email with a point by point rebuttal sourced from the final conference bill that will be voted on this week but I don’t expect to hear back.   My family and I have been customers for 6 years. Not anymore.   Why do people have to inject political opinion into their business dealing?

"""Democrats need at least a 10-point edge to guarantee pickups on Election Day.

Conversely, Democrats led the generic ballot by just five points in Washington Post/ABC News polls conducted in the days leading up to the 1994 and 2010 elections, both big national waves in which Republicans recaptured control of the House."""

"The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States affords protection to it's citizens, against self-incrimination. It prohibits the compulsion of testimony which might place the citizen in criminal jeopardy. While these protections are a reasonable standard for criminal jeopardy, they ought not afford the individual the ability to invoke the fifth amendment to continue in the employ of the United States, while engaging in, and refusing to disclose, criminal activity.  It shall therefore be required that ANY invocation of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, or any refusal to honestly answer a direct question from a legally empaneled legislative or judicial body, be cause for immediate dismissal of said individual from employment by the United States, and immediate cessation of any compensation to that employee by the United States, to include salary, benefit, pension, and Social Security payments.  In short, you may invoke the 5th amendment as an employee of the United States, but your choice to avoid incriminating yourself will come at the cost of ANY future payments by the United States, to you.

"I am a firm believer that millennial are strongly rejecting the globalist beliefs that govern (used to) govern our country at the highest levels (some people). I am a millennial myself and I have long been searching for a way to teach my friends and family how the God King is helping this country and turning it towards her original state.   I created my first meme that has some insight as to what the president did for the American people and tax payers that could use some more money in their pocket. I hope to show this to friends and family and help them see the brighter side of politics and just how awesome our president is.   For those who believe that they need a new way to reach out to those who have not been blessed by taking the red pill, I hope this is a motivation for you. Basically, there are unconventional ways to teaching liberals and the uninformed. This is one of them.   Merry Christmas &amp; Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0mBrQm8kk&amp;t=2s"
