The New York Times, A Host of Tiles for All Inclinations," JUDITH STILES' new shop offers 50 different tile designs by the owner, a former adjunct professor of ceramics at Pratt Institute, designs of 20 other American ceramicists - and a host of services. ''We will custom-color and design tiles in solid colors or floral or geometric patterns,'' said Ms. Stiles, right, about the Manhattan store that bears her name. ''We can make relief tiles, duplicate antique tiles, match a wallpaper pattern, or take a photo of your family or dog, and render the picture realistically on a tile.'' There are tiles featuring hares, black bears, fish and raccoons, as well as a tile with a raised surface in the shape of a purple iris. Ceramicists will copy traditional Delft tiles or others to match any pottery the customer likes. In the peach-colored store, the counter functions as a work area where the customers and Ms. Stiles can rearrange tiles and experiment with different colors and patterns. For her customers, Ms. Stiles or one of her ceramicists, will make up free sample tiles, which customers can take home. A tile costs $3 or more, and is sold be the tile, not by the square foot. Examples shown include Susan Parks's tiles of stippled flowers, above left, ($15); John O'Hara's cartoons, above right, ($14), or Ms. Stiles' squiggle or geometric-patterned tile, above center ($3). To mix with the custom tiles, Ms. Stiles sells inexpensive solid-colored American Olean tiles in 40 colors, which cost 30 to 80 cents apiece, depending on the size. She also provides customers with a 21-page ''Do-It-Yourself Installation Kit.'' The store is at 392 Bleecker Street near Perry Street. HOME BEAT"
The New York Times, Keeping Boots Dry In Winter," A WALK in the snow or mud can make for wet and dirty shoes and boots. However, some devices can keep boots clean and dry them more efficiently than resting them on a radiator. The Boot 'n Shoe from Sporty's Tool Shop removes mud, snow or ice from dirty shoes and boots. The Boot 'n Shoe brush, a combination brush - with stiff, plastic bristles - and a steel scraper, costs $33.75. Sporty's also sells a shoe and boot dryer ($82.50) that dries two pairs at a time. The unit, from Norway, is wall-mounted and has four 24-inch coils that direct warm air through the shoes. A timer can be set for one minute to two hours. Another dryer, this one for $37.50, will dry tall shoes - ski boots, hiking boots and high rubber boots - overnight. Sporty's catalogue can be ordered from Clermont Airport, Batavia, Ohio 45103, telephone 513-732-2411. Smaller, portable electric boot dryers, sold through the Eddie Bauer catalogue, fit both men's and women's shoes and dry boots overnight. The manufacturer says they are designed not to crack or shrivel leather footwear. The aluminum dryers cost $22 from Eddie Bauer, Fifth Union, Post Office Box 3700, Seattle, Wash. 98124; 800-426-8020. A cast-iron boot scraper in the shape of a dog costs $33 from the Cumberland General Store, Route 3, Crossville, Tenn. 38555; 615-484-8481. A cricket bootjack, to help remove sturdy boots, is $7.70. HELPFUL HARDWARE"
The New York Times, HOME IMPROVEMENT," A WAY to lower noise levels in the home is to install acoustical materials such as ceiling tiles and wall panels. These materials absorb sound created within a room to lower the noise level in that room and in adjacent rooms. But they help only slightly to keep out noise from an adjoining room or apartment. If you live in an apartment and your neighbor is noisy, installing acoustical tile on your side of the wall is useless unless your neighbor puts acoustical material on his or her side. The same is true for noises from the room above. Acoustical tile on the ceiling will not decrease noise transmission, but covering the upstairs floor with carpeting and foam padding should be effective. To lower noise that comes through the wall, you can seal wall openings through which sound waves can travel or you can install sound-insulating materials or make alterations to walls or ceilings to isolate or block the vibrations that cause noise to travel from one room to another. Since sound waves normally travel through the air, a logical first step would be to close and seal openings through which air can enter. This would be achieved by caulking holes and openings around pipes or electrical wiring and installing weatherstripping around doors and windows. Insulation can sometimes help, but only if enough of it is used and if it can be installed inside wall, ceiling or floor cavities. Sound-deadening board will usually help slightly if installed on the surface of a wall or ceiling, but it serves as more of a sound absorber than as sound insulation. The most effective method is to structurally isolate the noise. Noise generated on one side of a wall causes vibrations on the other side. This occurs even when there is no opening through which airwaves can pass because noise creates vibrations that come through the other side. The best way to prevent this is to build two separate walls or partitions that are not in direct contact with each other (see drawing). This will prevent vibrations on one side from being transmitted to the other side. Filling the hollow spaces with bulky insulation will create an even more effective sound barrier. Since putting up a second wall or partition means losing from four to six inches of floor space inside the room, you might prefer to build a single wall with staggered studs. As illustrated in the drawing, this involves using a 2-by-6 instead of a 2-by-4 as the bottom plate, then offsetting every other stud by two inches. The result is a thicker wall with gypsum-board panels on one side nailed to a different set of studs than are the gypsum-board panels on the other side. Sound waves that cause one side to vibrate cannot affect panels on the other side. Weaving thick batts of fiberglass insulation back and forth between the studs will further help. Both techniques are mainly used in new construction or when extensive alterations involve removing or rebuilding interior walls. In existing construction,two other techniques are often used to convert an existing wall into a more-soundproof one. The simplest method involves installing a second layer of gypsum board over the existing surface. Best results are achieved if the first layer is a sound-deadening board and the second is gypsum board. The effect will be even more pronounced if this is done on both sides of the wall. In each case, the extra layer of wallboard will add bulk and mass to that wall, greatly improving the acoustical insulating abilities of any wall. A more effective way to soundproof an existing wall is to remove the gypsum board from one or both sides, then re-install it on top of resilient metal channels, as shown in the drawing. The channels are attached to the studs with screws along one edge, with the other edge left free. Drywall panels are then attached to these channels with drywall screws instead of nailing them directly to the studs. This creates a ''floating'' wall surface that will absorb vibrations without transmitting them to studs or panels on the other side. Insulating a ceiling against the transmission of noise from the room above is usually more of a problem than insulating walls. One reason is that the most common type of noise - someone walking (or stamping) across the floor - creates impact noise, which travels through joists, beams and other structural members. The only practical insulation against such noise is rebuilding the floor above so there is a layer of sound-deadening board under the finished flooring. Carpeting with a thick pad underneath would also help greatly. When there is enough headroom, noises from upstairs can also be curbed by installing a suspended ceiling that consists of an aluminum grid hung on wires below the existing ceiling. This grid supports panels of acoustical material that form the finished ceiling. The space above this can be filled with thick batts of fiberglass insulation. In rooms with insufficient headroom for a suspended ceiling, screw long lengths of resilient acoustical channel of the kind described for use on walls. The ceiling is then covered with another layer of gypsum board or sound-deadening board by attaching the panels to these channels with screws. By fastening this second layer of gypsum board to the channels instead of to the joists in the ceiling, you create a ''floating'' ceiling that isolates vibrations and helps eliminate the transmission of noise. For maximum effect, close all openings. Even the smallest hole or crack will allow sound waves to pass. Adding bulk insulation to the inside of a wall helps only if the wall (or ceiling) is built using staggered studs or with resilient channels. Adding insulation to the cavities of conventional stud walls normally will not help much. None of these techniques will help much to keep out noise that originates outside the house (unless you are ready to rebuild the exterior walls). The only ways of dealing with these noises is to install draperies or shutters over the windows, weatherstrip all doors and windows, add storm sash to all windows that face the direction of the noise and plant tall shrubs or bushes as a barrier between you and the source of the noise. Even a tall fence will help, but only if it is fairly solid with few openings."

The New York Times, Q & A," Q.You recently recommended storing a power lawn mower indoors in winter. However, I prefer not to store anything indoors that contains gasoline. I don't have a garage, but I am storing the mower in an unheated utility shed. Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply. One of the first things recommended when storing a power mower is to drain all gasoline from the tank, carburetor and fuel lines. However, storing the mower inside a cold shed will do it no harm and should not affect the engine in any way. Q.We recently moved into a house with an unheated dirt basement. We found firewood stored there, covered with mold. A strong odor of mold pervades the house. We are removing the wood. What else can we do to get rid of the moldy odor? A.First, cover the dirt floor with heavy sheet plastic or heavy tar paper. Overlap strips at least 6 inches and lap them up onto the walls 8 to 10 inches on all sides. Hold the plastic in place with bricks or cement blocks. Be sure the basement area is well ventilated with louvered openings on opposite sides for cross ventilation. The openings should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of unobstructed area for every 1,500 square feet of floor area in the basement (screens and louvers over the vents cut the actual size of the opening by half). Q.My family room has a concrete slab floor that is very cold in the winter. It is about a foot lower than the first floor, so I may add a ''false'' insulated floor on top of the slab. I plan to put down 2-by-4's with 5/8-inch plywood on top, filling the spaces between the 2-by-4's with fiberglass insulation. The insulation will have a foil vapor barrier on one side. Where should the vapor barrier go - on the bottom, against the concrete, or on the top, directly under the plywood? A.Always put the vapor barrier on the warmer side of the insulation - the side facing the heated area in the winter. Your vapor barrier should be on top of the insulation, directly under the plywood. Q.Our concrete basement walls are covered with a white crystalline substance that looks something like a powdery dusting of snow. After we washed a portion of the wall off with bleach and water the substance seemed to ''grow'' back. What can be used to remove this? A.This substance is the result of efflorescence. It is caused by the release of alkaline salts that leach out of the concrete when there is dampness present and when there are excess alkalies in the masonry. You can get rid of the powder by washing with a mild solution of muriatic acid (one part acid to five parts water). This neutralizes the alkalies and washes off the white powder. There is no guarantee that the efflorescence won't come back, unless you can eliminate the dampness. Applying a masonry paint or sealer sometimes helps, but not always.

The New York Times, Subway Chic Is Coming Down the Track at You," To the Editor: The French are not the only ones to think subway system-inspired designs are chic (''Transit Chic,'' editorial Topics, Dec. 22). London Transport also sells T-shirts, greeting cards, jigsaw puzzles, teapot stands, dishes and a wide range of other items bearing representations of the system map, buses and station names. Both licensing programs have substantial financial benefit for their respective agencies: Paris's Regie Autonome des Transports Parisiens earned $1.5 million in royalty payments in 1985; London Transport earns more than $2 million a year. Several North American transportation agencies, including those in Boston, Montreal, San Francisco and Toronto are looking into licensing their logos and other symbols. In its recent report on marketing at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A recommended that New York's transportation agency do the same. Licensing, we believe, could not only raise a few million dollars for the M.T.A., by making New York's transit systems seem as chic as Paris's with its little yellow ticket, but a licensing campaign might also convince a few more metropolitan-area residents and workers to get out of autos, taxis and express buses, and back onto subways, buses and trains. New York needs its transportation system to support its economy - and the transit system needs its riders. In this period of rebuilding and refurbishing at the M.T.A., we feel licensing would be a good step toward marketing its newly clean and efficient services.

The New York Times, Was It Just a Scheme To Pay for the Contras?," To the Editor: Most accounts of the Iran-contra connection ascribe various motives for the National Security Council sale of weapons to Iran - to improve U.S.-Iran relations, to support moderate elements in Iran, to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon - and treat the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contras as incidental or as an afterthought. But what if N.S.C. officials sold arms to Iran with the primary purpose of raising funds for use in Nicaragua? This interpretation appears consistent with N.S.C. attempts to raise funds for the contras (e.g., from Brunei) and with the fact that Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the central figure in the affair, had responsibility primarily for Nicaraguan, not Iranian affairs. M. D.

The New York Times, Incentives to Put More Air Bags in Cars," To the Editor: We were very pleased by your editorial support last June for regulatory incentives to encourage air-bag production in new cars. In light of this position, we were very disappointed to read your news coverage of our proposal to provide just such incentives (news story, Nov. 22), which may have been misleading. Our standards require that 10 percent of all new cars manufactured for sale in the United States have automatic crash protection, such as automatic safety belts or air bags. This percentage will increase until Sept. 1, 1989, when all new cars must be so equipped. This regulatory deadline has not changed since it was established in 1984. Contrary to the suggestions in your article, our recent proposal does not affect that deadline. The rule requires automatic protection for both the driver and the right-front-seat passenger. In order to encourage the production of air bags, the rule allows a car that contains a driver-side air bag to be considered in compliance with the rule. Ford Motor Company asked us to consider extending that incentive, and our recent proposal would do so temporarily, for four years. If a manufacturer does not choose to install air bags (or, what the regulatory jargon refers to as ''nonbelt technology''), the manufacturer must comply with the original rule and provide automatic protection for both the driver and the passenger. In that case, the protection would in all likelihood be provided by means of automatic safety belts, as your editorial noted. We strongly believe that this incentive will encourage the production of greater numbers of air bags for the driver's side than we would have seen under the original rule, and will also encourage the orderly development and production of passenger-side air bags. The proposal has been supported publicly by safety advocates, including the National Safety Council, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, numerous insurance companies and other organizations. Your editorial in support of Ford's proposal urged us to ''meet Ford at least part way,'' to stimulate the engineers and to assist the domestic auto industry in meeting foreign competition. I particularly take issue with the news article's characterization of our proposal as ''the latest in a series of moves aimed at relaxing Federal regulation of the automobile industry.'' Our proposal would not delay or relax the automatic crash protection rule. Rather, it proposes an incentive that is available only to those manufacturers who choose to employ a more expensive, highly effective safety technology - the air bag. DIANE K. STEED  Washington, Dec. 17, 1986  The writer is National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator, Department of Transportation."
The New York Times, New York City Environment Cleared in Cleopatra's Needle Case," To the Editor: I was pleased with Robert Whiteford's affection for our obelisk (which was a gift to New York City, by the way, not to the nation), but disturbed over the canard about ''the damage done in less than 100 years'' (''Disappearing Needle,'' letter, Dec. 16). This has often been asserted by thoughtless geologists and journalists (a writer in Smithsonian magazine declared that the pair of obelisks left Egypt, one for New York and its mate for London, ''in mint condition''). In 1965, however, a temperate writer stated, ''the disastrous disintegration rate of granite in city atmosphere, as exemplified by Cleopatra's Needle, is a myth,'' adding, ''It is therefore hoped that the obelisk will be eliminated from textbooks of physical geology as a 'good example of weathering in cities.' '' Historically, the New York obelisk, which Napoleon had intended for France when he saw it, was subsequently refused because of poor condition, in favor of the well-preserved Luxor shaft removed to Paris in 1836. The London twin to New York was rejected in 1849 for the same reason. In the 19th century there were observations of native vendors peddling granite chips from the obelisk at the site in Alexandria. In New York, in 1891, it was observed of the Needle's west face that ''the abrasion caused by the sand of the Libyan desert has effaced almost every hieroglyph on this side of the obelisk.'' Conservation began early. The tip was said to have been repaired in Alexandria circa 1880. During re-erection in New York in 1881, some structural repairs were made (note replacements in the limestone foundation steps; the bronze crabs were replacements forged at the Brooklyn Navy Yard). By 1885, 780 pounds of granite scale were removed from the shaft, which was then treated with paraffin. As for the resistance of such granite in New York's climate, there are miles of curbstone regularly polluted by exhausts and urine, and exterior building walls (e.g., the Museum of Natural History), in good condition. Meanwhile, the obelisk, in Central Park, on its knoll, amid the trees, behind the sheltering wall of the museum, away from the motor traffic, appears to be ideally sited; when conditions become severe, it will also be time to put Trinity Church, the Public Library and City Hall under glass. Incidentally, the literature, considerable and thorough (woodcut illustrations of the hieroglyphs were published in the 1650's), is available in the public library. FRED BRAUEN  Jackson Heights, Queens, Dec. 16, 1986"
The New York Times, How to Test the Temperature of the Economy," To the Editor: Your Dec. 3 report that the Government's index of leading economic indicators was up by .6 percent for October (Business Day), stated, ''Most analysts, however, took little comfort in the latest figures, asserting that they most likely pointed to a continuation of lackluster economic growth in the months ahead.'' We believe that such an interpretation of the near-term prospects for the United States economy is misleading if it is based on the October 1986 data in the Department of Commerce composite index of leading indicators. The composite index is part of a system of three composite indexes of leading, coincident and lagging indicators. Each indicator in this system has been carefully subjected to a sophisticated statistical program of standardization, weighting and averaging with other indicators in the process of constructing the composite indexes. The resulting composite indexes represent summary measures designed to signal changes in the direction of aggregate economic activity, e.g., the gross national product. They are not designed to estimate magnitude of change. Therefore, it is inappropriate to state that the October figures ''most likely pointed to a continuation of lackluster economic growth.'' The system of indexes of leading indicators is described in the Department of Commerce's Handbook of Cyclical Indicators (1984), which states clearly (page 65) that ''Each index measures the average behavior of a group of economic time series that show similar timing at business cycle turns but represent widely differing activities or sectors of the economy.'' The 12 indexes that tend to lead at business cycle turns are combined and classified as leading indicators, the 4 indicators that tend to coincide with the cyclical peak are classified as coincident indicators, and the 6 that tend to lag are classified as lagging indicators. A fourth measure, the ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, is added to confirm the movement in the composite index of leading indicators. While this system of indicators has performed well in the last 40 years in foreshadowing turning points in the general economy, it requires professional experience to interpret the monthly movements in the underlying data and a sophisticated analysis to apply such data to the near-term outlook for various industries or sectors in the economy. Monthly movements in the composites of the leading indicators, the coincident indicators, the lagging indicators and the ratio of coincident to lagging indicators should be interpreted together with other factors in the system, such as monetary policy, fiscal policy and the international economy before the analyst can venture an opinion on the rate of the economy's growth in the months ahead. One month's worth of statistics for a volatile, complex series such as the composite index of leading indicators does not suffice to establish a new trend in either direction. It takes at least six months of data to identify a trend with a high degree of confidence. Accepting one month of such statistical data always leads to misleading information and erroneous conclusions about the future course of the economy. ALAN E.

The New York Times, HERS," THE 17th century was an important period of transition for both women writers and women readers. Before 1600 no more than a trickle of writing by women saw print. By the beginning of the 18th century, however, numbers of women not only published their work but also made a living from it. At the same time women readers were starting to make their presence felt. Just a few years later they would be legion, an audience large enough to support the burgeoning novel and the soon-to-be-established institution of the lending library. One of the earliest publishers to recognize the new audience of women was the London bookseller John Dunton. He did not, it must be admitted, come upon the idea all on his own; it more or less came upon him. In 1691 Dunton founded The Athenian Mercury, a biweekly magazine whose purpose was to resolve ''all nice and curious questions.'' Readers were invited to send their queries ''by penny post to Smith's Coffee-House in Stocks Market in the Poultry.'' To Dunton's surprise, one of the first letters was from a ''gentle-woman'' who wished to know whether women as well as men might send questions. Dunton replied affirmatively and on May 23, 1691, the magazine printed her queries. She wanted to know, first of all, whether ''beauty be real or imaginary.'' Both, the Mercury answered: although social custom as well as the individual eye determines what the standard of beauty is to be, some things are ''shaped more neat, cleverly and handsome than others, as we may grossly see in a horse compared with an elephant, a greyhound with a swine or cur.'' The woman's most pressing question, however, was less generally philosophic: Was it ''proper for women to be learned?'' Some people believe, the editor replied, that a woman is learned enough if she can ''distinguish between her husband's breeches and another man's,'' but ''we see no reason why women should not be learned now,'' as they were in former times. Having admitted the fair sex to its forum, the Mercury found their questions so ''pressing and numerous'' that it decided to oblige them by setting aside the first Tuesday in every month especially for them. Thus, the first ''women's page'' was born. Some women sent in questions having to do with love and marriage, but others ranged over all the field of knowledge as it was then constituted, from philosophy and religion to jurisprudence, literature, the natural world and the supernatural. The curious wanted to be informed about such matters as the science of motion; the cause of the winds rising and falling; whether fishes smell, taste and hear. A literary lady asked whether the Athenians thought Sappho or Aphra Behn were the better poetess. The first women's page was such a success that after two years John Dunton ventured yet another innovation: a magazine designed entirely for female readers. Ladies Mercury began publication on ''Munday'' Feb. 28, 1693. The layout of the new magazine was the same as that of The Athenian Mercury, but the subject matter was very different. In the first issue a letter explained that the Ladies Mercury ''yielded up'' to The Athenian Mercury the ''examination of learning, nature, arts, sciences and indeed the whole world, being contented to bound our narrow speculation to only that little sublunary woman.'' The second issue of the Ladies Mercury reminded readers that the magazine only dealt with questions of love, marriage and domestic concerns, and stipulated that it not be ''troubled with other questions relating to learning, religion, etc.'' Thus circumscribed, Ladies Mercury began to repeat itself. Whereas The Athenian Mercury had leaped happily from subject to subject, its offshoot retailed the same advice to the same questions more and more dispiritedly. After only five issues, publication ceased. It is not hard to guess why the Ladies Mercury failed. Clearly, its original female audience was interested in the same subject matter as the male readers. A significant body of women readers were eager to be informed about the arts and sciences, history, the world, but Dunton's publication had arbitrarily limited the subject matter to what might be seen as the purely personal. In the 1970's feminists protested the assumption that ''traditional'' feminine concerns were trivial. They soon established the value of personal experience as an important subject to explore and eventually transformed the landscape of writing by and about women. The new writing was for a time refreshing and, more than that, gave voice to a whole new range of experience. It was with a new sense of freedom that women wrote about their emotions, marriages, divorces and child-bearing. But it seems to me that this mode has become repetitious. Without reference to the arts and sciences, to language, imagination, ideas, the purely personal is stripped of its power. Without connection to the ''world,'' it risks becoming sterile. When we focus too exclusively on the digestion of our own personal experiences, we not only revisit the limitations of the traditonal ''woman's sphere'' but also sadly circumscribe our horizons of interest and possible worlds."
The New York Times, Social Security Benefits Rise," The new year is bringing a 1.3 percent benefit increase to the nation's 37 million Social Security beneficiaries and an end to the temporary respite from the payroll tax for 8.5 million Americans who paid the maximum levy in 1986. It took earnings of $42,000 or more in 1986 to earn a break from the Social Security tax. But in 1987, taxpayers will have to earn $43,800 before the payroll tax ends for the year. Although the tax rate remains unchanged at 7.15 percent, the increase in the wage ceiling to $43,800 means the maximum tax on employees will rise to $3,131.70. That is $128.70, or 4.3 percent, more than 1986's top tax. Employers pay the same amount. The average monthly benefit for retired workers will rise by $6, to $488. For an elderly couple, the average payment will go up by $11, to $833. But most of the elderly will find their ''take home'' pay from Social Security going up less than $6 because they will be charged $2.40 more each month for Medicare coverage. The benefit increase matches the change in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of 1985 through the third quarter of 1986. It is the smallest rise since Social Security was linked to the price index in 1975."
The New York Times, Saudi Budget Introduced," Saudi Arabia introduced its long-awaited budget today, cutting spending for 1987 by 6 percent and projecting a deficit of 52.7 billion riyals, or about $14 billion, to be funded out of reserves. Oil revenues will cover only about 40 percent of expenditures, and military spending will again take up more than a third of the budget. Politically sensitive subsidies on basic food items were broadly unchanged. In a speech Monday, King Fahd had warned that the budget would involve cuts, but he reassured the Saudi people that key subsidies would not be touched. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was hit hard this year by the fall in crude prices and twice postponed its budget, originally due to be announced last March. It has now redefined its fiscal year to coincide with the Western calendar, although Wednesday's budget was officially designated 1407-08 under the Islamic system. A Finance Ministry statement, distributed to newspapers in the kingdom by the Saudi Press Agency, said 1987 spending would total 170 billion riyals, or about $45.3 billion, and revenue 117.3 billion riyals, about $31.3 billion."
The New York Times, Singapore's Growth Rate," Singapore's economic growth rate is beginning to improve, but still needs wage restraint to return to full health, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in a year-end message today. The real growth rate after inflation in 1987 is expected to be between 3 and 4 percent, compared with 1.9 percent projected for this year, he said. In 1985, the economy shrank nearly 2 percent, after growing 8.2 percent a year earlier. The Prime Minister said manufacturing was beginning to pick up, but commerce, banking and building activity were still depressed. Despite holding down wage increases, Singapore had still not recovered its competitiveness against countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. ''We need at least one more year of high-productivity growth and wage restraint to close the gap,'' he said."

The New York Times," RADON: FOR THE HOMEOWNER, SOME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS"," IN the last year or so, the radioactive gas radon has emerged as perhaps the nation's leading environmental threat to health. The risk it poses is lung cancer, and experts at the Environmental Protection Agency estimate that radon may cause 5,000 to 20,000 of the nation's deaths from lung cancer each year. The American Cancer Society predicted that in 1986 about 130,000 people would die of lung cancer. Radon's existence outdoors is ubiquitous. It comes from the natural decay chain of uranium 238, which is radioactive and a common element in rock and soil. Outside, radon dissipates quickly and is not regarded as a serious health risk. The hazard, however, arises indoors. In the last two years, scientists became aware that levels in homes can be far higher than ever imagined. The Federal Enviromental Protection Agency said in August that perhaps 8 million of the nation's 70 million homes had radon levels above its recommended guideline. Radon experts in the scientific community are more conservative, saying that the number may be closer to five million. Despite their differing assessments, Government and private scientists stress the need to educate the public, particularly homeowners, on radon's threats. Following are some common questions about radon in the home: Q.Why is radon considered dangerous? A.The gas, which is odorless, invisible and tasteless, is not the culprit. But as it decays, it produces polonium 218 and polonium 214. They both emit radioactive alpha particles that can cling to dust. Inhaled, they can lodge in the lung's sensitive airways and experts say it can possibly cause lung cancer after latency periods of 20 to 30 years. Q.By what process does radon enter homes? A.The gas is sucked in from the soil. Most common pathways are cracks in cellar floors, walls or joints; sump drains; openings around water and gas pipes, and the hollow interiors of cinder blocks. Q.How is it drawn inside the home? A.Most commonly, scientists say, by negative air pressure created inside the home. Q.How does that sort of pressure occur? A.Furnaces and exhaust fans are common causes. As they consume indoor air, interior air pressure drops below the pressure in the ground, creating a suction effect that pulls radon gas from soil in through the minute passageways. Anything that draws air adds to the suction effect, including fireplaces, range hoods, water heaters and washers and dryers. Also, pressure differences can be created by wind, the placement of windows and a home's heating system. Causes are not always obvious, which makes testing important in those areas identified as vulnerable. In homes using well water, any radon in the water can enter via faucets, shower nozzles and dish and clothes washers. But the levels are usually far below those from soil gas, unless the well water itself has very high levels. Water that comes from reservoirs and rivers does not pose a problem, experts say. Q.How do I know what the radon level is in my home? A.You cannot know without having a professional perform a test. Q.Who will perform the testing procedure? A.Commercial testing companies, which usually charge $25 to $50 per each small testing device placed in the home. There are two such devices - charcoal canisters and alpha-track detectors. The testing industry is nascent, so beware of con artists and the unscrupulous. State health and radiation-protection offices have been refining their lists of reputable laboratories and will provide names free. In New York State, call 518-473-3613 or 800-342-3722. In New Jersey, 800-648-0394. In Connecticut, 203-566-8167. In Massachussetts, 617-727-6214. The Environmental Protection Agency's regional offices also have lists of companies. For residents of New Jersey and New York call the E.P.A. New York office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10278; 212-224-2514. Residents of New England should contact the E.P.A. Boston office, Room 2203, J.F.K. Federal Buildling, Boston, Mass. O2203; 617-565- 3234. Residents of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Washington D.C., Virgina and West Virginia, should contact the E.P.A. Philadelphia office at 841 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107; 215-597-8320 These E.P.A. offices can also provide two free up-to-date booklets on radon, ''A Citizen's Guide to Radon: What It Is and What to Do About It'' and ''Radon Reduction Methods: A Homeowner's Guide.'' Q.What indoor radon levels concern scientists? A.There is disagreement here. E.P.A.'s guideline is 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air. Anything above that should be reduced, the agency says. Private experts think that level is too alarmist. Dr. Naomi Harley, a radiation expert and professor of environmental medicine at the New York University Medical Center, says the guideline should be 8 picocuries per liter. Experts do agree, however, that homes with high levels of radon need immediate attention, while those with levels under 8 or 10 picocuries are not as urgent. Q.What is a measuring unit called a picocurie? A.A picocurie is a measurement of airborne radon gas. It is one-trillionth of a curie and represents the decay of two radon atoms per minute. Q.Is there another type of measurement? A.Yes, another measurement is called ''working levels,'' or WL. A ''working level'' is a measure of radon's alpha-emitting decay products, polonium 218 and polonium 214. The two methods of measurement are interchangeable. It is important to know how to figure both, as some private radon-testing laboratories use only one or the other. There are 200 picocuries per 1 working level. To convert a picocurie measurement to WL, divide the picocurie reading by 200. Thus, 200 picocuries is the same as 1 WL. The E.P.A. standard of 4 picocuries per liter of air is .02 WL. Q.Are indoor levels of the gas constant? A.No. They are highest at cellar or ground-level entry points and decline on upper floors. They can also vary day-to-day and season-to-season. So, a longer testing period, preferably months, gives a better average reading. Levels in neighboring houses can vary widely, depending on differences in construction and soil textures. Q.What levels of radon cause cancer? A.This cannot be predicted with absolute certainty. But obviously the higher the level, the greater the danger. The E.P.A. estimates ranges of fatal lung cancers for various radon levels. These risks presuppose a person being exposed to a particular level for 75 percent of the time for 70 years. Critics argue that this exposure time is unrealistic, but Government specialists say they want to be conservative. The E.P.A. estimates that if 1,000 people are exposed to a level of 4 picocuries for 75 percent of the time for 70 years, 13 to 50 of them will contract fatal lung cancer. In homes with levels of 10 picocuries, of which experts estimate there are 700,000 nationally, the death risk increases to from 30 to 120 for each 1,000 people exposed. Scientific experts like Dr. Harley argue that those ratios are far too high. Based on studies of uranium miners, Dr. Harley says the 4-picocurie per liter standard's death risk is 9 per thousand people for a lifelong exposure. Despite this disagreement, Federal and scientific experts agree that radon is a greater risk than more widely publicized threats like asbestos, toxic waste dumps and dioxin. Q.Will states perform tests in homes? A.By winter's end, the New York State Department of Health plans to start a $3 million testing program for thousands of homes. Homeowners able to prove by receipts that they initiated energy conservation measures in the home can get free detectors; others will pay about $20, officials say. Q.Are states looking for hot spots? A.Many have begun investigations. New York State recently projected - based on a sample of 2,400 homes - that 95 percent of the 2.6 million single-family homes across the state have radon levels at or below the Federal guideline of four picocuries per liter. Officials said, however, that the sampling could not rule out the existence of localized radon hot spots. New Jersey plans to test 6,000 buildings statewide in coming months and Connecticut 1,500. The worst known hot spot in the country is Clinton, N.J., a rural town of about 2,000 15 miles east of the Delaware River. There 105 homes atop a uranium-laden limestone cliff had readings above the E.P.A.'s 4 picocurie per liter standard. Of them, 35 were at or above 200 picocuries and 5 were above 1,000. Q.What was done as a result of those readings? A.Since late spring, the E.P.A. has turned 10 homes with the highest levels into a research laboratory, testing and perfecting technology to reduce the radon. They are pleased with the results. Six of the 10 now have levels below the standard, according to Alfred B. Craig, head of the E.P.A. research team. Q.What methods were found successful? A.A reduction system called ''sub-slab ventilation.'' Several pipes were placed through the cellar floors into gravel bases beneath them and then linked to a single pipe running upward in the home to the roof. An exhaust fan atop the roof outlet drew the radon up through the piping and out into the air. Professional installation of this system can cost up to $3,000. It was done free in Clinton as an experiment. Q.What are other reduction methods? A.The Environmental Protection Agency's booklet ''Radon Reduction Methods'' outlines nine, their likely cost and their effectiveness. Marginal or low radon readings can usually be reduced by sealing basement walls and floor cracks and covering drain and utility pipe openings, covering exposed soil and using natural or forced ventilation. Professional advice is usually necessary and success of any measures should be verified by retesting. For homes with readings of 10 picocuries or less, Mr. Craig reports considerable success with a ventilation system called the air-to-air heat exchanger that expels contaminated air and replaces it with an equal amount of fresh outside air. Described in the E.P.A. booklet, the cost ranges from $400 to $1,500. Q.If I'm buying a home, should I get an inspection? A.The experts advise yes. Most predict that a radon inspection one day will be as commonplace in housing sales as a termite inspection. The National Association of Realtors says that a sales agent must inform a buyer if the agent believes a home is in a radon-prone area. Failure of a sales agent to tell a buyer facts affecting a home's value, including past radon detection, could violate the association's code of ethics and expose the agent to civil suit, according to Walter Molony, an association spokesman.

The New York Times, FAMILIES PLEASED WITH 'OPEN ADOPTIONS'," Nine months after the ''open adoption'' of Erin McGarvey became final, the biological and adoptive parents of the 3-year-old retarded child agree that the unusual arrangement to share her is working well. Erin's biological mother said she had not seen her daughter for about six months but found comfort in knowing that when she wanted to see and hold her she could. Her husband, Erin's biological father, takes Erin's older sister to visit the child about every six weeks. Erin's two families live a few miles apart. In her adoptive family, Erin has four older sisters, including one who was also adopted, an older brother, a dog, a rabbit and three cats. ''It's very advantageous for her to be in a family with other children, which is exactly what her parents wanted for her,'' said her adoptive mother, Carol McGarvey. ''She became so animated because there is just so much going on.'' When she arrived at the McGarveys' home in this section of Barnstable on Cape Cod, Erin, who has Down's syndrome, was unable to sit up. Today, she has begun to walk and talk and has the development level of an 18-month-old. Her biological parents and 8-year-old sister form part of an extended family, according to Mrs. McGarvey. ''They're there for financial support,'' she said. ''They're there for emotional support. They're there if we need it.'' They have brought over some of their older daughter's clothes ''as if passing down items from one child to another like she's still in the family,'' Mrs. McGarvey said. They also have brought Erin gifts. ''Yes, it's working out,'' said Mrs. McGarvey. ''We're still really glad we did it.'' Erin's adoption attracted nationwide attention when it became final March 14, although the surrender papers had been signed in June 1985. Her biological mother said she decided to give Erin up after keeping her for 14 months because the child's needs overwhelmed her. She had lost a baby to meningitis nearly three years earlier and her husband, a fisherman, was often away from home, making it difficult to deal with Erin, she said. It was ''probably the most wrenching decision a woman would have to make,'' she said, and ''I just have to to be real positive about the choice and know that I did it out of love for Erin.'' ''I can honestly say I don't regret the decision,'' the 34-year-old biological mother, who asked not to be identified, said in a recent interview. ''Of course, I can honestly say, I wish I never had to go through it.'' The family did not put Erin up for adoption at birth because her husband thought it was ''too dramatic a step to take,'' she said. But she said she felt a bit apathetic toward the baby because of her own bitter feelings. ''I suppose the martyr thing to have done would have been to keep Erin for all the wrong reasons and I could have been as miserable as I wanted behind my closed doors,'' she said. Mrs. McGarvey said she understood and admired Erin's biological mother. ''I think it is absolutely fantastic,'' she said, ''to be able to put aside all your motherly feeling and say, 'This is what I have to do for what's best for her.' I think it's the most unselfish thing you could do.'' ''I feel I've said my goodbyes,'' said Erin's biological mother. ''There will be a need for me in another six months to see her,'' she said. ''I can feel it building. The special kind of bond I feel for Erin won't die.''"

The New York Times, Semiconductor Loss Narrows," The National Semiconductor Corporation, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it lost $5.7 million in its second quarter, narrowed sharply from the $38.3 million loss reported a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 14 rose 31 percent, to $456.8 million, from $349.2 million a year ago. The second-quarter results included a provision of about $7.5 million related to reductions in employment that were initiated during the quarter. ''During the second quarter, the Semiconductor Group reported a moderate gain in sales and a major improvement in operating performance as compared to the last year,'' Charles E. Sporck, National's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''However, operating performance declined compared to the first quarter because of reduced bookings during the summer.'' Mr. Sporck added that semiconductor order rates have improved since the summer, and he expects that improvement to continue at a modest level in 1987. He also said continued growth for the company would come from a new generation of National Advanced Systems products, the Hitachi mainframe computers that National sells, as well as new point-of-sale products from its Datachecker unit."
The New York Times," TV: 'MUSICAL KIDS,' ON PHILADELPHIA YOUTH"," ''Musical Kids'' is subtitled ''A Celebration of Philadelphia's Settlement Music School,'' and why not? The school, as seen in the 30-minute film on Channel 13 at 10:30 tonight, is an admirable place - dead serious, and at the same time a home to deep pleasure. A celebration does seem in order. The school, founded in 1908 as part of the settlement-house movement, now teaches some 3,000 students. ''Musical Kids,'' produced and directed by Peggy Daniel, visits classes. No one, apparently, forces the young people to attend. They make music because they want to. Meanwhile, we get a sense of an amiable autocracy at work. Students may indeed look rapt and happy, but the teachers are in charge. ''Good students should be able to read music like a novel,'' a teacher says firmly. A student says the teacher is trying to cram four years of theory into less than one year. The system seems to work. ''Musical Kids'' notes, as evidence, that graduates of the Settlement Music School include 30 present or former members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, composers who have won Pulitzer Prizes and Oscars, Chubby Checker and Clamma Dale. On the other hand, the school doesn't exist only to train professionals; it exists because it's in the great tradition of settlement houses. It fills a social need. ''Musical Kids'' doesn't come down too heavily here, and it doesn't succumb to sentimentality. But it does show us young people of all kinds making music and enriching and widening their lives. The executive director, Robert Capanna, says the school wants to involve everyone in the community. We can't tell how successful it is at doing this, although the film, presented on public television by WHYY of Philadelphia, indicates that the school does try. ''Musical Kids'' is a beguiling film about an enchanting institution."
The New York Times, JAZZ: GREY AND TATE," The trombonist Al Grey and the saxophonist Buddy Tate, both seasoned veterans of many years with the Count Basie orchestra, are constantly on the road now, either together or singly. They travel the world, picking up local rhythm sections to play with them. This week Mr. Tate and Mr. Grey are home for the holidays at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, between 11th and Perry Streets, through Sunday, with a superb ''local'' rhythm section made up of musicians as widely traveled as they - Sir Roland Hanna on piano, Major Holley on bass and the drummer Bobby Durham, on leave from Ella Fitzgerald. Despite the Basie backgrounds of Mr. Tate and Mr. Grey, there is almost as much of Duke Ellington in their style and repertory as there is of Basie. This comes not only from Mr. Grey's Ellingtonian growling with a plunger mute, or Mr. Tate's swaggering sweep, but also from Mr. Hanna, who, in this group, becomes a straight-ahead swinger rather than the more complex and innovative pianist he is apt to be in his solo or trio performances. He plays much of the time with a punchy drive that suggests the open, swinging joy of the Basie band, but when the group takes up the Duke's ''C Jam Blues,'' his solo contribution is a railroad blues with spare, ringing Ellington chords. Mr. Tate plays clarinet with increasing frequency these days, using a warm, mellow tone that is particularly effective in the bending, shimmering lines of ''Blue Tate,'' on which Mr. Grey gives a masterful demonstration of the soft, cushioned, distant sound that he can achieve with his normally growling or raucous plunger mute."
The New York Times, Canadians Start Mortgage Market," The Canadian Government has opened a new major market of mortgage-backed securities, modeled after the hugely successful program in the United States. Analysts expect the value of the market to exceed $250 million (Canadian), or $180 million (United States), by the end of 1987 and then grow dramatically in 1988 and 1989. Market watchers, however, said the market would initially suffer teething problems because of the complex nature and novelty of the investment instruments. ''The U.S. mortgage-backed securities market is probably the most innovative yet complex securities market in the world,'' said James Stevens, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. The Canadian Government, looking to increase funds available for mortgages and spark a revival in long-term mortgages, will guarantee repayment of the securities for investors. Mr. Stevens noted that the new securities have the growth potential of mortgage-backed securities sold in the United States by the Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association. Initially, he added, the new securities will attract the smaller investor, but once larger issues with longer terms are offered, the big institutions will become involved. Because the securities are exempt from Canadian withholding taxes, there is expected to be considerable foreign interest. Foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, are playing an increasingly large role in the Canadian bond market."
The New York Times, NEW LOOK FOR HISTORIC HOUSES: ACCURACY REPLACES IDEALISM," CURATORS of historic houses are responding to new technologies and methods of research to change the long-cherished Colonial Revival taste, which governed earlier room restorations. From the 1930's through the 1970's, experts say, many rooms in these houses were furnished according to an idealized version of 18th- and early 19th-century elegance. According to Christine Meadows, curator of Mount Vernon, during those five decades historical accuracy was considered secondary to ''making the room settings pretty, warm and attractive.'' Visitors to the Governor's Palace at Colonial Williamsburg and to Mount Vernon and Gunston Hall, which are near Washington, are seeing rerestored rooms, simpler and brighter, shorn of their Colonial Revival trappings of fussy curtains, heavy rugs and drably painted walls. These changes have been brought about by the results of three areas of research: advances in chemical-analysis techniques, which have shown a wide range of brighter colors; new methods of interior archeology, using special lights and filters to reveal lost architecural elements, and the increased scholarship and use of period inventories as prime resources. John Davis, senior curator of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, describes the changes at the Governor's Palace as ''a shift away from the 1930's view of decorative arts as fine arts into the contemporary social-cultural approach.'' By meticulously following the 15,000-item inventory made at the death in 1770 of Baron de Botetourt, sixth Governor of the Virginia Colony, as well as his butler's account books recently uncovered at Badminton House in England, curators have been able to discern the palace's arrangements during his tenure. Over the past seven years, the Governor's Palace has been completely rerestored to reflect the findings of the inventory. In the 1930's reconstruction, the dining room was furnished with a single banquet table. The inventory, however, indicated a more multiuse room. Now there are two smaller dining tables, 12 mahogany chairs, smoking chairs, writing desks, library tables and ink stands for the gentlemen who lingered over port and politics after dinner. Even the paint color is different. In another document, ''The Executive Journals of the Council'' of 1727, the curators discovered that the dining room had been newly painted in a pearl color. Off came the stone-gray paint of the 1930's in favor of a pearly color with a touch of blue. Curtains and floor coverings are usually the areas that are changed. Research shows that certain 18th-century window treatments were less ornate than Colonial Revivalists believed and that sea-grass matting was used instead of Oriental rugs. Often floorboards were simply left bare. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in George Washington's study at Mount Vernon, which has been rerestored in recent years, according to his death inventory of 1799. Formerly, the room had dark stained floors and white-painted bookshelves. It was formally furnished with a wing chair, a Queen Anne side chair, an Oriental rug and damask drapes copied from a Chippendale pattern. The floors have been stripped and the paneling and window frames have been painted in a rediscovered faux-bois pattern. The Oriental rug has been removed, as has the Queen Anne chair. What remains is a stand-up desk, Washington's dressing table, a book press, a globe of the world and windows that are bare, without draperies - simple necessities for an early-rising plantation owner. Gone are the days when Mount Vernon's curators only flirted with the inventory and accepted as gifts furnishings not necessarily correct. In 1979, Matthew J. Mosca, a conservator of architectural finishes, was hired to analyze and ascertain the original paint colors. ''Formerly, we used only the scraping technique and matched the color at the right chronological level,'' said Miss Meadows, the curator of Mount Vernon. ''The color we were big on was putty.'' Over the years, the original colors were altered by air, light and dirt to become putty-colored. Mount Vernon's dining room now sparkles in verdigris, a 1980's change. ''Frequently forgotten,'' Miss Meadows added, ''is that interior illumination was a scarce commodity in 1799 so everything had to reflect and enhance light.'' As in other historic houses now being rerestored, Mount Vernon's bright new paints were custom-mixed using 18th-century formulas and applied with traditional round hog-bristle brushes. These brushes pick up the pigments in layers and create more luminescent surfaces. Gunston Hall, a one-and-a-half-story brick Georgian house on the Potomac River south of Mount Vernon, was the home of George Mason, who drafted the Bill of Rights. Designed in the late 1750's by William Buckland, an English indentured servant, Gunston Hall displays the earliest example of chinoiserie carving in the colonies. Although many clues about the original interiors were previously researched, the 1950 restoration gave the house only a nonspecific English elegance, according to its curator, Susan Borchardt. Architectural detective work began in 1981, using red-glass filters and black light to discover both incorrect moldings and the placement of lost architectural elements. The missing Doric entablature beneath the crown molding in the entrance hall was reconstructed last year. Curators think that the original was probably removed and sold in the 19th century. High-intensity light revealed ghosts - the bare outlines of the long-gone molding's metopes and triglyphs. Larry Jones, a restoration craftsman working at Gunston Hall, has used 38 different chisels to carve the rosette medallions in the replacement moldings. To determine the design for these and the 12 hand-carved pilasters, Mr. Jones consulted, as no doubt Buckland himself did, drawings in Abraham Swan's 1745 ''The British Architect,'' a bible of interior design that was in every colonial gentleman's library. In Washington, curators of the 1800 Octagon House are gradually changing its character after researching period documents. New colors are being introduced and almost 30 layers of old paint are being removed from the rosette and bellflower com position work in the entrance hall. During a structural restoration in the 1960's, according to its curator, Nancy Davis, the entrance hall was painted buff with gray trim, Now painted verdigris with stone-white crown molding, chair rails and door surrounds, the hall presents the same look it must have had when Dolley Madison and the President took refuge there in 1814, after the White House burned. Mindful of future days when technological advances may reveal additional information, several curators of historic houses are leaving small areas untouched: a patch of wall in a drawing room, a bedroom baseboard molding or a string of rosettes on a fireplace surround. In the 1804 George Read II House, which is in the Colonial town of New Castle, Del., the curators are rerestoring most of the rooms with Federal furniture examples recorded in the l836 estate inventory. However, they decided to keep the dining room, restored by private owners in the 1920's, in its opulent Colonial Revival state as an example of the once-popular style. Since traditional pigments used in rerestorations will change as rapidly as they did in the 18th century, a question facing curators of historic houses is how frequently should walls be repainted for historical accuracy. In the meantime, homeowners who wish to keep up with the Colonial look, marketed by the sole distributors of the Williamsburg paint colors, the Martin Senour Paint Company, will want to know that ''Palace Dining Room Gray'' has been replaced on the paint card by ''Palace Dining Room Pearl-Blue.''"
The New York Times, Greece Finds New Site For Statue of Truman," The Greek Government said Tuesday that a statue of Harry S. Truman, blown off its pedestal by a bomb in March, had been repaired and would be re-erected next month. But the 12-foot bronze statue will be placed in the courtyard of the Athens War Museum, and not in the downtown square where it had stood, the Interior Ministry said. President Truman's memory is a vivid symbol here because of the help he sent to anti-Communist forces in the civil war of the late 1940's. The leftist-dominated Athens City Council had voted against the restoration of the statue, which was damaged before an official visit by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Conservative council members accused the leftists of essentially condoning the bomb attack. After complaints from the conservative opposition and from Greek-Americans, who had provided the money to put up the statue in the early 1960's, the Socialist Government said it was repairing the damage and was looking for a spot for its relocation. It apparently decided to resolve the issue quickly after Greek-American organizations announced that they were arriving here in March to erect the statue in a formal ceremony."
The New York Times, GOLIC IS STRONG POINT FOR BROWNS," Bob Golic, the Cleveland Browns' nose tackle, is one of those athletes who was given a second chance in the National Football League and made the most of it. Steroids weren't involved in the quick makeover of Golic from the 235-pound linebacker let go by the New England Patriots to the 270-pound nose tackle voted to the Pro Bowl squad the past two seasons. But steroids were thought about when Golic, who is from Cleveland, joined the Browns on a waiver claim in 1982 and was told he would now play nose tackle. It is a position he has described as ''de-evolution.'' ''I went from a two-legged, walking, upright, thinking human being to a four-legged, crawling, sniveling beast of burden,'' he said. ''The opposite of Darwin's theory.'' Power-Lifting Helped Golic at the time asked the strength coach, Dave Redding, ''Shall I take something?'' Redding said he would not condone steroids, so Golic suggested instead a diet of ''Twinkies and a lot of beer.'' Redding, however, introduced him to his first intense power-lifting program and his playing weight went from 235 to 255 and on to 270. Said Golic today, as the Browns finished three days of practice here at Dodgertown for their playoff game Saturday against the Jets, ''I'm comfortable at 270, half quickness, half ballast.'' The 29-year-old Notre Dame alumnus has many opinions - including some about steroids. ''I hope they do start getting some kind of steroid testing,'' he said. ''It would make my job a lot easier. There are guys around the league that you know are using something because there is no way they could look like that. They look like somebody pumped them up with an air hose.'' 'A Matter of Pride' If the ban on steroids was followed in the N.F.L., Golic said, ''There would be a lot of offensive linemen playing indoor soccer next year. They'd look like raisins. ''Obviously, the people who are doing the steroids have a mentality that is wrong because they are trying to push themselves past a point that is natural for them. ''I look at it as a matter of pride. If I took steroids, and I got big and I got strong and I got fast and I went out and I made the Pro Bowl, I might be happy. ''But I would also know that is wasn't me. It wasn't natural. I had to do something unnatural to get there. That would be hard to accept, but of course there are guys who can. They got there and that's all that matters.'' With the Browns, Golic has come a long way. He started as a nose tackle for the first time against the Los Angeles Raiders in the 1982 playoffs and soon met Gene Upshaw, the 6-foot-6, 275-pound guard who is now director of the players' union. Golic called for a pass-rush switch that had him looping around from the outside. ''I come around the corner and I think, 'Hey, this is going to be easy.' '' he said. ''But Upshaw's standing back there. It looks like he's been waiting a week, waiting for me. ''I think about all these moves I'm going to make on him. I put my head down and drive into his chest. He didn't move. I immediately went from a 6-3 to a 6-2 nose tackle.'' Golic improved quickly, and by the end of the 1983 season he was voted a Pro Bowl alternate. This season was another good one but it lacked one element. ''I didn't get any quarterback sacks,'' said Golic. ''I had my hand on the guy a few times and I told the coaches to give me at least a half-sack. No. ''One of our guys said, 'If you'd had just one sack you might have been defensive player of the year.' '' Golic is good enough so that opponents see to it that he is blocked at least twice and sometimes three times. ''I get hit from all directions,'' he said. ''That's my job.'' Golic likes his head coach, Marty Schottenheimer, because of his enthusiasm. ''As you get farther along in the game,'' he said, ''you have a tendency sometimes to look at it as a business, go to the office, do your job, go home, get the paycheck. ''Being a Notre Dame guy, I'm into the rah-rah, let's get fired up. Marty brings an emotionalism to the game. ''It's not the screaming and yelling which he does sometimes. You can see him when he's talking, the muscles in the jaw tighten, the eyes get a little wet. You can see the emotion there. This game means everything. That gets me going. And there's a bunch of other guys who feel the same way.''  N.F.L. PLAYOFFS"
The New York Times, Books of The Times; Voice From the Theater," WRITING IN RESTAURANTS. By David Mamet. 160 pages. Viking. $15.95. It was as a child in a Chicago schoolyard that David Mamet first recognized words as ''magical and powerful unto themselves,'' whether used for insult, imprecation, arbitration or, as is the case with the adult Mamet, for dramatic poetry. On the strength of his theatrical body of work, plays that include ''American Buffalo'' and the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' Mr. Mamet has become one of our most astute and distinctive playwrights. That he is also a fine essayist is a fact that, until now, has been something of a secret. His new book, ''Writing in Restaurants,'' is a collection of articles, speeches, commentaries and introductions to plays, some of which may have been written in restaurants. But there is nothing random about the anthology (and there are no gravy stains on his ideas). Although the pieces deal with such diverse subjects as play-writing, poker, pool halls and family vacations, there is a unifying thread. Above all, Mr. Mamet is a moralist, a man who is dedicated to differentiating truth from trash. Often he returns to Stanislavsky, holding him up as a humanist and a figure of artistic probity. On occasion, the Russian director shares stage space with an ancient seer or a bit of folk wisdom, as in this observation: ''There is a homily popularly attributed to the Chinese to the effect that the time one spends fishing is not deducted from one's life span. This may or may not be true of fishing . . . but it is certainly not true of the theater. The time one spends in a theater - whether as spectator or as worker - is deducted from one's total allotment, and this is what Stanislavsky had in mind when he said, 'Play well, or play badly, but play truly.' '' From Mr. Mamet's perspective, the Philistines have all but destroyed his favored profession. Production, meaning overproduction, has been ''the death of the American theater'' - one reason he continues to find a theatrical sanctuary in writing radio plays. Broadway has priced itself out of presenting new plays; it now costs $750,000 to put on a three-character, one-set drama. Broadening the attack, he adds about the movies, his other major livelihood, ''They aren't administered by Miss Dove, but by people interested solely in making a buck on the buck they have put out.'' The problem, of course, is not simply financial. He sees an instability in the theatrical life of such huge proportion that it supports Camus's comparison of the actor to Sisyphus. While Mr. Mamet and his colleagues push their boulders up the mountain, lurking on the other side are the critics in ambush. Surprisingly, considering his outspoken public statements on the subject, in print he seems to have tempered his hostility. In a speech to theater critics, he advises them to ''write for yourself, and be an artist'' rather than a ''weather vane and reporter to the public taste'' - and tells them how to do it. He is as demanding on the playwright, on himself as playwright, as he is on actors and critics. ''Every time the author leaves in a piece of nonessential prose (beautiful though it may be),'' he writes, ''he weakens the structure of the play.'' It is at least partly as an act of self-criticism for him to state that it is ''much easier to write great dialogue'' than it is ''to write great plots'' - although one must add that there is far more in Mr. Mamet's art than meets the ear. At the same time, still a schoolyard lawyer, he sees the theater as a court of last resort. A play, by his measure, ''is a strict lesson in ethics,'' a definition that finds support in Mr. Mamet's own plays. The Mamet Bureau of Standards and Practices also operates in the world outside the theater. He describes the frustration he felt when he tried to tell a bank teller that she had accidently given him $2,500 after he had deposited a check for that amount (no thanks in banks). His poker passion is detailed (in 20 years of playing he has seen very few poor losers but many poor winners). And he reports, with amazement, that a friend wanted to design a down-filled Hawaiian shirt. A few of the pieces seem peripheral, and one dealing with ''The Cherry Orchard'' leaves some question as to how much he really admires the play. But the author's batting average as a wordsmith is exceedingly high. In this book, Mr. Mamet acts as a teacher, critic and 20th-century transcendalist, resolutely idealistic as he tries to - to use a favorite Mamet word -inculcate awareness. Even dealing with relatively minor matters he can have acute insights, as in his observation that ''only two legitimate national holidays remain,'' times when ''we, as a People, are united'' - the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards. One fantastic story, that of reprisals suffered at the hands of the Dead Man's Lot gang (too long to tell; see page 53), is an object lesson in the limits of altruism. In his Harvard lecture on the subject of ''Decay,'' in and out of the theater, he indicates that identifying a problem does not absolve one of responsibility. ''We are the problem,'' he says, ''like the man driving home from the Hamptons on Sunday night and cursing the idiots who have caused the traffic jam.''"

The New York Times, PLASTER CASTS OF STATUES: FROM STORAGE INTO VOGUE," The vast warehouse storage room is wall-to-wall with plaster replicas of the great sculpture of the Western world - by Michelangelo, Praxiteles and hundreds of others. But the statues stand in crowded rows, their faces chipped and cracked and black with the accumulated grime of decades. Disembodied heads are found by the boxful, and many figures have no lower limbs. It is the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of plaster casts -once among the museum's most highly prized treasures but until just a few years ago ignored and crumbling in a leaky storehouse under the West Side Highway in upper Manhattan. Recently, however, the casts have benefited from a renaissance of interest among scholars, who increasingly find them worthy of study, restoration and exhibition. Riding this wave of renewed interest, the Met was able last year to transfer the collection to a storage warehouse in the Bronx, and has lent hundreds of the works to museums and universities nationwide. ''We tried for years, with limited resources and different priorities, to have them restored and placed in academies and schools, but there were no takers,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum. ''There is no question there was a period of time when there was less interest than at other times. But with this resurgence of interest, we were able to gather up the resources to cope with them. I'd love to see more of them restored and put on loan.'' A center for the renewed interest in the casts is the Queens Museum, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. In the mid 1970's, the museum began to restore some of the Met's damaged casts, and today it runs a conservation laboratory exclusively for that purpose. In return for conserving the works, the Queens Museum is granted the right to borrow them on long-term loan. Permanent Exhibition Last April, the Queens Museum opened a permanent exhibition of 22 of the restored plaster casts, including those of the Venus de Milo, the Belvedere Torso and eight sculptures by Michelangelo, including the Florentine Pieta, the Dawn and Dusk figures from the Medici Chapel and the Dying Slave. ''We're looking at a real revolution in taste,'' said Janet Schneider, the director of the Queens Museum. ''After World War II, modern artists were seeking to negate the dominant Western classical tradition, and casts were a symbol of that tradition. Many of them were destroyed. But now, in 1986, there's a whole new generation of artists who never saw a cast. They've been away so long they begin to look new.'' Among the other institutions that have borrowed plaster casts from the Metropolitan Museum are Princeton University, Carnegie Mellon University and the New York Academy of Art, a school in Manhattan that uses a curriculum based on Renaissance and Beaux-Arts principles. The new interest in plaster casts, most experts agree, is yet another expression of ''post-modern'' taste, which extends beyond pure abstract art to an interest in a variety of historical styles, ranging from figurative and expressionist art to the architectural use of classical figures and decorations. Originally, plaster casts were the most prized holdings of major American museums, which in the 19th century collected them in the belief that masterpieces of European classical art and architecture would never be available - or affordable. Casting Teams In the late 19th century, the great museums of Europe, such as the Louvre and the British Museum, made casts of the original works in their collections to sell to American museums and collectors; at other times, American museums commissioned teams of craftsmen to make casts from the originals. In the early 20th century, however, as American fortunes grew and many in Europe dwindled, masterpieces began to flow to the west. A taste for originals came to dominate, and casts were put in storage or destroyed en masse until, by the 1940's, virtually none were on view. The fragility of the plaster casts made their storage perilous, and the Met's collection was no exception. In the 158th Street storehouse, the sculptures were often piled atop one another. Wind, leaky roofs and vibrations from traffic all took their toll. The turnabout began around 1975, when the Queens Museum requested, and received, the loan of several casts from the Met. In return, the smaller museum agreed to restore the works, and a conservation studio was formed for that purpose. The restoration project stalled in the late 70's for lack of funds but was revived in 1983 with a $150,000 grant from the Chase Manhattan Bank. In June 1985, with the encouragement of Mayor Koch, $100,000 in city funds were allocated to the restoration program, and later that year, as part of a highway construction project, the city paid for the transportation of the casts from the West Side Highway site to the Bronx. Multiprocess Cleaning Today, the Queens Museum conservation laboratory is working on more than 350 borrowed casts. A team of four can take up to a month on a major piece, at an average cost of between $10,000 and $20,000. The process involves soaking the surface with a mild solvent, gently scraping off the dirt, then painting and polishing the statue. According to Ms. Schneider, the casts are not without their detractors - ''many people still consider them duller than death'' - but their assets outweigh their limitations. She said that since many of the casts, such as those of the Parthenon frieze, were made before pollution decayed the original works, they actually showed far more detail than the current originals. The casts have proved popular with many artists. George Segal, the contemporary sculptor who works in roughly modeled plaster, recently visited the plaster-cast replicas of Michelangelo's Medici Chapel sculptures at the New York Academy of Art. ''Nobody stops you when you run your hand over the musculature,'' said Mr. Segal. ''One of the primary experiences of being a sculptor is physical tangibility, being able to see and touch. I thought it was magnificent to encounter a Michelangelo cast that way. These experiences are remarkably rich.''"
The New York Times, A MAN'S CASTLE IS HIS HOME," THIRTEEN months ago, just as I despaired of finding a retreat to which I could retire from a world gone mad with materialism, I spotted a magazine real-estate ad for a castle in Tuscany with 365 rooms. ''At last,'' I told my wife, ''here's our pied-a-terre.'' She said, ''Imagine spending time in a different room every day of the year!'' Since the alternative, a studio apartment at Lincoln Center with an eat-in closet, cost the same $16.4 million, we bought the castle. ''The kitchen is original,'' said the broker when we arrived last Jan. 1. ''It dates to 1300, when the Medicis moved in - they had first refusal -so it needs a little work.'' After inspecting the ancient kitchen layout -nine pantries, buttery, butchery, bakery, silver vault, salad bar and takeout counter - we agreed, and installed a hot plate in the baronial winter dining room next to the three-ox spit. My wife wanted one in the summer dining room, too, but I said two hot plates were a waste of money. In the glassed-in cloister, we studied the kitchen garden, with its Asti spumante fountains watering tortellini bushes, and rows of cannelloni alla toscana around a minestrone pond where some prosciutto grazed peacefully. The broker told us, ''In the year 800, Charlemagne lived in this fortification, just after it was built.'' That night, I encountered Charlemagne's ghost on the loggia. He said, ''I've walked these halls for 1,172 winters, so maybe I can give you a household tip.'' I said, ''What is it?'' He said, ''Get central heating fast.'' A week later, after touring all 365 rooms, I felt we needed a finished basement. My wife wondered what for. I said, ''Just a conversation piece.'' So we furnished the game room with a stadium-size gridiron and a canasta table in case my aunt from Mamaroneck visited. When my wife, joking, asked how we could afford such palatial splendor, I said, ''We'll do what the leftover English aristocracy does to rescue country houses - put in a restaurant.'' Pointing to the castle's crenelated facade, I explained, ''Above that 14th-century clock, next to the Bernini angel, we'll hang a neon sign that flashes 'Eats.' '' Life hit a low point when the restaurant's custom dinner service displaying our coat of arms in gold arrived from Limoges. I checked the motto and found a typographical error: ''Don't Thread on Me.'' Business aside, our No. 1 problem was the 299 bedrooms - and no bathrooms. We bought a rollaway bed and dressers on casters so they could be moved from bedroom to bedroom every day. Each morning, we are carried down two flights on a sedan chair to the bath in the knights' hall; this is hard on the help, because we have only one upstairs servant. We were embarrassed at our first banquet. It is somewhat inconvenient for early-departing guests when 250 coats are piled on one bed, especially when three drinks make you forget where the bed is that day. Since then, guests have entered through the armory, where there are 500 antlers, and hang up their own: moose for men's coats, deer for women's. At breakfast one day, my wife clicked on the microphone at her end of the refectory table and said, ''What should we do with the empty 400-foot by 600-foot Grand Salon?'' I was baffled: ''Which room is that?'' She answered in a flash: ''That three-story one with the pediments carved by Norman artisans resting on mock-Corinthian capitals above Carrara marble pilasters. The one with the Gothic vaulting in Moorish domes in the manner of Bramante. The one with trompe l'oeil bas reliefs offsetting Flemish black-and-white checkerboard paving edged by arabesques.'' ''Oh,'' I said. ''That one. Let's make it the den.'' We cut the travel between the castle's east and west wings to 15 minutes by installing two one-car IRT trains, built to scale. The system, under the picture gallery, works well, although the express often arrives on the local track. Of course, we never use it at night. We modernized the throne room's bell pull. One yank of the ceiling-high brocade sash still brings the falconer, and two yanks, the scribe; but three gets us the computer repairman; four, the sommelier with Chianti, and five, a delivery of ''pizza everything'' (five and a half means ''hold the pepperoni''). The dungeon was impossible; we couldn't do a thing with it except hang dehumidifers from the manacles. Our moat is a godsend. Each night after we park we hoist the drawbridge; the car radio has never been stolen again. Actually, there are two moats - fresh and salt water - one stocked with carp (we sell to the Chinese restaurants in Montepulciano), the other with maatjes herring (for our Sunday mornings). By the eighth month, homesick for apartment-house ways, we hired a superintendent - fully expecting him to ignore crucial repairs. (He does.) Should we have moved to Lincoln Center? No. Our mahogany-paneled library has become the entertainment center. From speakers under El Greco's pastel idylls of prancing nymphs, music flows: Gregorian chants, Fats Waller singing ''Ain't Misbehavin'.'' Wearing smoking jacket and bunny slippers, I watch the giant TV screen that drops over the self-portrait Czar Nicholas II gave my grandfather as an emigration gift. In the last 365 days, we've had problems: criticism of our new mural over the grand staircase, ''The Mets' Gary Carter Traps a Pop Fly at the Visitors' Dugout''; the $5,000 Windex bill for the Hall of Mirrors, and landscaping cost overruns for the 400 acres of Astroturf. The road to Florence lies beyond the sequoias we imported from California, our private zoo's lion pit (which frightens the postman) and a replica of the Triborough Bridge we erected over a sweet brook. ''We need a mailbox,'' I said. ''How about japanned tin mounted on two plaster griffins with acanthus-leaf wings? They can spray green water skyward whenever we get a bank statement.'' ''It's a bad idea,'' my wife said. ''The neighbors might think we're nouveaux riches.''"
The New York Times, Poland Cites Debt Problem," Poland will be unable to meet interest repayments to Western creditors next year and its hard currency debt is expected to reach more than $35 billion, according to official statistics published today. An economic plan for 1987 cited by the official P.A.P. press agency sees a trade surplus with the West of $1 billion, virtually unchanged from this year. The revenues are needed primarily to service the debt, but the agency said that ''Poland will continue to lack enough currency to fully pay interest on foreign debt, which means that full indebtedness will grow to more than $35 billion.'' Poland has fallen behind in paying interest due for at least two years, and negotiations with the Paris Club of 17 Western creditor nations on rescheduling 1986 repayments have failed to reach agreement. Finance Minister Bazyli Samojlik told reporters recently that Poland would repay less than $2 billion in 1986, but would not disclose how much needed to be rescheduled. Diplomats estimate that $550 million could be lacking, a similar amount to 1985. Mr. Samojlik said Poland's debt was likely to reach $33.4 billion by the end of 1986."
The New York Times, Allied Stores Takeover Cleared," The Allied Stores Corporation's shareholders have approved the $3.5 billion acquisition of the big New York-based retailer by the Campeau Corporation. Toronto-based Campeau's takeover plan specified that each share of Allied common stock that Campeau does not already own will be converted into $69 in cash if the takeover was completed by yesterday. Campeau, one of Canada's biggest real estate developers, already owned 27.9 million Allied shares as of yesterday. It had bought 25.8 million shares in a block for $67 a share, for a total price of about $1.73 billion. The price paid for the other 2 million or so shares was not available, a Campeau spokesman said. There were 52.3 million shares of Allied stock outstanding on Dec. 1, so Campeau had some 24.4 million shares left to purchase at the agreed-upon price of $69 apiece, or about $1.68 billion. The acquisition - based on the amounts Campeau has already spent and will spend -will cost about $3.5 billion. COMPANY NEWS"
The New York Times," FURNITURE SALES OFF, KNOLL IS REGROUPING"," HIT by a severe slump in the demand for office furniture, Knoll International, the New York-based designer and manufacturer of modern furniture for offices and homes, is undergoing a restructuring that so far has cost an estimated 200 jobs and prompted the company to buy back the stock it issued less than four years ago in its first public offering. Once a highly specialized company that concentrated on reproducing masterpieces of modern furniture for a select group of customers, Knoll in the last decade has tried to move into the far larger market for mass-produced office systems. As recently as two years ago the office furniture business was expanding by almost 20 percent annually. Lawrence R. Ryan, then Knoll's president and chief executive officer, announced in November 1985 that the company wanted to increase its share of the mass market from about 3 percent to 10 percent. In the past year, however, an oversupply of office space and widespread uncertainty about the economic climate have resulted in a severe cutback in orders for new furniture. ''It used to be a tremendous growth market but it's plateaued,'' said Stanley Lanzet, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Big companies are very stingy in committing orders while they're uneasy about the economy. And office furniture is a highly deferrable item.'' Frederick Marcus, a member of Knoll's board as well as director of financial relations, concurred. ''There has been a real deceleration in orders from corporate America,'' he said. ''The hardest hit have been the large contracts, the new corporate headquarters.'' Mr. Marcus said Knoll's strength had always been with architects and designers. ''We were weakest at the dealer level, working with the everyday, grind-it-out pieces,'' he said. ''It's going to take us two to four years to establish a presence in the dealer community, while our competitors are well entrenched and have been doing it right for 10 to 15 years.'' Steelcase Inc. of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Herman Miller Inc. of Zeeland, Mich., together control some 50 per cent of the large-contract office furniture business. Since the early 70's Knoll has put more and more of its effort and prestige behind a series of office systems, coordinated sets of desks, chairs, filing cabinets, wall panels and shelves designed to accomodate computer hardware and its complex wiring. Mr. Marcus said the company was changing emphasis and many of the people who have left ''were not interested in working with the dealers.'' Among the casualties was Mr. Ryan. ''Larry's talents were optimized when levels of demand kept increasing,'' Mr. Marcus said, ''and his records speak for themselves. He just wasn't familiar with a low-growth environment.'' Most of the staff cuts came in October, said Joyce Clark, a company spokesman. Mel Stuart, who succeeded Mr. Ryan, was president of Knoll International WorldTrade Inc., the company's foreign subsidiary, in a period when the overseas market was a ''low-growth environment,'' Mr. Marcus said. Knoll was founded in 1938 by Hans Knoll, a German immigrant whose family had made furniture in Germany designed by the Bauhaus School. In the years after World War II Mr. Knoll and his wife, Florence, revolutionized office design by popularizing the furniture of Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe and Eero Saarinen. Mr. Knoll died in 1955, and in 1977 Mrs. Knoll sold the company to General Felt Industries of Saddle Brook, N.J. In l983 Knoll raised $45 million in its first public sale of stock, and used much of the money to finance its entry into the mass-produced office systems business. One analyst described the move in 1985 as ''a Cadillac moving down to the Oldsmobile part of the business.'' It is those shares that the company is currently buying back for $12 a share. The current price is about $11.50. The stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, reached a high of $20.38 in the first quarter of 1986. Mr. Marcus said there were roughly 3.23 million shares outstanding, about half of them held by institutions and half by private investors. The tentative expiration date for the buy-back offer is Jan. 15. Mr. Marcus said he expected the offer to be fully subscribed. Mr. Marcus said Knoll decided on the buy-back ''because to protect the core of our employees and the core of our business, we realized we were going to have to make a series of decisions that would have a negative near-term impact on earnings.''"
The New York Times, Pullman Halts Offer to Joy," The Pullman-Peabody Company said today that it had dropped its unsolicited bid to acquire the Joy Manufacturing Company, which has agreed instead to be purchased by an investor group for $35 a share, or $620 million. Pullman-Peabody had started a $31-a-share tender offer for Joy on Dec. 2, and later proposed to sweeten the bid to $34 a share. But Joy rejected both offers as inadequate and accepted the investor group's bid on Dec. 22. Under its agreement with Joy, Pullman-Peabody said it would tender the nearly one million Joy common shares it already owned to the investor group, which was formed by Adler & Shaykin, a New York investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts. The agreement also calls for litigation between the companies to be dropped, and for Joy to pay $750,000 to Pullman-Peabody to help cover Pullman-Peabody's expenses in connection with its failed offer. Pittsburgh-based Joy is a maker of oilfield and petroleum equipment and coal-mining machinery. Pullman-Peabody, based in Princeton, supplies material-handling and food service equipment, and makes components for the aerospace and communications industries. The investor group's tender offer for Joy's stock is due to expire Jan. 26. Joy's stock closed at $34.75 a share today, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange trading. COMPANY NEWS"
The New York Times, Two Countries Raise Oil Prices," Venezuela and Egypt have raised their oil prices by up to $1 a barrel and $1.35 a barrel, respectively. The newspaper El Universal reported in Caracas that the Venezuelan state oil company had raised its prices for Venezuelan crude exports to $14.50 a barrel and for petroleum products to $16 a barrel. It was the third increase of Venezuela's crude oil and fourth for its oil products since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided earlier this month to reduce production and raise prices to an average of $18 a barrel. In Egypt, an oil ministry official said that January prices would go up on all grades of its exported oil by $1.35 a barrel. Egypt is not a member of OPEC but sets its prices according to the world market. The official said the OPEC agreement had improved world market prices, allowing the rise in Egyptian prices. The price of Egypt's top-grade Gulf of Suez blend was increased to $16.60 a barrel."
The New York Times, Accuray Fears Loss Of Egalitarian Style," As president and chief executive, David L. Nelson has fostered an unusual culture at the Accuray Corporation. All employees are called associates and part of their salary is based on an incentive program. Perks for management - even special parking spaces - are out and egalitarianism is in. But employees worry that this could change as two larger companies, Hercules Inc. and Combustion Engineering Inc., bid for the Columbus, Ohio, company. ''It's really a shame to see us going from an independent corporation to a division of a larger company,'' said Glenn Ostel, a company spokesman, ''because it's such a unique company.'' Hercules has said, however, that it will run the company as an independent operation with current management, and Combustion Engineering has said it is seeking the company under terms similar to those offered by Hercules. So there is a chance that Mr. Nelson's innovations will survive under a parent company. On Tuesday, Combustion Engineering raised its offer to $45 a share, or a total of $214 million, compared with a $40-a-share offer from Hercules. Accuray was founded in 1950 and grew from three employees to 2,000 and revenues of $150 million. It makes sophisticated equipment to measure products as they are being made and then controls the production process, improving quality and productivity. The company's main customers make paper, plastics, metals and cigarettes. Mr. Nelson, 55 years old, has been with the company since 1956 and has worked in engineering, sales and administration. He holds a bachelor of science degree from Iowa State University and was a Marine captain from 1952 to 1954. He has been president since 1967 and chief executive since 1970. Mr. Nelson was dealing with the acquisition offers yesterday and unavailable for an interview. Mr. Ostel said Mr. Nelson was popular among employees, and one reason was that he strives to do away with anything ''that smacks of perks or a caste system or anything like that.'' At a senior management meeting, the spokesman said, it came to Mr. Nelson's attention that vice presidents had their own parking places and within an hour the ''reserved'' signs were taken down. Mr. Nelson and the company's No. 2 man, Christopher J. Campbell, 58, executive vice president and chief operating officer, ''have defined the culture of Accuray,'' Mr. Ostel said. ''We really enjoy doing what we do and have the freedom to do it,'' Mr. Ostel said. ''That's why the company is attracting these bids. We're all very flattered.''  BUSINESS PEOPLE"
The New York Times, Long-Term Bond Prices Fall," Government securities dealers spent yesterday's abbreviated session marking down prices of long-term Treasury bonds and raising those on intermediate maturities. As a partial explanation of yesterday's activity, dealers said they were expecting more institutional and other bond investors to shorten the maturities in their portfolios when they start to return to the market next week. The market was also unsettled by bearish economic news: The Government reported a record $19.2 billion trade deficit, and the dollar fell to a new six-year low against the West German mark. Sentiment was not helped by the continued rise in oil prices and the sharp $15-an-ounce surge in gold, which sent bullion prices above the $400 mark once again. Whether or not these factors signal inflation, the bane of bond holders, or are merely short-term phenomena, the bond market took the prudent course of adjusting positions yesterday. As a result, the offered price of the bellwether long Treasury bond, the 7.5 percent issue due in 2016, closed down 17/32, at 100 7/32, for a yield of 7.48 percent, compared with 7.44 percent the previous day. Also at 2 P.M., when trading in government securities ended yesterday, the price of long Treasury notes, such as the 7 1/4 percent issue of 1996, was down 8/32, or a quarter-point, at 100 5/32, and now yields 7.23 percent, compared with 7.20 percent the day before. But the shortening of maturities helped raise the price of the 6 1/4 percent issue of 1988 by 3/32, to 99 28/32, for a yield of 6.32 percent. The 6 5/8 percent issue of 1990 closed unchanged at 99 21/32, a yield of 6.72 percent, and the 7 percent notes of January 1994, which the Treasury auctioned Tuesday at an average yield of 7.09 percent, closed unchanged yesterday at an offered price of 99 18/32. As expected, the end of the quarter and the year caused a last-minute flurry of Treasury bill purchases by corporations, mutual funds and other institutions seeking to show large cash positions on their final accounts for 1986. This traditional ''window-dressing'' helped shave three basis points off the discount rate of 90-day Treasury bills, which closed at 5.68 percent; the six-month bill rate fell four basis points, to 5.64 percent, and the one-year bills closed at 5.63, down nine basis points. Also expected was the abnormally high Federal funds, or overnight interbank lending, rate, which opened at 30 percent and broke sharply to 9 percent just before the 2 P.M. close. Aside from the usual heavy demand for window-dressing and other funds on Dec. 31, yesterday was the end of the two-week bank reserve settlement period, when many banks scramble to meet various reserve requirements. Yesterday was also the settlement day for the $18 billion of notes auctioned by the Treasury last week. Dealers were surprised by the timing of the Fed's intervention in the market, which occurred at 10 A.M, or more than an hour earlier than normal. In any case, the Fed's direct injection of reserves into the banking system, effected by two-day system repurchase agreements, came when the funds rate was 20 percent. The credit market is closed today. Tomorrow, the credit market, which normally has no fixed closing hour, will again end at 2 P.M. CREDIT MARKETS"
The New York Times, ARTS GROUPS SEEK ETHNICALLY BROADER AUDIENCE," As the ethnic composition of New York City changes with the arrival of Hispanic, black and Asian immigrants, local arts organizations are beginning to try to reach out to new audiences. The New York State Council on the Arts, for example, has just announced a pilot project to try to diversify the ethnic composition of audiences of cultural institutions by the year 2000 to reflect the changes in the composition of the state's population. ''Since 1965, New York State has witnessed dramatic population shifts resulting from new immigrants,'' said Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairman of the council. ''Nearly one in three New Yorkers is a recent immigrant to the country. The greatest number of our newest citizens come from the Caribbean, Latin America and Southeast Asia, but these numbers are not reflected in the audiences of New York's cultural institutions and we believe this should change.'' The council will distribute $243,288 to nine institutions to start outreach programs that could become models for other organizations. The institutions in New York City are Ballet Hispanico, Museum of the City of New York, the New York Philharmonic, the Queens Symphony Orchestra and the Studio Museum of Harlem. Also awarded grants were the Albany Institute of History and Arts, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Metropolitan School for the Arts in Onondaga County and the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra. The projects include discussions and seminars, hiring marketing and promotion experts, offering reduced ticket prices at performances, creating new multicultural events to attract a more diverse audience and scheduling concerts in upstate New York in communities that would not otherwise have them. $1.5 Million Being Sought Mrs. Hart said the council was asking the State Legislature for $1.5 million next year to expand the project to include other institutions throughout the state. She said that the council, through this project, recognized that cultural organizations needed the patronage and appreciation of the public and that the public needed the institutions as well. Tucker Ashworth, a spokesman for the City Planning Department, said the city's non-Hispanic white population declined from 63 percent of the total population in the 1970 census to 51.9 percent in the 1980 census. But according to a recent analysis of population samples by John D. Kasarda, chairman of the sociology department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, blacks, Hispanics and Asians already constitute a majority of city residents. Edward Kresky, vice chairman of the council, who with Mrs. Hart and others helped start the council's pilot project, said recent articles in The New York Times about New York City's changing population had been the catalyst for the effort. Mr. Kresky, who held a symposium on audience diversification last spring at New York University, said: ''We have ethnic groups that are entirely new, and the percentage of our population aged 60 and over has vastly increased. In our symphony halls in the state we have an audience that is primarily white and is older than I recall when I was a young concertgoer. Our museums have to reach out more into ethnic arts than they have in the past. There has to be more of a move into the community and back and forth.'' ''It's very important that the arts council break some new ground in this area,'' he said. ''We have had a great growth in numbers of institutions. We need equal growth in the numbers of audiences if the organizations are going to survive. Some of the people we're seeking to reach have never had the experience of taking their children to concerts or museums. There are economic hurdles, but if they'll go and feel comfortable with things they are attunded to ethnically, hopefully they will broaden their interests into others areas.'' Concerts in Harlem The New York Philharmonic, which received a $30,000 grant, began its community outreach program seven years ago with concerts at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and will continue with concerts, seminars and discussions in Harlem and other communities. Such programs occasionally run into snags when politics and the arts mix. Last month, more than a third of the New York Philharmonic refused to play at a free concert at the church because one of its ministers, a supporter of the Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan, would not denounce anti-Semitic statements Mr. Farrakhan made last year. The concert took place anyway. The next New York Philharmonic concert in Harlem will be Jan. 5, 1988, at the renovated Apollo Theater and will be conducted by Zubin Mehta, according to Daniel J. Windham, director of educational activities at the Philharmonic. The move to the Apollo was not related to the incident at the church, Mr. Windham said, but reflected the intention of the Philharmonic to try to reach a larger Harlem audience. ''It's a part of our mandate and policy to be a cultural institution for all of the city and its inhabitants,'' Mr. Windham said. ''Historically, people have not come, perhaps because it's unfamiliar territory or they may have felt they were not wanted. Those perceptions are pretty longstanding, and it's up to the institution to try to break down those barriers.'' A Sense of Proprietorship Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, executive director of the Studio Museum of Harlem, which received a $45,000 grant for its program to develop new audiences, said some people forget the pluralistic nature of society and the need to try to include its many different facets in cultural life. ''One of the reasons minorities don't participate as much is that they don't have a sense of cultural proprietorship at the traditional institutions,'' Dr. Campbell said. ''Blacks, Hispanics and Asians have rich cultural traditions. They are all very complex. There is a real need for them to be able to have a sense of ownership over their own culture and own cultural prerogatives. They are not permitted to at a lot of mainstream cultural institutions.'' ''An institution is a place that has to have a role for people, people to be volunteers, to come to events, to help run the institutions so that they become their home, their places,'' she continued. ''If traditional institutions are going to be successful, they have to begin to involve minority population in ways to make them feel truly part of the institution, not just as an audience. Anything is possible with imaginative leadership, and that's just what it will take.''"
The New York Times," IN DESIGN TRENDS, A GLANCE BACK AND HINTS OF '87"," IN the opening scene of the movie ''Ruthless People,'' Sam Stone, played by Danny DeVito, plots the death of his wife, Barbara (Bette Midler), an obstreperous Beverly Hills matron. ''God I hate that woman,'' he rants. ''I hate the way she licks stamps. I hate her furniture!'' ''I hate her furniture!'' may be the most telling line of 1986. The furniture in question was in the Italian avant-garde Memphis style, and Mr. DeVito's character may have been speaking for many when he uttered this impassioned critique of Italian 'nuovo' design. That Memphis furniture wound up as a comic device in a Hollywood movie says a lot about the year 1986. There were no Italian gurus creating never-before-seen furniture forms, no one all-embracing movement like post-modernism to hang stylistic hats upon. Instead, 1986 was a year in which comfort, expressed through the use of natural materials and in furniture that was rarely outrageous, took center stage. It was a year in which Witold Rybczynski, a Canadian architect, wrote ''Home: A Short History of an Idea,'' a cultural inquiry into comfort. The book confirmed the reactions of Danny DeVito's Sam Stone, a design victim if ever there was one. Bill Stumpf, a Minneapolis furniture designer, says ''Home'' is about the major design issue of the 80's, adding, ''A broader sense of physical comfort is something we've denied for many years.'' Among designers themselves, 1986 may be ultimately remembered as the year in which the profession lost two of its leading lights, George Nelson and Raymond Loewy. Mr. Loewy's streamlined forms optimistically expressed the spirit of the machine age. An expert at packaging images, including his own, he predated the current cult of personality and may have been America's first designer superstar. George Nelson, in addition to being a furniture designer, was an irascible critic who suffered fools poorly and was fond of saying, ''We live in a society saturated with visual illiterates.'' Their deaths were a major loss. But many of their concerns live on in a feast of books and exhibitions that celebrate design - not as a profession dedicated to making designer teakettles, but as the stuff of daily life, past and present. At the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, ''Milestones: 50 Years of Goods and Services'' cast its eye on 50 important everyday artifacts, from power mowers to air-conditioners. In his book ''Populuxe,'' Thomas Hine fondly examined the ebullience of the 1950's and the early 60's, from the Miami Beach hotel architect Morris Lapidus to the ridged potato chip. At the Brooklyn Museum, a major exhibition, ''The Machine Age in America 1918-1941'' celebrates the heyday of futuristic streamlined design. The amount of time it takes for anything historical to undergo a revival seems to be shrinking every year. Though the 1950's, 40's, 30's and even the 60's continued to be trendy, above all 1986 was the year of ''Vienna 1900,'' and Josef Hoffmann became firmly established as an icon. In addition to the ''Vienna 1900'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, new reproductions and knockoffs of ''W.W.'' (for Wiener Werkstatte) abounded. At the Metropolitan Museum, ''In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Esthetic Movement'' unveils the not-so-distant treasures of the American esthetic movement. There were more reproductions of Frank Lloyd Wright. In a rather sobering commentary on the historic preservation movement, the antiques dealer Margot Johnson predicted that architectural elements from lost buildings by Louis Sullivan and by Frank Lloyd Wright will be among next year's hot design collectibles. At the designer show houses, those faithful bastions of decorating luxury, opulence was the operative word. It reached its peak, perhaps, at the Southampton designer show house, where decorators went into a fringe frenzy - one room featuring an improbable 82 yards of fringe. The use of chintz, while it will always be with us, may have crested for now, as might faux finishes. Last year, design formality was found in the use of rich fabrics such as silks, satins, heavy velvets, jacquards. Some window treatments were so wavy they made one yearn for Dramamine. Outside, there was a wealth of status garden furniture, especially the English teak bench and a proliferation of the British perennial flower border. Gardening continued to be the subject of probing cocktail conservation such as ''Are your hemerocallis blooming a week earlier this year?'' Outside and in, the look was rich, ''the richer the better,'' in the words of the decorator Mario Buatta, who added, ''Houses are becoming imitative of King Ludwig of Bavaria.'' If there was a bridge between old money and the masses, it was to be found in the home furnishings of Ralph Lauren. From his new Polo shop on Madison Avenue, Mr. Lauren purveys the image of the mythical comforts of home - an image of people sipping Sherry on a squishy sofa beside a roaring fire, beagles at hand. His influence could be found at the Southern Furniture Market in High Point, N.C., last fall, where new designs were old-looking, comfortable and above all nonthreatening: chaises, daybeds, sprawling oversized chairs - lots of stripped pine and wicker. Mr. Lauren creates a personal vision of comfort. In 1986 industrial designers, too, wrestled with the idea of comfort, in not-so-rarefied products. Cousins Design in New York, for example, introduced kitchen ovens for Thermador that featured ''friendly'' squishy polyurethane knobs and handles. The Sharp Corporation continued to inject comforting elements into its products - whimsical pink microwave ovens and curvaceous sea-foam green radios. Though 1986 was not a year for pervasive trends, new directions could be detected, particularly in the expressive use of materials. The new year should see continued use of patinaed metal, wrought iron, galvanized steel, oxidized copper and the deliberate use of distressed surfaces to express age and romance. ''The machine ethic did not allow imperfection,'' notes the designer John Saladino, remarking on the preponderance of fake water stains and mottled textures. Some see an inexorable swing of the pendulum - a return to materials left in their natural state, a sort of design equivalent of health food. The new offices of the designers Massimo and Lella Vignelli, for example, sport waxed lead walls, sandblasted glass panes and a raw steel table. At the restaurant Coastal, to open later this year, the designer Sam Lopata - the man known for his use of tile and mirror and the phrase ''noise is theater'' - will be using simple natural materials, including wood chairs and unvarnished floors. At the very least, the use of natural materials seemed to signal a new communion among design, craft and art. According to Massimo Vignelli, contemporary artists like Richard Serra and Donald Judd have been influential in their pioneering use of materials. Designers' inspiration now ''comes from the arts rather than other designers,'' he said. At Zona, a Santa Fe-style store in SoHo, the natural look reaches some sort of apogee as urbanites pull up in Saabs and Mercedeses to buy birch-bark and willow Ojibwa baskets, forged iron candlesticks and shapely bundles of twigs. As in years past, 1987 should also see the proliferation of the so-called ''design object.'' Following in the footsteps of the Tizio lamp, next year's most sought-after status symbol may very well be the 23-piece, $4,000 Alessi cookware set also designed by Richard Sapper. Seven years in the making, it is a collaboration between Mr. Sapper and six of the world's most illustrious chefs. It is a state-of-the-art design not likely to be used by Mr. Sapper. ''Cook?'' he asks. ''All I can do is brew tea, boil an egg and grill steak.''"

The New York Times, POPE NAMES CALIFORNIA BISHOP," Pope John Paul II has named Bishop Norman F. McFarland of Nevada as the new Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. Bishop McFarland, 64 years old, who has headed the Reno-Las Vegas Diocese for 10 years, succeeds Bishop William R. Johnson, who died July 28. He was the first Bishop of Orange, the second-largest diocese in California, serving 500,000 Catholics. The Pope also named three Auxiliary Bishops for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on Monday. They are the Rev. Patrick Ziemann, 45, of Los Angeles; the Rev. Armando Ochoa, 43, of Los Angeles, and the Rev. P. Carl Fisher, 41, of Baltimore. Father Fisher's appointment makes him the first black Bishop in the Western United States. Archbishop Roger Mahony said he had asked the Pope to appoint a black Auxiliary Bishop ''because Los Angeles has the third-highest overall black population among all the dioceses and archdioceses of the United States.'' The archdiocese estimates that a million blacks live in its boundaries, about 50,000 of them Catholic."
The New York Times, GOING OUT GUIDE," TAKING IT EASY New Year's Day has always had a special tranquillity. Whether the eve was one of unrestrained indulgence or prayerful participation in a watch-night service, something in between or a combination thereof, the day allows for leisure and for genuine sociability. In fact, being sociable on New Year's Day is a tradition. And at the Old Merchants House the tradition is annually upheld with a ''Social Calling in Old New York'' observance. Between 1 and 6 P.M. today the public is invited to visit this 155-year-old building at 29 West Fourth Street. This was the home of the Seabury Tredwell family from 1835 to 1935; his mother was a descendant of Priscilla Mullins and John Alden, of Mayflower fame. In a 10-year task that ended in 1980, the house was restored. Significantly, the original house is all there. There are ancient chandeliers whose light was fueled by whale oil. There is the silver, china, glass, fans, pressed flowers, gowns and other family possessions. For today's open house music will be provided and volunteers and directors will serve refreshments. Admission is $5. Information: 777-1089. 20 CENTS APIECE The 20-year-old Poetry Project's 13th annual New Year's Day benefit is a shoo-in to attract the region's poets. This yearly feast of verse will present 50 poets, performers, dancers, musicians and assorted theatrical people. Their program will begin at 7 P.M. and continue to midnight. The masters of ceremonies are Haoui Montaug of the No Entiendes Cabaret, Two Girls Two (Adele O'Dae and Sybil St. Claire), Carmelita Tropicana and the poets Richard Bandanza and Jessica Hagedorn. The cast will include Allen Ginsberg, Emily XYZ, Anne Waldman, Brad Gooch, Eileen Myles, Bob Holman, Paul Schmidt, Pat Downey, Ray Povod, Pedro Pietri, Maureen Owen, Barbara Barg, Andrei Codrescu, John Giorno, Patricia Jones, Lynne Tillman and Cookie Mueller - all poets and writers. The performers' lineup is scheduled to include Robbie McCauley and Ed Montgomery, the Downtown Divas (Ms. Hagedorn, Deborah Artman and Laurie Carlos), Mary Shultz, Chazz Dean and James Siena, David Cale, Ralph Lemon and Tony Whitfield, Richard Elovich, The Wow Cafe, Nicky Paraiso, Harry Mann and Jim Neu, the Larry Rivers Band, Joseph Jarman and the dancers Yvonne Meier and Yoshiko Chuma. For all 50 the price is $10, which comes to 20 cents apiece. Food and drink will be served. The project's full name is the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, and that's where this performance will take place - at Second Avenue and 10th Street. Information: 674-0910. HERBIE HANCOCK QUARTET For those who have arrived at this point not satiated by the nightclub environment and who want to hear music, tonight may be an ideal time. At the Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, the group is the Herbie Hancock Quartet. Mr. Hancock, the renowned electronic keyboardist, acoustic pianist and performer in the successful movie '' 'Round Midnight,'' is most often seen and heard in large concert halls. Tonight Mr. Hancock, one of the industry's most successful (and busiest) practitioners, is working a nightclub. The quartet's bassist will be Ron Carter, with whom Mr. Hancock has often worked. The two were fixtures in Mr. Hancock's V.S.O.P., the 1970's quartet that also included Wayne Shorter, the tenor saxophonist, and the drummer Tony Williams. For this engagement, the drummer is Al Foster, who, like Mr. Williams, is an exponent of contemporary mainstream drumming. The saxophonist tonight will be Branford Marsalis, formerly associated with Sting. Mr. Hancock was also a presenter of the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, Branford's brother, in Wynton's early phase. Tonight's shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. The quartet may be heard through Saturday night. There is a $35 music charge tonight, a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar. Information and reservations: 475-8592."
The New York Times, MUSIC: LEINSDORF LEADS PHILHARMONIC PROGRAM," The excitement of music for Erich Leinsdorf, who led the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday night, seems to lie more in the understanding, analysis, appreciation of it - as expressed through playing - than in the physical or psychological thrill of performing itself. His appreciation (as one knows it from his lucid books) is not dusty or stern, but many listeners, this one included, find his actual performing style disappointingly cut and dried. One still listens with pleasure, because it is always a pleasure to hear good music confidently handled by someone who understands it and because orchestras tend to play well for Mr. Leinsdorf. Still, Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony did not produce that new experience of wonder that can come with a well-known piece freshly imagined, and the lilt of the shepherds' music from Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' was not so evocative of the biblical scene as it has sometimes seemed. The soloist was Yefim Bronfman, who sat down after intermission to play a pair of substantial ''Fantasies'' for piano and orchestra. One was by the young Debussy, who suppressed its publication with some justification. It contains clear pointers toward the kind of music the composer wanted to write, but he had not yet achieved the economy that would purge his later scores of filler music; here, there is too often a sense of sugary, wandering reiteration of ideas. It's pretty, and (except for some passages near the end when overloud horn playing left the strings and Mr. Bronfman sounding puny) it was well performed. The other work was Liszt's ''Hungarian Fantasy,'' in which Mr. Bronfman had a rousing success. At best, as in the unaccompanied beginning of the fast section and a few of the interspersed cadenzas, he treated the music to an elegant, sparkling play of light and shade. He used dynamics liberally to help in shaping phrases, a procedure apparently obvious but one that many pianists neglect to adopt (especially in concerto work). His soft, fast passage work is not the last word in clarity, but it was a pleasure to hear a Liszt player who realized that this is just as important as hard, fast octaves. Mr. Bronfman provided those, too - again, not so stunningly as to give the thrill of virtuosity but more than well enough to serve a fine musical conception of a piece that can be made to sound trashy. Here it sounded utterly enjoyable, and the audience made its agreement with that sentiment clear. Then came some of the Viennese desserts traditionally favored by the Philharmonic for the New Year's week: ''Bahn frei'' (''Free passage'') by Eduard Strauss and two favorites by brother Johann, with conductor and audience in suitably cheerful spirits."
The New York Times, Dollar Slides Sharply; Gold Surges Past $400," The dollar closed out the year on a sour note yesterday, falling sharply to new six-year lows against the West German mark and other European currencies. Traders sold dollars in response to November's record-shattering trade deficit. Meanwhile, gold prices, which have been flat for the last few sessions, rose by $14.60 an ounce, to $404.90, in a holiday-shortened trading session at the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a final gold bid for the day of $404 a troy ounce, up from $390 Tuesday. The dollar headed into the new year more than 25 percent lower, on average, than at the end of 1985. The American currency fell steadily during 1986, following the September 1985 decision of the major industrial powers to realign currencies in order to reduce the dollar's value and make American exports more competitive. The dollar's decline yesterday was recorded on light trading. But analysts and traders said the slide presaged a further selloff in the new year. ''People thought that the beginning of 1987 would see a renewed push on the dollar,'' sending it lower, said Richard E. Witten, a vice president in foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''But today people were just trying to jump the gun.'' Near the end of the day, the dollar was bid at 1.9190 marks, down 1.5 percent from Tuesday's close. The dollar also reached a new low against the Swiss franc, as it fell to 1.6095 yesterday, down 1 percent from Tuesday. Compared with its performance against European currencies, the dollar's decline against the yen was relatively modest. The yen, which has risen by more than 50 percent against the dollar since the end of 1984, was quoted at 158.19 to the dollar, up slightly from Tuesday's close of 159.95. Trade Figure Comes As Shock Mr. Witten and other traders said that the bulk of the day's activity came within 20 minutes after the November trade figures were announced by the Commerce Department. The $19.2 billion deficit came as a shock; many experts had been expecting a figure in the $14 billion range. ''If the trade number had been in the $14 billion area, the dollar would have been a little stronger,'' Mr. Witten said. ''But when it came out it told traders not to close their books on the dollar yet.'' While a drop in the dollar generally helps gold prices, yesterday's surge was unexpected, according to some analysts. ''Gold has been quiet for the past couple of days, in spite of a falling dollar and rising oil prices,'' said John P. Norris, vice president at Citibank Precious Metals. ''But what happened today came as a little bit of a surprise to most of the trade.'' Mr. Norris said that technical factors, and a delayed reaction in the precious metals markets to the dollar's recent decline, were the main reasons for gold's rise yesterday. The continued fall of the dollar against the German mark prompted the Bundesbank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, to say yesterday that further declines would not be in the best interests of the United States, and could pose risks for economic growth in Germany and throughout Europe. In spite of Mr. Pohl's comments, traders remain convinced that further declines are ahead. ''The emerging trend is that the dollar has to decline more,'' Mr. Witten said, ''say another 5 percent against the mark over the next three months.''  CURRENCY MARKETS"
The New York Times," IRAN ACCUSES U.S. IN TALKS, SAYING ASSET DEAL WAS NEAR"," Iran's chief negotiator accused the United States today of not dealing in ''good faith'' in talks on returning $507.7 million in blocked Iranian assets. The talks were adjourned earlier today, despite an Iranian assertion that a settlement was near. The meeting at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal lasted only 30 minutes, and the United States said this fourth round of talks was at an end. Both sides confirmed, however, that further meetings are planned. Returning to United States At the State Department in Washington, Phyllis Oakley, a spokesman, said, ''The United States negotiators are returning to the United States to consult in preparation for the next meeting. We feel progress was made.'' Mrs. Oakley said no agreement had been expected today and holding more sessions had been seen as ''a likely outcome,'' although she said no date for resumption was set. Assadollah Nouri, the chief Iranian negotiator, said the United States side at The Hague told him no agreement could be reached now because Washington officials were not available over the holiday. He said Iran had expected to conclude the discussions today. At Federal Reserve Bank The $507.7 million represents what is left over, plus interest, in Account No. 1 at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, a $3.66 billion account established with Iranian money in 1981 to pay off syndicated bank loans. The United States delegation ''was supposed to put its final draft for implementation of the award on the table so that we might be able to conclude our negotiations,'' Mr. Nouri said. ''But without any justification, the United States delegation said to us today that it would not be ready to continue the talks,'' he added. Mr. Nouri continued, ''They said that their home authorities are not available at this time of the year in Washington so they could not reach them easily to persuade them to sign a final draft.'' Lack of Faith Charged ''The Government of the United States in implementing the tribunal award has so far not shown its good faith,'' the Iranian negotiator charged. No spokesman was available at the American Embassy to respond to Mr. Nouri's comments. Last August, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal ordered return of Account No. 1 funds to Iran. The United States has agreed in principle to the payback. The release of all Iranian assets blocked in the United States, including military equipment, has recently been linked by the Iranian Parliament Speaker, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, to possible Iranian intercession on behalf of American hostages in Lebanon. Funds and Equipment Iran needs both funds and equipment to pursue its six-year-old war with Iraq. Today, however, Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as denying any link between the money and the hostages. The report was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus."

The New York Times," 1,019 SANDINISTA SOLDIERS REPORTED KILLED DURING '86"," More than 1,000 Government solders were killed in 1986, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra said today in a year-end speech. Mr. Ortega said Government losses in the war with the rebels totaled 1,019 dead and 1,798 wounded. He estimated that the United States-backed rebels had suffered 6,600 casualties, including 4,000 deaths. The figures were roughly equal to those the Government presented at the close of 1985. Mr. Ortega today portrayed the rebel force as shrinking and ''in the process of decomposition.'' ''The army of 30,000 men that President Reagan dreamed of is at this moment reduced to 6,500 mercenaries,'' the Sandinista leader said in an address broadcast live on Nicaraguan radio stations. ''The millions for the mercenary forces have produced nothing.'' Rebel Chief Dispute Figures American officials have recently estimated that the number of rebels, who are known as contras, is over 10,000. In a telephone interview from Miami, the head of the largest contra group, Adolfo Calero Portocarrero of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, said figures announced by Sandinista leaders were unreliable. He said that Sandinista casualties were three times higher than announced today and that rebel losses were only a third as great as Mr. Ortega reported. ''We will show in early 1987 that the Sandinistas are vulnerable,'' Mr. Calero said. ''We will bring the war closer to population centers. We will widen and multiply our fronts throughout the country, with the aid that we are getting and more than we will get.' ''In 1987 we expect the downfall of a regime that is corrupt and that is being eaten up from within,'' he said. In an interview 12 months ago, he predicted that 1986 would be ''the year of liberation for Nicaragua.'' Economy Said to Slow Decline President Ortega said today that Nicaragua's economy had reduced its rate of decline but had not begun to grow. Recalling that the economy shrunk by 5 percent in 1985, he said: ''For 1986, we had we had proposed to grow 6.5 percent. This was not possible.'' The economy came close to zero growth this year, however, and Mr. Ortega said planners hoped for a 2.1 percent growth rate in 1987. ''Nineteen-eighty-six was a year of great sacrifices, adding to the toll of pain and blood for the people of Nicaragua,'' he said. ''The year 1987 will be one of great challenges and sacrifices.'' Mr. Ortega, who is about to complete his second year in office, expressed support for what he described as popular movements in South Africa, Chile, El Salvador and Haiti. He said his Government was committed to democracy, but he warned that Nicaraguans who clamor for more political freedom should prove their good faith by ''first defending sovereignty, self-determination, the country's dignity.'' ''In 1986 the Congress of the United States approved the sending of military advisers, ammunition and transport, and $100 milion to continue terrorist actions in Nicaragua,'' he said. ''We must remain prepared to confront aggression.'' Honduran Fighting Cited Mr. Ortega referred to military campaigns that Nicaraguan troops conducted against contra bases near the border with Honduras in March and again in November and December. As has been his custom, he did not specify whether the fighting had been in Nicaragua or Honduras, but he charged that contras maintained bases in Honduras and were ''trying to invade our territory from Honduran territory.'' Honduran leaders asserted this month that Sandinista troops searching for contras had crossed into Honduras. They sent planes to bomb two targets inside Nicaragua in retaliation. Diplomats and military officers in Managua said they expected contra activity to increase over the coming months as weapons bought with American aid money began reaching rebel soldiers. The Government reported two fatal incidents over the weekend. Six people including two children were said to have died when contras attacked a farm cooperative near the ranching town of Amoapa in the central part of the country. In the border province of Jinotega, two men on a military truck carrying supplies to coffee pickers were killed and five others wounded when a mine exploded beneath them. Mr. Ortega said today that there had been 35,000 victims since the Nicaraguan war began five years go. That figure was understood to include all military and civilian dead, wounded and missing."
The New York Times," Josh Parker, Options Trader, Is New York Player of Year"," The most successful New York City player in 1986 was Josh Parker, a young man who recently abandoned the profession of law to join the small army of bridge experts trading options on the American Stock Exchange. By winning the Reisinger Knockout Team Championship, placing second in the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship and the Big Apple Swiss Teams, together with high finishes in several other events, Parker won two titles: New York Player of the Year and New York Team Player of the Year. In the diagramed deal played at the Cavendish Club, Parker overcame a bad trump break in his four-spade contract. The cue bid of four diamonds was a strong raise to four spades, and South rejected the slam invitation. West took two diamond winners and shifted to a trump. South took dummy's three winners, leaving the jack at large. He then led four rounds of clubs, and East refused to ruff. The position was now this: The routine play of taking a heart finesse would have failed. But Parker saw a way to give himself an extra chance. East had played high-low in diamonds, indicating a doubleton, so the distribution was clear: East had to have three hearts together with the spade jack. East was therefore given the lead with a trump and was forced to lead hearts. This preserved the normal finesse of the jack, but also provided for the actual layout. East led the ten, covered around the table by the jack, queen and king. Then the eight was finessed to make the game. If East had instead led the seven, South would have played the eight. Yesterday's bridge column erroneously credited a line from ''Promises, Promises'' to Burt Bacharach. The lyricist was Hal David, with music by Mr. Bacharach. BRIDGE"
The New York Times, Macy's Stores To Open Today," For what is believed to be the first time in the company's 128 years, Macy's stores nationwide will be open New Year's Day. Judith Cohen, a spokesman for the store, said executives would be looking at the experiment ''very carefully'' this year to determine whether it would become a permanent policy. The decision to open the stores was based on the assumption that potential shoppers would be grateful for a place to go during the holiday. ''We're open most holidays and sales are good,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''Management figured that New Year's Day would be the same.'' Several months ago, employees were given the option of working New Year's, with additional pay or compensatory time as an incentive. ''No employee had to work who didn't want to,'' Ms. Cohen said. She said she did not know how many employees had agreed to work, but added that it was ''enough to keep the store open.'' The city's other major department stores - including Saks, Bloomingdale's and Bergdorf Goodman - will all be closed New Year's Day. Macy's will have shortened hours, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.

The New York Times, ADDED INCENTIVE FOR ONE MORRIS," Jamie Morris has a chance to become the first known major college football player to walk around wearing the ring of a victorious player in the Super Bowl. All the Michigan junior tailback needs is one victory for himself Thursday in the Rose Bowl and three victories by the Giants. Morris, the slick little running back, is the youngest of the three brothers of the Giants' slick little running back, Joe Morris. The two have agreed to trade bowl rings if Michigan beats Arizona State Thursday in the oldest bowl game and the Giants get to and win the Super Bowl -which will be played in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 25. ''We've been talking about it all year,'' said Jamie. ''Joe and I talk once or twice a week. It's about life in general. It's also about football. Once, when we talked before the season, we talked about maybe we could both get to the Rose Bowl this year. And I said then we could trade rings.'' Michigan No Surprise Such talk before the season was a longer shot for Joe, who seemed then to have less chance of getting to the Pasadena Super Bowl than Jamie had of making it to the New Year's Day Rose Bowl. Michigan, after all, entered this season favored to win the Big Ten title and get here. The Wolverines and Jamie lived up to expectations. The two excellent running backs are not exactly peas in a pod, but from a distance they appear much the same as they scamper and twist their ways for big gains. They're both 5 feet 7 inches tall and the sons of Earl Morris, another 5-7 running back who played high school football in St. Louis. Jamie and Joe and their two brothers and two sisters grew up in Ayer, Mass. Their father, a former Green Beret master sergeant in Vietnam, is a postmaster in Groton, Mass. Jamie and Joe differ for two notable reasons. Joe is stockier, weighing about 195 pounds to Jamie's 180. Joe and two other brothers, Mike and Larry, played in the Carrier Dome at Syracuse, where Joe broke the rushing records of Jimmy Brown, Floyd Little, Larry Csonka and Ernie Davis. Jamie went to Michigan, where he played in Michigan Stadium, an outdoor stadium so big that, he said, ''The first time I went out on that field I wanted to turn around and run off. I never saw so many people in my life.'' Regarded as Too Small Bo Schembechler, Michigan's coach, is from the old school. Even though he doesn't stand much taller than Jamie Morris, Schembechler said: ''I told Jamie when we recruited him he was too small to be a running back and we wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance to try to be a running back for us. Good thing I did, isn't it?'' ''My friends thought I'd naturally go to Syracuse, what with three older brothers who were Syracuse football players,'' Jamie said. ''But Joe told me to go where I'd be happy. When I told him I thought I'd be happier at Michigan, he said, 'Go Blue.' '' The kick-return specialist role didn't last long. Jamie became very happy at Michigan in just his third game as a freshman when Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback. Except for times when injuries took their toll, Jamie has started at tailback for the Wolverines since. This season he seemed headed for a big season when a knee injury against Florida State forced him to sit out the Wisconsin game the following week. There appeared to be little chance the tailback would reach his goal of 1,000 yards rushing for the regular season. But in the final game against Ohio State - a game Michigan had to win to get to the Rose Bowl - Morris carried 29 times for 210 yards and a season total of 1,039 yards. Took Time to Heal ''That pop on the knee in the game against Florida State hassled me a lot,'' Jamie said. ''Even after I came back, the knee bothered me when I tried to cut. I finally felt good in the Purdue game and finally felt I was all the way back against Ohio State.'' Michigan played only two games on grass in 1986 - at Purdue and at Notre Dame - and won them both. The Rose Bowl has a grass field that Schembechler says ''isn't really very good.'' Morris isn't worried about slowing down on the grass, but he said, ''You have to learn to keep your feet under you more or else you'll slip. Because we beat Purdue and Notre Dame, I don't think the grass here will bother me.''  ROSE BOWL"
The New York Times, FIRST-TIME GIVERS TO NEEDIEST HOPING TO BEGIN A TRADITION," First-time contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund hope to make giving to the fund a tradition. Karen Price of Manhattan, who gave $10 to the fund's 75th annual appeal, said: ''I've been reading about the Neediest Cases Fund for the past few weeks, and although I realize the fund has been in existence for many years, this is the first year I've ever heard of it. So I'd like to start an annual tradition for myself by contributing to the fund this year.'' The partners fund of Morgan Stanley & Company, investment bankers, sent $1,000. ''We expect this first donation to be the start of a long-term trend,'' company officials said. ''This is my first contribution to the fund,'' said Alice M. White of Manhattan, who gave $75. ''Heavens knows why it took me so long, but it won't be the last.'' Contribution Is Doubled ''Because the problems only seem to get more difficult for the needy people of New York, we felt we had to double our contribution this time around,'' said Edith and Fred Danzig of Eastchester, N.Y., in a note accompanying their $300 gift.

The New York Times, Man Held in Assaults In Housing Projects," A 24-year-old Manhattan man was charged yesterday in a three-month series of knifepoint robberies and sexual assaults in East Harlem housing projects, the authorities said. The man, Herbert Sheppard, 24 years old, was arrested Tuesday after a resident of 1485 Park Avenue, near 109th Street, telephoned the police to complain that a suspicious-looking man was loitering in the halls of her building. Mr. Sheppard, of 80 East 110th Street, faced six counts of robbery, four counts of sodomy, two counts of sexual abuse, one count of attempted rape and one of attempted sodomy, according to an assistant district attorney, Linda Fairstein. Mr. Sheppard is accused of accosting 10 women between the ages of 11 and 46 between Oct. 1 and Dec. 6. METRO DATELINES"
The New York Times, REHNQUIST URGES RAISES FOR JUDGES," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist supports a proposal to give most Federal judges at least a $50,000-a-year raise, saying the pay increase is needed to draw ''first-rate talent.'' In his first year-end statement on the Federal court system, Chief Justice Rehnquist called on President Reagan and Congress today ''to make realistic salary adjustments for judges.'' The annual pay that takes effect Thursday is $81,100 a year for Federal trial judges, $85,700 for appellate judges and $107,200 for Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice's annual salary is $111,700. A Federal advisory commission recently urged higher salaries for all top Federal officials. Among the commission's proposals were annual salaries of $130,000 for trial judges, $135,000 for appellate judges, $165,000 for Associate Justices and $175,000 for the Chief Justice. Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that some people felt the commission's recommendations were excessive because Federal judges already earn far more than most Americans. Other Lawyers' Income ''If Federal judges were drawn from a cross-section of occupations this would be a valid criticism,'' he said. ''The relevant comparison is not with salaries and wages throughout the economy but with the income of other lawyers. ''In 1985, the median income of a 50-year-old partner in a law firm was $164,000. We must be able to attract this kind of person, among others, to the Federal judiciary if we are to maintain its tradition of excellence.'' ''We will always have men and women available to fill vacancies in the Federal judiciary,'' he said, ''but if salaries are not made comparable to the average in private practice, fewer of these candidates will possess the first-rate talent which has always been a hallmark of the Federal bench.'' Chief Justice Rehnquist, a member of the Supreme Court since 1972, was promoted to Chief Justice this year to replace Warren E. Burger. In his year-end statement, he praised his predecessor's efforts to improve the administration of justice. ''He forced us to realize that the Congress, the executive and the judiciary cannot move in splendid isolation from one another, any more than can the Federal and state courts,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said."
The New York Times, New Year's Wishes," On the morning after, it's time for some New Year's sports wishes: One, now that Ray Perkins is the Tampa Bay Bucs' new coach and vice president of operations, that he no longer be allowed to play with matches. In leaving the Giants for the University of Alabama as Bear Bryant's successor four years ago, and in leaving Tuscaloosa now, he has burned two bridges in his search for the ideal job. ''I've never been satisfied in my life,'' he once said, ''and I hope I never am.'' But for the moment, Perkins surely is satisfied with the quarterback whom the Bucs surely will take with the first choice in the National Football League draft - Vinny Testaverde, the Heisman Trophy winner. But would Perkins have taken the Bucs' job if they weren't assured of selecting the University of Miami passer? Two, that the Rose, the Orange, the Sugar and the Cotton Bowls form the opening round of an eight-team college football playoff format toward a national championship. The four winning teams would advance to the semifinals that would determine the two teams for the title game. Of all the bowl games this time, only tomorrow night's Sunkist Fiesta Bowl between Miami and Penn State will be accepted as having defined the nation's best team. As a result, the four traditional bowls have dissolved this time into exhibitions for television programming and excuses for a vacation for students, alumni and boosters. If the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl scenario for No. 1 develops again next year, the four traditional bowls will be forced to rethink their positions on a national championship playoff. Up to now, the traditional bowls have resisted proposals that they form the opening round of a playoff. Each bowl always hopes to put together what the Tempe, Ariz., promoters did - the No. 1 and No. 2-ranked teams. If the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl turns out to be a onetime happening in college football's annual search for No. 1, the traditional bowls won't surrender their alliances with the major conference champions. But if the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl attracts another showdown for No. 1 next year between two independents, the traditional bowls might realize that four first-round playoff games are more meaningful than four empty exhibitions. More meaningful games also will attract more meaningful television dollars, as Miami and Penn State learned. Miami and Penn State each will take home $2.4 million, more than each of the Super Bowl XXI teams, not counting the pro players' shares. At the Super Bowl, each of the winning players will collect $36,000 from the National Football League office, each of the losing players $18,000 - a total of at least $1.8 million and $900,000 for the players on the winning and losing teams, based on 50 shares per team. The winning Super Bowl franchise itself will receive $1.32 million and the losing franchise $960,000 to cover the shares for coaches and front-office personnel as well as expenses, aside from air fare. With this year's game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., each team will receive the value of 100 first-class round-trip tickets between Los Angeles and its home-area airport. The clubs apply that air fare money toward chartered jets. Three, that the N.F.L. acknowledge at least partial responsibility for the use of steroids among college football players. Year after year, the N.F.L. has talked about how its athletes are ''bigger, stronger and faster,'' but some of those bigger, stronger and faster athletes didn't get that way just by lifting weights. Perhaps in the hope of adding strength and bulk in order to attract N.F.L. scouts, some college players have used steroids, as the National Collegiate Athletic Association tests have shown. And who knows how many other players have used steroids? According to Commissioner Pete Rozelle, when the N.F.L. begins testing for steroids at its training camps this summer, it will rely on education and rehabilitation for those who test positive. But what happens to a repeat offender? Four, that Don King, the boxing promoter, be prohibited from promoting a fight involving any boxer managed by his son, Carl. The New York State Athletic Commission is now under investigation by the state's Inspector General's Office over allegations that Carl King managed both James (Bonecrusher) Smith and Tim Witherspoon in their recent World Boxing Association heavyweight title bout at Madison Square Garden. But the answer is not merely to determine if Carl King managed both fighters. The answer is to prevent relatives of any promoter from managing any fighters on that promoter's cards. ''When you're a manager, you do what's best for your fighter,'' Witherspoon's trainer, Slim Jim Robinson, said after his Witherspoon was dethroned in a first-round knockout. ''Not what's best for the promoter.'' ''When we talked with Don King before the fight,'' Witherspoon said of a meeting with the promoter, ''Carl sat on Smith's side of the table. Carl was not there on behalf of me, but on behalf of his own blood.'' But a blood-relative rule in New York boxing wouldn't prevent Carl King from managing fighters on Don King's cards elsewhere unless other major boxing states, especially Nevada and New Jersey, adopted a similar rule. If boxing is ever abolished, it will be for what happens outside the ring, not in it. SPORTS OF THE TIMES"
The New York Times, REPORT ANALYZES INCREASED COSTS OF TELEPHONE BILLS," THE average consumer's telephone bill has risen by nearly 20 percent in the three years since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, according to a report made public by the Consumer Federation of America. Even after allowing for substantial reductions in long-distance telephone rates, the report says, the increased cost of local service has accounted for ''the largest sustained real increase in residential telephone bills since the passage of the Communications Act over half a century ago.'' When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced its plan in January 1982 to settle a Federal antitrust suit by divesting itself of local phone companies, the telephone company predicted that local rates would rise by about 8 percent to 10 percent a year and that long-distance rates would rise at a rate slightly slower than inflation. The Consumer Federation report says that local rates have risen by 40 percent, or 10 percent faster than A.T.&T. predicted, since the breakup in 1983. Consumer groups say they believe customers are beginning to feel that deregulation so far has benefited only the local telephone companies by allowing them to diversify their business and in that way increase their revenues. This year, for the first time, consumers in three states - Arizona, Oregon and Maine - were asked to vote on bills that would have further deregulated local telephone rates, but in each state they voted against further change. At a time when state utility regulators are predicting an era of lower utility rates because of dropping interest rates and the new tax code, consumer groups say it is time for those regulators to begin asking telephone companies to pass on to consumers some of the profits they have received through deregulation. The Consumer Federation report is based on an analysis of telephone costs compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Federation, a nonprofit organization that represents more than 200 state and local consumer groups, said in its report: ''We were told that widespread, cutthroat competition would drive down telephone prices and bring information-age gadgets and services to all consumers. Instead, consumers must pay significantly more to get the same old service they had prior to the breakup.'' The report says the Consumer Price Index shows that the amount consumers pay in local telephone costs rose by 39.8 percent from January 1984 to October 1986. Long-distance tolls on calls made within states increased by 4 percent, while long-distance rates for calls that cross state lines have dropped by 17 percent in that time. In a survey of basic monthly costs, excluding the amount of money paid for calls but including fixed fees for access to long-distance service, installation and wiring costs, local phone charges have risen to about $15.40 a month this year from $10.55 a month in 1983. Another study, the preliminary results of a survey scheduled to come out later this month, indicates that 20 percent to 25 percent of households with annual incomes of less than $15,000 do not have phones. About half of those families used to have phones, according to the report by the United States Public Interest Research Group, an association of state public interest research groups originally formed by Ralph Nader. Pamela Gilbert, the association's staff attorney, said more than half of those now without phones say they cannot afford them. The study was based on a door-to-door survey of about a thousand households in 10 states with annual incomes below $15,000. The percentage of American households with telephones grew from 78 percent in 1960 to 93 percent in 1980, but has hovered around 91 to 93 percent for the past six years. Ms. Gilbert said the cost of telephone service was decreasing in the 1960's and 1970's, but that since 1980 the true cost, including inflation, has risen. The Consumer Federation report compares the earnings of the Bell operating companies with those of other corporations in Business Week magazine's list of the top 1,000 American companies, ranked according to market value. It says that in a period when regulators granted $5.5 billion in phone rate increases, the phone companies earned more money than comparable private corporations. In 1984 the phone companies earned the same return on equity, about 13.2 percent, that others in the top 1,000 earned. In 1985, however, their average return was 13.7 percent, while the average for all the companies in the top 1,000 was 11.4 percent, and in 1986 they earned 14 percent as against the average of 10.9 percent for the top 1,000 companies. The phone companies also showed better earnings than other utility companies, the report said. If the Bell operating companies had earned rates of return similar to those of the top 1,000 companies or other utilities, the Consumer Federation said, the cost to consumers would have been $1.25 billion to $2 billion less. And if those rates of return had also reflected the benefits the phone companies received from lower interest on their capital costs and depreciation expenses, their rates would have been another $1 billion less, the report said. Thomas J. Novick, executive director of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, said of the recent vote in that state on further phone deregulation, ''We think in large part the vote reflected a distrust of the phone company.'' In Oregon and Maine, the voters were considering whether to allow their regional telephone companies to charge all customers for local calls as they now charge for long-distance calls, based on the number and lengths of calls, and the time of day and distance. The Oregon vote was on whether to ban the phone company from establishing such a mandatory system of local metered service. About 80 percent voted in favor of the ban. Thus the company can offer local metered service for customers who want it, but must continue to offer local service at a flat rate, as phone companies have traditionally done. In Maine, the state utilities commission had approved mandatory local metered service. After 50,000 voters signed a referendum petition, the measure was revised to require the phone company to also offer a flat rate, which consumer groups said was higher than the metered rates approved by the commission. The measure eventually put on the ballot prohibited mandatory local metered service and required a ''low-cost flat rate.'' Although the local phone company spent more than $1.6 million to defeat the proposal, it passed. ''I think these votes show that people want traditional service at low cost,'' said Craig McDonald, the field director for Public Citizen, a consumer group based in Washington. ''They don't want to be subsidizing the other new ventures of the phone company.'' Arizona voters considered a bill that would have transferred regulation of phone rates to the Legislature and would simultaneously have deregulated most of the company's new ventures - primarily data transmission. Arizona voters rejected the measure, according to Susan Williams, director of the state's Residential Utility Consumer Office, because ''the telephone customer, while perhaps puzzled by the names used, has not been fooled by the general direction, which is to sock it to the small business users or the small residential users.''"
The New York Times, Jersey Dairy Loses L.I. Sales Ban Appeal," A New York State appeals court ruled yesterday that the New York Agriculture Commissioner acted properly in denying a New Jersey dairy access to Long Island markets. In a unanimous ruling, a five-member panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled that the Commissioner, Joseph Gerace, correctly decided under New York's milk-licensing laws that letting Farmland Dairies sell milk in Nassau and Suffolk Counties would ''have the potential for disrupting the market's balanced distribution structure.'' The ruling, written by Justice Robert Main, continues the consistent support the state's controversial milk-licensing system has enjoyed in court. Farmland, based in Wallington, N.J., has challenged that system by trying to get into the lucrative New York City-area markets. It has won the right to sell milk on Staten Island, but its request to expand into the other boroughs was rejected by Mr. Gerace on Dec. 11. METRO DATELINES"
The New York Times," Dr. Reinhold Benesch, Biochemist, Dies at 67"," Dr. Reinhold Benesch, a biochemist best known for his study of red blood cells, died of complications arising from lymphatic cancer, at Columbia-Presyterian Medical Center Tuesday. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan. Dr. Benesch and his wife, Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, were professors of biochemistry and shared a research laboratory at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. Their collaboration focused on the mechanisms by which hemoglobin transports oxygen to living tissues. In 1966 he and his wife discovered that an organic phosphorous compound, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, plays a key role in loosening the bonds between hemoglobin and oxygen, thereby improving the flow of oxygen from blood to the tissues. Dr. Benesch was born in Poland on Aug. 13, 1919, and immigrated to England, where he received a bachelor's degree from Leeds University in 1941. Later, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and received a doctorate in biochemistry at Northwestern University. Dr. Benesch was affiliated with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and since 1966 held the concurrent position of professor of biochemistry at Columbia. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Susan, and a son, Andrew, both of New York City."

The New York Times," MUSIC: ED WILLIAMS, BLUES"," Raw-boned, old-fashioned Chicago blues has a new young master - Li'l Ed Williams, who led his band, the Blues Imperials, Monday at the Lone Star Cafe. The 31-year-old Li'l Ed, who works at a car wash and studied with the bluesman J. B. Hutto, sings and plays slide guitar with a fierce disregard for the steps of the well-tempered scale. He uses his fingers and fingernails instead of a pick, and while the Blues Imperials chug crisply along behind him, Li'l Ed's shivering, keening guitar solos recapture the vocalistic cries of deep Delta blues. Mr. Williams, who wears a fez on stage like Mr. Hutto, is a cheerful showman. He belts his songs in a gutsy baritone, but his guitar solos are the heart of his sets. For longer solos, he would walk out into the audience, holding his guitar up to listeners, dropping to his knees, leaning back like a limbo dancer or even scuttling - forward and backward, on his knees - as he played. The material in Monday's late set was basic Chicago blues, devoted to loneliness and resilience. Li'l Ed and the Blues Imperials made the songs heartfelt and rowdy, without a hint of funk or jazz to dilute the blues. For them, the tradition is alive."
The New York Times, Rheem Fought On Bradford Bid," The Justice Department moved to block the pending acquisition of the Bradford-White Corporation by the Rheem Manufacturing Company on antitrust grounds. The department said it would institute a civil antitrust suit to challenge the transaction. New York City-based Rheem is the nation's third-largest manufacturer of residential water heaters. Philadelphia-based Bradford-White is the fifth largest. Charles Rule, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, said the lawsuit would assert that the proposed acquisition would lessen competition in the manufacture and sale of residential water heaters in the United States. In 1985, sales of residential water heaters in the nation totaled about $915 million. Rheem and Bradford-White had combined sales of about $262 million. COMPANY NEWS"
The New York Times, FILM: NO-WIN SITUATION FOR HERO OF 'WISDOM'," John Wisdom, played by the possibly talented Emilio Estevez, who also wrote and directed the movie, is in a no-win situation. Though he's an intelligent, clean-cut, high-school-educated man of 23, he can't get a decent job because of his police record. As a teen-ager, Wisdom once got drunk with his friends and stole a car, a felony for which he was put on probation for four years. Now his past haunts him. Being honest, he always acknowledges his record when he applies for white-collar positions and always is turned down. He's even dismissed from his job as a janitor because, says his boss, he's overqualified and lacks the love required for cleaning offices and lavatories. According to ''Wisdom,'' which opened yesterday at the Baronet and other theaters, society has left open only one route to the young man -crime, but what sort of crime? In what should be a funny sequence (but isn't), he considers, in turn, kidnapping, arson and murder, none of which really interest him. Like so many of his contemporaries, including beauty-contest winners, Wisdom is most interested in that vaguely generalized group termed people. Suddenly he has it. He'll hold up banks and, instead of taking money, he'll destroy mortgage records, thus freeing all those little guys on whom the lending institutions are foreclosing in the economic squeeze of the mid-80's. Most of ''Wisdom'' is played as cut-rate, populist comedy - Wisdom and his girlfriend, Karen (Demi Moore), being hailed by the public for their unorthodox, philanthropic exploits in robbing banks throughout the Southwest. Soon, however, things go wrong for the do-gooders, possibly because no one could think of a lighthearted way to get them out of their mess. Mr. Estevez is far more at ease as an actor than as a writer or director, though he's certainly as competent as most people making television movies. The problem is that ''Wisdom'' is aggressively boring, either because one can predict everything that's going to happen and exactly how it will look on the screen or because the concept of the film eventually seems even more confused than the title character. After devoting the second half of the movie to pretty images of himself and Miss Moore on their socially conscious joyride, Mr. Estevez, as Wisdom, is heard on the soundtrack saying something to the effect that the public was wrong to see the pair as romantic heroes. Under the circumstances, that thought comes a bit late. The performances aren't especially good or bad. Mr. Estevez and Miss Moore are photogenic, and Tom Skerritt and Veronica Cartwright, as Wisdom's worried, well-meaning parents, are no less bland than their roles. The R-rated movie is titled ''Wisdom,'' but by the end it's become ''Bonnie and Clunk.'' THE CAST - WISDOM, written and directed by Emilio Estevez; director of photography, Adam Greenberg; film editor, Michael Kahn; music by Danny Elfman; produced by Bernard Williams; released by the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation.

The New York Times, 7 Injured at Columbia In a Fraternity Fire," Seven people were injured yesterday when fire rose through a fraternity house at Columbia University, sending one group of students onto a third-floor ledge to be rescued with ladders, the Fire Department said. Two firefighters and five people who were inside the Iota Epsilon Pi fraternity house were treated at St. Luke's Hospital for smoke inhalation and released, fire officials said. One also was treated for a sprained ankle. Among the injured were two girls, 10 and 11 years of age, who were staying with their sister at the co-ed fraternity, according to a Columbia spokesman, Henry Fuhrman. The fire broke out in the basement of the four-story brownstone at 534 West 114th Street at 1:07 A.M. Although the cause remains under investigation, a department spokesman said it appeared the blaze began with an electrical short circuit in the basement and spread upward into the building.

The New York Times, CHILE WILL END STATE OF SIEGE," President Augusto Pinochet said today that a state of siege, imposed hours after an attempt on his life in September, would not be renewed when it expired early next month. He also announced a virtual end to the system of exile under which thousands of political opponents have been banned from returning to the country. General Pinochet said the state of siege, now in force only in Santiago after being lifted in other parts of the country, had served its purpose. In the text of his speech, issued to the press before his year-end address tonight, the President gave no figures for the number of exiles who would be allowed to return. According to human rights officials, about 3,500 Chileans are barred from entering the country. General Pinochet said that over the next 90 days the Government would reduce the list until only those who were considered a ''serious risk'' to the country would be included. The state of siege was declared after left-wing guerrillas ambushed the presidential motorcade outside Santiago, killing five of General Pinochet's bodyguards. Despite the lifting of the state of siege, the military Government will still hold wide powers to arrest and to restrict freedom of information, movement and assembly under a state of emergency that has been in force, apart from a brief period in 1983, since the 1973 military coup."

The New York Times, BELGIAN DANCERS PROTEST DISMISSAL OF VALERY PANOV," Thirty-three members of the Royal Ballet of Flanders are holding a sit-in at the Antwerp headquarters of the Belgian state dance company in a protest against the recent dismissal of Valery Panov, its artistic director. The sit-in began last Friday, forcing the closing of the building and the cancellation of three performances. The dancers say they expect to remain in the building, which houses dance studios and administrative offices, at least through Monday. ''We are planning to stay here until Panov is taken back,'' Nancy Glynn, a dancer with the 62-member company and a leader of the protesters, said yesterday. Mr. Panov, a former Kirov Ballet dancer, became internationally known when his fight to emigrate from the Soviet Union drew support from dance celebrities around the world. He and his wife, the dancer Galina Panov, emigrated in 1974. Mr. Panov was named director of the Royal Ballet of Flanders in August 1984. His contract was to have run for five years. On Dec. 1, he was informed by letter that his contract would be terminated on June 30, at the end of the season. Last Friday, the dancers say, they were informed by the company that Mr. Panov had been dismissed. Marcel Van Der Bruggen, chairman of the board of directors, said Mr. Panov was dismissed because of his administrative record. ''He didn't make a budget,'' Mr. Van Der Bruggen said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''He didn't organize the company as it was organized before. There was no inner discipline in the lessons and rehearsals. Some principal dancers danced too much outside our company.'' Trouble Over Promotions Mr. Van Der Bruggen said that Mr. Panov had also failed to follow the prescribed system of promotion within the company. ''His answer was 'I am only a creator,' '' the board chairman said. ''But then he is not an artistic director.'' He added that the board had asked Mr. Panov to reform his administrative methods. ''But he was not working to change - only to make opposition and agitation,'' Mr. Van Der Bruggen said. The board notified Mr. Panov that he would be paid through June. ''I had one of the biggest administrative machines in this place, so I never worried about talking about money,'' Mr. Panov said by telephone from Belgium yesterday. He added that he felt the board had been less than candid with him, and that the matter was ''a personal fight'' with Mr. Van Der Bruggen. Mr. Panov said he had asked the Belgian Minister of Culture to make Mr. Van Der Bruggen the head of a separate company that performs in musicals. ''That was a month ago,'' Mr. Panov said. ''He moved me. He wants to keep the power, but I will stay with the company until the end.'' He said he planned to spend New Year's Eve with the striking dancers. Friends have been taking food to the protesters, and a teacher has been helping to give them daily classes. But no one, it seemed, could figure out how to operate the company switchboard. 'He Changed This Company' The dancers do not dispute that Mr. Panov had ''a lack of organization,'' as Ben Van Cauwenburgh, a leading member of the company, put it. ''But he changed this company completely,'' Mr. Van Cauwenburgh said. ''He was a turning point. And they can't see his success.'' A dancers' committee met with members of the board of directors on Tuesday. The board refused to reinstate Mr. Panov but offered to let him continue as resident choreographer. Ms. Glynn said the dancers had met twice since Dec. 1, with 80 percent voting to support Mr. Panov at each meeting. The dancers have also conducted letter-writing campaigns, audience appeals and a press conference. ''We are now trying to meet with the Minister of Culture,'' Mr. Van Cauwenburgh said. ''But it is very difficult to talk with him. He is busy.'' ''If George Balanchine had not been supported by Lincoln Kirstein,'' Mr. Panov said, ''he would never have come in. I am very upset that behind my shoulder there is no person like Mr. Kirstein.''"
The New York Times, U.S. CALLS HONDURAS TRAINING A CONTINUATION," The Defense Department said today that new maneuvers in Honduras by thousands of United States troops represented a continuation, rather than an increase, in the American military presence in that Central American neighbor of Nicaragua's. The department said military engineers involved in the exercises that began this week were actually preparing the way for future maneuvers by the United States. About 1,100 troops, mostly from Fort Bragg, N.C., are participating in the first phases of the exercises, which began Monday and are to run until mid-April, officials said today. The numbers of troops could increase when the exercises move into a new phase in March, but a Pentagon spokesman said details would not be disclosed until a later date. In addition to the maneuvers announced Monday, hundreds of United States Army Reserve and National Guard troops are rotating in and out of Honduras in a separate road-building exercise known as Blazing Trails, which will bring thousands of reservists to Honduras for brief stays over the next four months. Time of High Tension While the two exercises do not represent a change of course for American military policy toward Honduras, they come at a time of high tension in the region and are important for several military reasons. Some of the facilities that are being improved are close to the Nicaraguan border. One of them, at Jamastran, is near the scene of recent fighting between Nicaraguan forces and contras, or rebels, who oppose the Nicaraguan Government. It was used by American helicopters to transport Honduran troops who fought off a Nicaraguan attack on the contras early this month. In addition, the future exercises that will use the newly enhanced facilities will more closely link American and Honduran forces and will improve American abilities to control and resupply military maneuvers in places like Honduras, officials said. Pentagon officials said that the exercises announced Monday involve 700 members of two engineering battalions stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C., along with 250 supporting troops from the same American base. The remainder of the 1,100 troops sent to Honduras for the exercise are involved in headquarters work or civil affairs, said Lieut. Col. Keith Schneider, a military spokesman. Can't Explain Report He said he was unable to explain a report by The Associated Press from Tegucigalpa, which stated that the Honduran military had put the number of Americans in the exercise at 3,000. He also noted that of the 4,500 National Guard and Reserve troops who will spend time in Honduras over the next few months for Blazing Trails, no more than 600 would be there at any one time."

Ms. Brett said she was unable to give details about the operation, but added that Mr. Shankar, 66 years old, had undergone diagnostic tests at the hospital on Monday. Mr. Shankar, who has been greatly responsible for popularizing Indian music in the West, said on Friday that he had suffered from angina for some time and that it had been kept under control with medicine. He said he had come to New York for tests because the condition had worsened."
The New York Times, Happy New Tax Year," The Earth, Moon and Sun are in rare alignment this week, and so is the Internal Revenue Code. Because of the first three, tides are exceptionally high. Tax rates, meanwhile, are plunging. Tax reform struck at midnight. That makes this, among other things, Happy New Tax Year. New Year's Day needs no special promotion. It is already the world's most widely celebrated holiday. It's a day off everywhere from Albania to Zimbabwe, in all but 15 of the 182 countries, principalities and territories that the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company logs in its annual calendar of momentous occasions. It has not always been thus. In earlier times, the year dawned with the vernal equinox in March. In Afghanistan, it still does. But even in China and Israel, whose people celebrate their own new year with great ceremony, today is a ''New Year's Day'' holiday. Sri Lanka has another twist; it celebrates the new year today and Full Moon Day every month. But holiday-crazed Americans take the prize for celebrating almost everything else. Last year, Congress entertained 305 bills to designate a day, a week, a month or a whole year -and enacted 94. Accordingly, this is the Year of the Reader, the Year of the Americas and the Year of Thanksgiving. In addition, for Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, it's the bicentennial of statehood. For Philadelphia, it is a yearlong ''We the People 200'' celebration, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. That will be an occasion for all America to celebrate a precious legacy from the past. The tax law provides an occasion to celebrate a sensible present legacy to the future. Anyone who lusted after lucrative real estate loopholes had his last chance yesterday. Tycoons who dreamed of capturing General Motors in a tax-friendly takeover are one day too late. For John and Jane Doe, however, it's a day to hail. Public Law 99-514 introduces lower tax rates for almost everyone, fewer exceptions for the favored few and, fairest of all, total tax relief for six million or more people at the bottom of the ladder. One new law will not a happy new year make. It is, however, a very cheerful start."
The New York Times, You Can Call the 1980's 'The Ugly Decade'," Historians and the media are pleased when they can nail down the significance of a period with evocative labels - the Age of the Robber Barons, for example, or the Roaring 20's - for they remind one of salient characteristics. It begins to look as if the 1980's will have to be remembered as the The Ugly Decade, because so many distasteful things have surfaced in the first six years and may continue into the last four. We have witnessed a kind of general know-nothingness in which evading critical problems is a substitute for grappling with them, in which damage-controlling an error is better than avoiding it, in which sitting tall in the saddle is preferred to riding forward, and in which, amid the verbiage, certain essential freedoms and equalities of our national life are diminished and eroded. Notoriously, President Reagan's two Administrations have produced a massive deficit that, if allowed to grow untended for two more years, would modify our national structure. I have watched three other nations, Germany, Japan and Brazil, incur so much debt that their only solution has been to debase their currency, wipe out the debt and damage grievously the middle class. The very rich and the very poor are not seriously hurt, since the rich can afford to lose and the poor have nothing to lose. But the middle is crushed and sometimes never recovers. Meanwhile, the fortunes of the poor, the minorities and students have suffered reverses so grievous that the United States is in danger of losing its reputation as a haven. It is becoming a society in which advantage is to the rich, disadvantage to the poor. Night after night, I hear Administration spokesmen reason that, since the Dow Jones average has risen another 10 points, all is well with the Republic, ignoring the fact that oilmen in Louisiana are wallowing in bankruptcy and farmers in Iowa are losing their farms. And as I listen I recall Oliver Goldsmith's reflection on his deserted village: ''Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.'' During this decade, the accumulation of wealth has been deified. Magazines keep score and glorify the latest adventurer to amass half a billion of other people's money. The 26-year-old lawyer who hauls down his first several million is applauded just before the tardy Feds toss him in the slammer for ignoring moral laws the average high school freshman would have honored. Ivan F. Boesky becomes the prototypical financier of this decade, and the takeover artist who can orchestrate a greenmail coup has become a more lauded hero than the manager of a corporation that is hiring people and making a usable product. The manipulation of money markets is seen as a more important function than the making of things. Thriving businesses find themselves forced to assume vast debt merely to protect themselves instead of improving their productive capabilities. The ugliness of the decade crops up everywhere. The former Secretary of the Interior, James Watt, denigrated our national heritage of parks and open lands. Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d strives to rewrite our constitutional pattern, while ultraconservative religious forces are encouraged to run wild. Our public school system, one of the reasons why we became a superior society, is threatened, and under the banner of protecting home and family, government invades the bedroom and legislates through the courts an accepted code for sexual behavior. One must grant that some of the ugliness has stemmed from phenomena that no Administration could have controlled. Bad weather has hurt farmers. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries collapses and devastates the economies of Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Alaska. The specter of AIDS stalks the land, and terrorism disorganizes world governments. Economies in Latin America collapse and threaten our internal banking system. This has not been a lucky decade. At this unpropitious moment, the Adminstration shoots itself in the foot with its handling of the Iranian hostage crisis, selling arms to a proclaimed enemy and illegally funneling the profits into the murky situation in Central America. Our foreign policy, which other nations properly inspect with magnifying glasses, seems to have been placed in the hands of a Marine lieutenant colonel free-wheeling about the world. There has been disillusionment at home and scorn abroad. For the first time that I can recall in my work abroad, other nations are laughing at us, especially since we spent the last several years lecturing them sanctimoniously to avoid the very errors we were secretly committing. Yet despite the gloom, I believe this decade can be rescued. I pray that no smoking gun will be found in the President's hand; if none is discovered, he has a fighting chance to remedy the present disarray. I hope things can be repaired for the following reason: Since 1960, we have not treated Presidents well. John F. Kennedy was murdered, Gerald R. Ford shot at twice, Lyndon B. Johnson run out of office. Richard M. Nixon resigned, and if Ronald Reagan is emasculated America will appear to the rest of the world as just one more banana republic, unable to achieve or sustain stability. Mr. Reagan's unmatched popularity, at home if not abroad, is an asset that must not be casually wasted. What can be done to save the reputation of this decade? First, the President can stand before the American people and use his unquestioned powers of communication to say: 'I allowed an error to occur. I have corrected it. And I won't let it happen again, for I obey the laws and traditions of this nation.'' Second, he must return foreign policy to the control of those best qualified to conduct it. Cowboys in the White House cellar must be reined in. Third, he should disband his damage-control squad. If error is promptly admitted and rectified, no cleanup squad is needed. Fourth, he must knock off the windy macho verbalisms. We face serious problems, and if in his next State of the Union Message he claims we are still standing tall or that we are once again respected throughout the world because of our victory in Grenada, Congress is going to wince and listeners abroad guffaw. Further ridicule is something we cannot afford. Fifth, he must let it be seen in all he does and says that he is a humane man who cares as much for the poor and the middle class as he does for the rich, who up to now have been the principal beneficiaries of his policies. The necessary corrections can be made without violation of Republican policies, for I am much encouraged by the recent behavior of Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, who seems to have altered course in midstream, talking sense where he once ranted reaction. If he can make the switch, so can the other members of the Administration. Sixth, the President right now ought to wrestle honestly with our deficit and not rely on spurious legerdemain like the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-reduction law. Our Government should raise taxes immediately and cut expenditures dramatically. But since Republicans refuse to do the former and Democrats are unable to do the latter, I suppose we will stagger along toward a major devaluation. I doubt there is much Mr. Reagan can do to break this deadly impasse, given his strong aversion to taxing the well-to-do, but I hope he does not worsen the situation. Seventh, everything the Republican leadership does in the next two years, and all the behavior of the Democratic Congress, ought to point toward a smooth, responsibile transition to the next Administration. Last October, it looked as if that Administration would be Republican, but the debacles engineered by that party make its victory less automatic. Any observer who can predict the tickets of the two major parties in 1988 would be a master seer. I don't even have an opinion, let alone a prediction. The Ugly Decade is drawing to a close. I hope it doesn't get worse. I hope President Reagan can regroup his forces and end his spectacular incumbency in orderly fashion. But he can achieve this only if adventurism ends, only if sensible controls are established and only if the American people are addressed in words of common sense rather than in soothing verbiage."
The New York Times, Israeli Interior Minister Quits to Protest Ruling," The Israeli Interior Minister submitted his resignation today to protest a Supreme Court ruling ordering him to list an American immigrant who underwent a Reform conversion as a Jew in the population registry. The resignation of the official, Yitzhak Peretz, will go into effect next Tuesday at the earliest, the Israeli radio said. Meanwhile, political efforts are being made to persuade Rabbi Peretz to reverse his decision, even though his absence will not threaten the future of the national unity Government, since the Shas Party of which he is a member is not a crucial partner in the coalition. The Shas Party is predominantly made up of Orthodox Sephardic Jews. ''The High Court of Justice demanded that I list a non-Jew as a Jew,'' Rabbi Peretz told the Israeli radio. ''As a Jew and a rabbi loyal to the tradition and Bible of Israel, I have declared and declare again that my hand will never ever sign for a fraudulent conversion that was not conducted according to the Halakha.'' Halakha is the code of Jewish law. The American immigrant, Shoshana Miller, was converted by a Reform rabbi in Colorado Springs before she came to live in Israel. When Ms. Miller immigrated and applied for identity papers, Rabbi Peretz agreed to list her as Jewish, but added alongside her religion the word ''converted.'' The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Dec. 2 that the additional word was illegal and that Rabbi Peretz must relist Ms. Miller merely as a Jew."
The New York Times, Authorities May Release Banned Czech Activists," Czechoslovak authorities ordered Tuesday that three members of a banned cultural group who were arrested in September be released, but they remained in custody pending an appeal of the order, an emigre source said. The source identified the three as Cestmir Hunat, Tomas Krivanek and Vlastimil Drda, members of the defunct Czech Musicians Union's Jazz Section, which opposes state censorship of the arts. Seven Jazz Section activists were arrested in September on suspicion of conducting illegal business, mainly publishing unauthorized works. Two of the group were released Sunday because of ill health. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said authorities did not revoke investigative custody for the remaining two. Founded in 1971, the Jazz Section's nationwide membership of about 7,000 advocates freedom in the arts and opposes controls exerted by the Communist authorities."
The New York Times, HUNTERS ADVISED ON SHIFT TO STEEL SHELLS," A recent newsletter of Long Island's South Shore Waterfowlers Association contains some sound advice for those who are still resisting the use of nontoxic steel shot for duck and goose hunting. Long Island gunners in particular should realize, writes Steve Sanford, a waterfowl biologist with the State Department of Environmental Conservation, that the new steel loads will be required throughout the region in the 1987-1988 season. He advises Long Islanders to purchase no more lead-loaded shells than will be needed for this season's hunting. One might go a step further and suggest that, even if one hunts in an area where it isn't legally required, one should purchase a few boxes of steel-loaded shells and begin to test their efficacy. Great numbers of waterfowl die each year after eating spent lead pellets and, after decades of research, steel shot has emerged as the best nontoxic substitute. After more than 10 years of often bitter debate involving hunters, conservation organizations and state and Federal wildlife agencies, the Department of the Interior, prodded by court action initiated by the National Wildlife Federation, announced this year a program to phase out lead shot for waterfowling throughout the nation by 1991. The plan calls for first making steel shot mandatory in counties in which the annual duck harvest has been more than 20 birds per square mile. In New York State this year, this will involve Suffolk, Nassau, Jefferson, Wayne and Genesee counties. Hunter resistance to steel shot focuses on two things: The lighter steel pellets do not retain their velocity as well as lead pellets of the same diameter and therefore have less penetration at longer ranges, and steel shot can damage the barrels of fine old double guns. On the other hand, steel loads tend to produce more uniform patterns because the harder pellets are more uniform in size and shape than those of lead and also highly resistant to deformation when traveling down a gun barrel. As one who has used steel shot on both ducks and Canada geese for the last few years, I have seen no difference in practical results when shooting at ranges out to 40 or 45 yards. If you are ''on'' the birds at those distances, they will be cleanly killed with the steel-loaded shells. Another objection to steel loads is that they are more expensive, about 25 percent, than their lead counterparts, and this situation isn't likely to change very much. Over the years, many hunters have saved money by loading their own shotshells. There are a few companies offering reloading components for steel shot, an endeavor that calls for more care and precision than does reloading with lead shot. If one goes waterfowling fewer than a dozen times a year, the savings realized aren't worth the trouble. One should take care to prevent steel-loaded shells from getting wet. The pellets will rust, and an extreme result of this could be a charge fused into a near-solid mass. Factory-loaded shells with their new plastic hulls are highly resistant to rain or even being dropped into a pool of water in boat or blind. Lead pellets cannot rust, of course. I write of water-soaked shells from experience. Many years ago when I was in graduate school and as poor as a churchmouse, I often couldn't afford a box of shells with which to go forth and augment the family larder. I was given some shells that the members of a posh gunning club had decided were too old and had heaved by the case into the salt pond that fronted their holdings. A week or two after those shells went overboard, a friend dredged many of them up while oystering and gave half to me. In those days, the shell hulls, or cases, were made of paper that was waterproofed with wax. I arranged those shells, row on row, on newspapers under the black iron kitchen stove, gave them about a month to dry out and began to use them. They were swollen by the immersion, but I got around that by peeling off layer after layer of paper until they would fit in my old double gun. Hunting with them was an unnerving experience. Some performed as a new shell should, but about one in four failed to fire or produced a minuscule explosion that barely drove the pellets from the barrel. Although it is highly unlikely that any reader might have both the opportunity and the inclination to duplicate this caper, I must advise against it. It could result in damage to self or shotgun.

The New York Times, SPRINGSTEEN ALBUM: A SURE THING," The end of 1986 was the time of the monolith: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's ''Live/1975-85.'' Selling as fast as it could be trucked into record stores, blanketing FM airwaves, the five-LP/three-CD set made its debut in Billboard's No. 1 position and has stayed there through December. It's a fine album - but its status as the year's major rock event isn't a good sign. ''Live/1975-85'' is a long-awaited document of rock's most highly praised live performances, but it carries its monumentality lightly. As the album follows Mr. Springsteen's progress from clubs to stadiums, from ''king of the alley'' to high-flown rock poet to self-conscious working-class bard, it shows he hasn't forgotten how to hang loose. Just when the outlook for Mr. Springsteen's characters seems irredeemably bleak and the music starts to trudge, the next song rocks out. While ''Live/1975-85'' is a triumph for Mr. Springsteen (and one more vindication of the college radio stations, critics and fans who latched on to him in 1972 and never let go), the album's riotous reception doesn't simply reflect its high quality. ''Live/ 1975-85'' is also a consumer product involving no little calculation, including its Christmas-season release date. ''Live/1975-85'' isn't just the year's Big Thing; it's also a sure thing. It's a sure thing for radio exposure on FM rock stations that are playing older, proven, guitar-centered, midtempo rock up to 80 percent of the time, in a format misnamed ''classic rock.'' It's a sure thing to receive intense promotion from Columbia Records and from record stores, which count on a giant Christmas seller to bring in customers. And it's a sure thing for Mr. Springsteen, who unveils only one song newer than his 1984 album ''Born in the U.S.A.'' A live album is a standard holding action for both superstars and would-be stars; it's a chance to revive older songs, rev up recent ones and add a few favorite covers of other songwriters. It's worth remembering that in 1975-76, the British rocker Peter Frampton's ''Frampton Comes Alive'' became, briefly, the all-time best-selling album. It, too, fit FM-rock formats perfectly. At this point in his career, it may be Mr. Springsteen's role to make honorable use of pop-business as usual. He made his live album a generous one - comparatively low-priced (discounted to $30 or under, it costs considerably less than what the traffic would bear), well-packaged and stocked with Springsteen songs that hadn't appeared on albums. And knowing the kind of wide media exposure it would inevitably get, Mr. Springsteen made the first single and video clip - the cover of Edwin Starr's Motown hit ''War'' - carry an explicit message. The record business learns from its blockbusters. A few years ago, such multimillion-sellers as Michael Jackson's ''Thriller,'' David Bowie's ''Let's Dance,'' Cyndi Lauper's ''She's So Unusual,'' Prince's ''Purple Rain,'' Tina Turner's ''Private Dancer'' and Mr. Springsteen's ''Born in the U.S.A.'' suggested that there was an audience ready to accept multifarious combinations of rock, pop and funk; while the upshot was a slew of ''multiformat'' albums that tried to please everyone while taking no chances, a few promising hybrids emerged, among them Paul Simon's poly-ethnic pop and the rap-metal of the Beastie Boys. By contrast, ''Live/1975-85'' proves only that sure things are sure things. Solid as the music is, the album is still a retrospective. It only looks back. Music for Young Fogies ''Live/1975-85'' capped a year in rock that might be characterized as the Revenge of the Baby Boom. Tempos slowed; the Top 40 was riddled with ballads, usually a sign of an older audience, and song lyrics gazed toward the gauzy, halcyon 1960's. Huey Lewis and the News supplied a young fogies' manifesto with ''Hip to Be Square.'' Aretha Franklin's ''Jimmy Lee'' linked first love to a Motown beat, while Eddie Money explicitly summoned the early 1960's in ''Take Me Home Tonight'' with the voice of Ronnie Spector, herself, singing ''Be My Baby.'' Blues and 1960's soul, seen from 20 years later as a single style, showed up in the music of Peter Gabriel, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Simply Red and Robert Cray; Prince and the Bangles reveled in psychedelia and 1960's pop, while R.E.M. scored a major hit with a 1960's throwaway, ''Superman.'' John Cougar Mellencamp's ''R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.'' is subtitled ''A Salute to 1960's Rock.'' Another 1960's legacy, songs with a political flavor, also re-emerged -not just Bruce Springsteen's ''War,'' but Bruce Hornsby's ''Way It Is'' (about dignity battling unemployment and race discrimination), Genesis' ''Land of Confusion'' (which has nebulous lyrics but has been marketed with a video clip that openly mocks Ronald Reagan) and Timbuk 3's sardonic ''The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades'' (about ''studying nuclear science''). Those shifts in tempo and topic could mean baby-boomers are once again flaunting their numerical strength. Certainly the record business sees it that way; all the major labels activated or reactivated their jazz divisions this year to release music (and sometimes background music) aimed at more mature listeners. The continuing sales explosion of compact disks - a high-priced way of buying music, and the province of well-heeled consumers - also suggests that boomers are business. Then again, as songs slow down and arrangements grow plush, rock and pop may just be drifting away from their traditional constituency. Younger whipper-snappers (up into their mid-20s), with the short attention spans and the fondness for noise, can get more and better special effects from television and movies -particularly now, when radio programmers are all but eliminating new bands and new music from their playlists. It will take music that raises hackles and unnerves young fogies, and finds ways for the public to hear it, to revitalize the younger pop audience - and to remind their parents that real 1960's music was anything but bland. Food-Music Connection Predicting rock-and-roll's future is a thankless task, but recent years suggest a new kind of correlation: food fads have been leading rock fads by six months to a year. The vogue for blackened redfish and Bayou peppers presaged a flurry of Cajun-tinged rock, from Rockin' Sidney's ''My Toot-Toot'' to Dire Straits' ''Walk of Life.'' A Caribbean craze was reflected in a new lilt for songs by Lionel Richie, the Miami Sound Machine and Steve Winwood. Then there was a rediscovery of all-American food, and a resurgence of hard-rocking, guitar-driven American bands from Bon Jovi to the de-funked Talking Heads. In hindsight, it all sounds simple. But for the would-be oracle, the trick is finding how to apply the food metaphor. At the moment, homey bistros, grazing menus and fish specialists seem to be proliferating in New York. Does this mean we should expect cabaret songs? Short-short rockers? Sea chanteys? In six months, the answer should be obvious. CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"
The New York Times, Afghan Throne of Bayonets," As the Afghanistan war grinds into its eighth year, the Soviet Union seems of two minds about its bloodiest encounter since World War II. Mikhail Gorbachev now feeds hopes of withdrawal and reconciliation. He even permits open criticism of the war by Andrei Sakharov. Yet there are only token reductions of a Soviet occupation army of 110,000. The investment in roads and bases implies a policy of absorption and annexation. The war's costs in life are bitter, most unforgivably for the Afghan people. Hundreds of thousands are dead; perhaps five million, a third of the population, have fled to Pakistan and Iran. Yet resistance is unabated and so is the world's denunciation of an unwarranted attack on a nonaligned neighbor. The Soviet posture confirms an adage attributed to the Rev. William Inge, once Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral: ''A man may build himself a throne of bayonets, but he cannot sit on it.'' It's not Mr. Gorbachev's throne, not yet. He has made cautious moves toward extrication. He has installed a new leadership in Kabul, and is making overtures to non-Communist Afghan exiles. Soviet television no longer ignores the war, but even reports on casualties. And Soviet diplomats claim agreement on all but one element in a United Nations plan to bring about a Soviet withdrawal in exchange for an end to outside aid to the Afghan insurgents. The remaining snag is ostensibly the timetable. Moscow says it needs years to pull out its troops; Pakistan insists that only months are required. Yet the real obstacle, almost certainly, is Soviet unwillingness to see the triumph of an Islamic tribal insurgency over a Marxist client regime. At stake in Moscow's eyes is the Communist doctrine that the march of Soviet power is irreversible. But that doctrine, like the war, has unacknowledged roots in the czarist past. Under Alexander II (1855-81), Russia added 400,000 square miles of territory in Central Asia, as big as Western Europe. Over time the czars overwhelmed resistance, and in an imperial age, nobody cared. The difference now in Afghanistan is that much of the world does care. The test for Mr. Gorbachev, as it was for the United States in Vietnam, is whether he is prepared to lose, or risk losing. To acknowledge a blunder of such magnitude would have adverse repercussions for Soviet power at home and in Eastern Europe -though it also might open the way for a rapprochement with China. But carrying on is hardly more attractive. Short of Moscow's sending a million troops, the Afghan resistance is bound to continue. What's worse: the costs of admitting a huge mistake or of indefinitely bleeding the Soviet Union and an Islamic neighbor? If Mr. Gorbachev is big enough to scorn the latter course, he can bring this cruel war finally and mercifully to an end."
The New York Times, KCBS IS ACCUSED OF BIAS," A Hispanic coalition filed a Federal job-discrimination complaint Tuesday against KCBS-TV, accusing the station of racial bias in hiring and promoting on- and off-camera employees. The station denied any bias. The formal complaint to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeks imposition of an affirmative-action program at KCBS, said John Huerta, an attorney representing a group called the Hispanic Media Coalition. The commission would have to sue in Federal court if it decided there was merit to the accusations, Mr. Huerta said. Mr. Huerta said that of the station's about 400 employees, 14.2 percent were Hispanic. Mr. Huerta contended the percentage was far too low considering that 29 percent of the city's labor force is Hispanic. KCBS said it helps pay for a national computerized job bank for Hispanics. ''We are surprised that the group chose to target a station which not only has the best Hispanic employment record in the market, but has also been involved for several years in helping improve this situation nationally,'' said Tom Van Amburg, KCBS's vice president and general manager, in a written statement. Mr. Huerta said that the coalition had discussed minority hiring with station managers, but that the talks broke down in November when KCBS laid off about 20 workers, half of them minorities."
The New York Times, U.S. LIFTS OBSTACLE TO ROAD LEADING TO CARTER COMPLEX," A Federal district judge here has removed the last Federal obstacle to construction of a 2.4-mile-long highway that will provide easy access between downtown Atlanta and the Carter Presidential Center. He ruled that state highway officials had satisfied all environmental concerns. The decision by the judge, William C. O'Kelley, handed down last week, does nothing, however, to remove local opposition to the $22 million Presidential Parkway, nor does it lift an injunction imposed by the Georgia Supreme Court. Alva Byrom, an engineer in the State Highway Department, said that the Federal ruling ''obviously relieves us of any problems with the Federal Government.'' But highway officials will still have to get the Georgia court to lift its injunction if it is to proceed with condeming land for the road. The State Supreme Court ruled in November that the Highway Department could not condemn land under a television broadcast tower owned by Cox Communications because motorists could be endangered by falling ice, which sometimes forms on the tower's guy wires. Mr. Byrom said, ''We intend to finalize the right of way and settle with Cox, but I have no idea when that will be.'' Appeal Almost Certain An appeal of the Federal court decision by opponents of the parkway is almost certain. Sally Dorn, a lawyer and co-chairman of a neighborhood group opposed to the road, said: ''There is no question that the judge erred, it's just a matter of where. We clearly feel that the decision is an appealable order.'' Miss Dorn's group has snarled the state's construction efforts almost from the beginning. A bid for the parkway was let in November 1984, but opponents were able to get a temporary restraining order in February 1985. Although some bridge abutments were built, land was cleared and trees were felled, construction has been at a standstill ever since. Without the parkway, visitors must use residential streets to reach the center from downtown Atlanta. Despite the increased traffic, residents of the area around the center oppose the parkway because they say it would destroy public parks and the ambiance of historical neighborhoods. Except to say that the parkway is necessary, former President Jimmy Carter and officials of the 133,000-square-foot Carter Presidential Center, which was dedicated this fall, have avoided comment on the project. $25 Million Complex The former President hopes the $25 million complex will play an important role in promoting human rights and combating world hunger. The center consists of the Presidential Museum, the Jimmy Carter Library, Global 2000, the Carter Center of Emory University and the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation. The museum is the only part of the complex already accessible to the public. In the first two months of its operation, about 750 people a day visited it. That rate is less than half the pace projected by officials, who foresaw 600,000 annual visitors. That estimate assumed the parkway would be built. The library is to house 27 million documents from Mr. Carter's presidency. Frank Ranew, a spokesman for the center, said: ''The documents are being moved in and filed. By the end of January, the research center will open for use by scholars.'' Health and Agricultural Projects Global 2000's aim is to cultivate primary health care in underdeveloped countries and to initiate agricultural programs in starving nations. Mr. Ranew said Global 2000 programs wee under way in the Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana and Zimbabwe. The Carter Center of Emory University has nine fellows, all Emory University professors. ''It's designed for scholarly research in the area of human rights, peace in the Middle East, nuclear disarmament and the like,'' Mr. Ranew said. The Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation, the newest facet of the center, recently bestowed its first honor, a $100,000 prize to be shared by the Soviet dissident Yuri F. Orlov and Mutual Support Group, a human rights organization in Guatemala."
The New York Times, The Editorial Notebook; Naming You-Know-What," Every wordsmith in America has plundered the thesaurus in quest of a catchy term for you-know-what. Time calls it ''Iranscam,'' and The Economist favors ''Iranagua.'' A New Republic contest awarded the prize to ''Iranamok.'' Others put the emphasis on Latin America, proposing ''Contra-Diction,'' ''Contra Mundo'' and the inevitable ''Contragate.'' America's best-known Marine colonel is immortalized in ''Olliewood,'' ''Oliver's Twist'' and ''Ollie's Follies.'' Then there's the sniggering ''Deep Gloat'' and ''Gipperloo.'' All these nominations make good sport but poor titles. A look at history helps explain why. Generally speaking, tags for past fiascos fall into three categories: places, people and jargon. Examples of the first start with the South Sea Bubble (1720), a financial scandal that claimed fortunes and reputations in Georgian England. Teapot Dome (1924) was named after the Wyoming oilfields whose corrupt leasing forever tarred Warren Harding. Suez (1956) is synonymous with the collusive and aborted attempt by Britain, France and Israel to reclaim the Suez Canal and depose President Nasser of Egypt. Closer to home is the Bay of Pigs (1961), the swamp in Cuba that swallowed up John F. Kennedy's exile army - and, of course, Watergate (1972), the Potomac complex in which the Nixon scandal begin to twist, slowly, in the wind. People's names are as rich a source. France's Third Republic was nearly sundered by the Dreyfus Affair (1894), stirred by a military conspiracy to frame Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, on treason charges. In Britain, where scandals usually involve sexual misbehavior, the most celebrated bears the name of John Profumo (1963), a Minister of the Crown whose dalliances hurried the resignation of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Finally, there's bureaucratic shorthand, as in Abscam (1980), the F.B.I. sting operation in which agents in Arab garb offered bribes to susceptible members of Congress. The problem with trying to name the present White House crisis is that it involves too much geography and too many people for any single, easy label. Russell Baker proposes, in the Sherlockian spirit, ''The Poindexter Affair.'' Clever, but no cigar. Neither Doyle nor Roget's offer shorthand long enough. It remains, for short, the Iran-contra arms scandal."
The New York Times, LINK OF FAT TO BREAST CANCER DISPUTED," Low-fat diets, widely recommended as a means of preventing breast cancer, fail to protect women from this common killer, a major new study concludes. The finding means there is apparently no practical way for women to protect themselves from breast cancer, a disease that strikes one of every 11 American women. The researcher cautioned, however, that women who have already reduced their fat intake should not revert to a high-fat diet on the basis of these findings. ''Within this study, there is really no support for an association between dietary fat and breast cancer,'' said Dr. Walter C. Willett of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Willett's study, based on the eating habits of nearly 90,000 nurses, found that those on relatively high-fat diets had less breast cancer than those whose eating habits mirrored the low-fat recommendations of the National Cancer Institute and other organizations. Other Reasons to Avoid Fat However, Dr. Willett said, even if a low-fat diet does not stop breast cancer, avoiding fat is still wise because this can reduce the risk of heart disease. ''Furthermore, the possibility exists that a moderate reduction in fat may reduce the risk of cancer at sites other than the breast,'' he said. ''However, this remains to be established.'' He said an ''important implication'' of this finding was that alternative methods to reduce the risk of breast cancer must be found. He stressed the importance of routine breast self-examination and mammography, or X-rays of the breast, to detect the disease early. But ''at this point,'' he said, ''there is little that a woman can do to reduce her risk of breast cancer with any degree of confidence.'' Although some suggest that a more drastic reduction in fat consumption to 20 percent of total calories will prevent breast cancer, Dr. Willett said his study neither disproved nor supported that theory. Dr. Daniel Nixon of Emory University, a proponent of the diet cancer theory, said the new research ''flies in the face of animal studies,'' which show that dietary fat promotes breast cancer in laboratory animals. But he said the large size of the Harvard study made it ''hard to argue with.'' Contrary to Common Belief Dr. Willett's research, published in the latest issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, disputes an idea that has been widely repeated in recent years. The National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society and the National Academy of Sciences, among others, have recommended diets intended to ward off breast cancer and other forms of cancer. In general, they propose that women restrict their fat consumption to 30 percent of their total calories, rather than the more common 40 percent. Dietary fat has been implicated in other forms of cancer. In last week's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, two European studies provided circumstantial evidence that high-fat diets might contribute to colon cancer. In Dr. Willett's study, 89,538 nurses from around the United States kept track of their daily consumption of a variety of nutrients, including fat. After four years, 601 of them had got breast cancer. Those on low-fat diets were not spared the disease. In fact, those whose fat consumption averaged 44 percent of their daily calories had an 18 percent lower risk of cancer than did those who ate 32 percent of their calories as fat. However, this difference was not statistically meaningful. Not the Final Word Several experts said that the Harvard study was unlikely to be the last word on this issue. ''This is a good study, but it's not the only one,'' said Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of the cancer institute's division of cancer protection. He said the institute would continue to recommend that Americans cut back on fat and total calories while increasing their consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain cereals and starches. Dr. Johanna Dwyer of the New England Medical Center said, ''Maybe Dr. Willett feels he has annihilated the N.C.I. guidelines, but I think we'll have a lot of different studies before that happens.'' Dr. Willett said there appeared to be little a woman could do to reduce her risk of breast cancer. ''The best method is to have many children and have them early,'' he said. ''That, unfortunately, is impractical.'' An estimated 123,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 1986, and 40,200 women died from it. Among factors known to increase the risk of the disease are a family history of breast cancer, never having children or having a first child after the age of 30. Dr. Willett said no one knew why women in some parts of the world had a better chance of escaping breast cancer. However, he said, one explanation might be restriction of food intake in childhood or adolescence. Such food deprivation probably has to be severe enough to stunt children's growth. ''If that's true, it's in a way unfortunate, because it doesn't lead to any practical intervention,'' he said. ''We're certainly not going to hold back food from our kids so much that they'll grow shorter.''"
The New York Times, O'CONNOR SEES MIDEAST ROLE FOR VATICAN," John Cardinal O'Connor said today that he would probably suggest to Pope John Paul II and other Vatican officials that they consider taking the lead in calling an international conference to work out a Middle East peace settlement. In raising the proposal, the Cardinal, who is to travel to Israel on Thursday, was again taking a stand that is at odds with Israeli views of the Middle East situation. The Israelis have said they prefer direct negotiations between the parties disputing a given issue or piece of territory, although they have moved to acceptance of an international forum as a stage that would precede direct talks. Those Arab governments that have urged the convening of an international conference have usually suggested that either the five permanent members of the Security Council or only the United States and the Soviet Union sponsor such a conference. 'From a Moral Perspective' Papal sponsorship, the Cardinal said, could be seen as an alternative should the other approaches prove unworkable. However, he said he had not discussed the proposal with Vatican officials, whom he plans to see after completing his visit to Israel on Jan. 5. ''If Rome doesn't consider it a good idea, it will last a quarter of a second,'' he said. The Cardinal, who is the Archbishop of New York, said he was not making the proposal out of any expertise on the Middle East but because ''I think it's a good idea to bring participants in any conflict together.'' As with his calls for self-determination for the Palestinian people, he said he was ''attempting to answer questions from a moral perspective.'' The Cardinal's decision to visit Israel grew out of criticism by Israeli and American Jewish groups of remarks he made favoring the idea of a Palestinian homeland. Meetings Are Canceled A diplomatic controversy has arisen over his decision, under Vatican pressure, to cancel meetings with several high-ranking Israeli officials. The Vatican has indicated that it objects principally to the idea that the Cardinal was to hold the meetings in Jerusalem, which it does not recognize as Israel's capital. The Cardinal said the Vatican would be a fitting sponsor for an international conference because it is ''the one worldwide moral entity that might be seen as most objective, that has generally been seen as pursuing peace over the years.'' At a news conference concluding his three-and-a-half-day visit to Jordan, the Cardinal also repeatedly urged Americans to ''rid ourselves of stereotypes'' of Arabs and Palestinians as terrorists. ''This is a grossly distorted image of a deep and ancient culture,'' he said. ''There is a deep yearning for peace on the part of Arab countries.'' Still, he added, ''one cannot excuse those guilty of terrorist acts for helping to bring about this image.'' Good Will Toward Israelis The Cardinal's statement today followed several other assertions he has made while in Jordan that may not sit well with Israeli officials. The Cardinal's urging that self-determination be granted to the Palestinian people is a linguistic formula for Palestinian political rights that neither Israel nor the United States has accepted. He has also suggested that unless the Palestinian problem is solved soon, Middle East tensions could spill over into war within a year or two. Asked today whether his recent statements on the Palestinians would rub salt in Israeli wounds, he responded: ''It's always a possibility, but it was never intended. I have nothing but good will toward the Israeli people.'' But, he said, ''I must say what I believe'' and that ''doesn't cast any aspersions on the Israeli people.'' He compared his speaking out on the Palestinians to his statements expressing concern about homelessness in New York. In speaking out about the homeless crisis in New York, he said he was calling attention to a severe problem that demands correction, not blaming the Reagan, Cuomo or Koch administrations. Visits Refugee Centers Similarly, he said, there are ''hundreds of thousands of homeless people in Palestine'' living in refugee centers that he must speak out about without necessarily blaming Israel. The Cardinal's decision to display his sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians has been apparent from some of the stops he chose to make in Jordan. On Monday, he visited the Baqaa refugee center, a crowded and squalid place of more than 65,000 refugees displaced by the 1967 Mideast war. Today, he visited a clinic for pregnant women and new mothers and their children, whose clients are largely Palestinians from the Schneller refugee center in Amman. The clinic is run by the Pontifical Mission for Palestine, a Vatican agency to aid Palestinian refugees that is financed by an American group headed by the Cardinal. Dr. Mazin S. Hanna, the clinic's 36-year-old Palestinian doctor, told the Cardinal that there was much less malnutrition than years before but that because of sanitary conditions at the center many of the children he sees still suffer from diarrhea and frequent bacterial infections. Emerging from the clinic into a bright morning sun, the Cardinal said the visit had persuaded him that the Palestinian patients there ''are certainly not in any way masters of their own destiny.'' Asked why he was choosing to make so many strong statements about the plight of the Palestinians, the Cardinal said: ''Only because I'm here. I didn't come with any vision of doing this. When I get among a people like this, more thoughts come to my mind.'' When he gets to Israel, he said, ''I hope to demonstrate my balance.''"
The New York Times, American Petrofina Under Investigation," American Petrofina Inc., an oil and petrochemical company based in Dallas, is being investigated by the Energy Department for possible violations of former industry price and distribution regulations, an Energy Department spokesman confirmed today. The company, which could be required to pay penalties of $841.1 million, is accused of raising its crude oil prices above those allowed by Federal regulations in 1979 and 1980, according to an article today in The Dallas Morning News. The company was able to charge more than $359 million above allowed prices by transferring its oil through a number of companies and circumventing investigators, the report said. The article, which cited a copy of an internal Energy Department draft of a proposed remedial order, said that company employees had testified that Petrofina's chairman, Paul D. Meek, and other executives knew about the pricing scheme and had concealed the violations from Federal investigators. ''We understand that a review is under way, but no final decision has been made by the D.O.E. to bring any action against Fina,'' the company said today. The company has not been shown the draft of the preliminary order, according to a source at Petrofina, It declined to comment further pending the outcome of the review. Jack C. Vandenberg, a spokesman for the Energy Department in Washington, said officials from the Federal agency and the company met yesterday in Washington to discuss the investigation, which has been under way for more than a year. He said that the draft of the proposed order was an internal document and would not necessarily be issued in its current form, if at all. American Petrofina is an affiliate of Petrofina S.A., a Belgian company. COMPANY NEWS"
The New York Times, SHULTZ TO PRESS CONGRESS FOR INCREASE IN CURRENT FOREIGN AID BUDGET," The Reagan Administration has decided to press Congress for a 7.8 percent increase in its $16.6 billion foreign affairs budget - most of it for economic and military aid - for this year, and a modest rise in the next fiscal year, State Department officials said today. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who has complained publicly that sharp reductions by Congress in the foreign affairs budget had ''cut the legs right out from under us,'' has agreed to take the lead in the public relations effort for the $1.3 billion increase, officials said. The foreign affairs budget includes money allocated to foreign aid, international lending institutions, embassy protection and overseas radio broadcasting. A high department official acknowledged today that the new drive, which Mr. Shultz will open on Monday at a news conference, may include ''some unusual gimmicks.'' May Use a T-Shirt He said, for instance, that to get attention in coming weeks, Mr. Shultz was considering holding up a child's T-shirt with ''1987'' written on it and comparing his getting into the shirt with the difficulty of meeting the nation's national security obligations with a budget that makes it impossible. The Administration had originally sought $22 billion for its foreign affairs account in the current 1987 fiscal year, but Congress cut it to $16.6 billion. Because Israel and Egypt were guaranteed by Congress to receive $3 billion and $2.1 billion respectively, this has led to drastic cuts in funds for other nations. The alternative to such cuts would be for Congress to approve a supplemental request, which is to be announced on Monday. Also to be announced is the target of $19 billion for the overall foreign affairs budget for the 1988 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1. Because of the priority given to the campaign to increase the money available for foreign aid and other international programs, the State Department was permitted by the Office of Management and Budget to begin briefing key members of Congress and their staffs a week earlier than usual. The briefings have taken place this week. Reaction Not Encouraging But the initial reaction from Congress, State Department officials said, was not very encouraging. Congress, in cutting back on foreign aid this year, had made the point that it would listen to requests for raising the total only if the Administration proposed a tax increase to cover the additional costs or could show that the increase was offset elsewhere in the budget. ''It all depends on the nature of the offsets - otherwise the request is D.O.A.,'' a department official said, using the acronym for ''dead on arrival.'' A major reason for the supplemental request was to meet commitments to allies that permit rights for American bases, officials said. The request includes $50 million in military grants for the Philippines, doubling the amount previously allocated for 1987. It calls for $200 million in low-interest credits to Spain, in addition to the $105 million allocated already. Turkey would receive $125 million in military grants in addition to the $490 million approved in the regular 1987 allocation for grants and loans. Portugal would receive $30 million in grants above the previous $80 million. To Aid African Railroad In addition, the supplemental request includes $297 million in cash grants above the $3.55 billion previously approved. This includes $50 million to help South Africa's neighbors put into operation a railroad ending in Mozambique to avoid the need to use South Africa's ports. The supplemental request would also provide an additional grant of $200 million for Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The United States Information Agency would receive an additional $17.7 million, and the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty would receive nearly $25 million to cover the deficits caused by the decline of the dollar overseas. In the 1988 budget request, the Administration is seeking $500 million to cover a special fund for hunger relief in Africa, as well as an additional $100 million for the continent, for a total of $600 million, well above the $486 million now allocated. The military assistance being sought in 1988 amounts to $5.7 billion, an increase over the less than $5 billion approved in 1987, but less than the $6.6 billion originally requested for 1987."
The New York Times, Mark Liebl As a Free Man," He was born in Dodge City, Kan., and as a teen-ager drove a stagecoach for tourists around Boot Hill. It never occurred to Mark Liebl that he would grow up to be a real-life desperado. Or a bit of baseball trivia. Liebl is the man authorities tabbed as the kingpin in the first prosecution of a cocaine case involving a group of major league players. His frequent companions included many members of the 1983 Kansas City Royals, four of whom - Vida Blue, Willie Wilson, Willie Aikens and Jerry Martin -were ultimately imprisoned as a result of an investigation that centered on him. Except for Blue, who was sentenced for cocaine possession, the players all pleaded guity to reduced charges of attempts to possess, after calls they made to Liebl's house were intercepted by Federal agents. Blue, Wilson, Aikens and Martin served only 90 days each, plus brief suspensions from baseball, before resuming their careers. Liebl, who pleaded guilty of distribution, served nearly two and a half years in the Fort Worth Correctional Institute. He was released in October and is still feeling some wonder at the day-to-day pleasantries of life as a free man. ''Just being able to go running or swimming or buy a candy bar any time I feel like it,'' he told a caller yesterday, speaking of the moments he finds both thrilling and odd. ''All the little things you take for granted.'' Now 36, he feels only ''shame'' at his past as a drug supplier, but believes his arrest allowed him to survive his own cocaine addiction. His parole requires him to attend weekly drug counseling sessions and to submit to regular urinalysis, conditions he is happy to comply with. He spent his first free Christmas with his girlfriend in Arlington, Tex., where he now lives, and planned a quiet dinner for New Year's Eve. ''I'm not ready yet for all that traffic,'' he said. His arrest cost him his Kansas City liquor business and $25,000 in legal fees, but Liebl is hoping to open a restaurant soon. He is now working in his brother's furniture business. As for baseball, prison didn't cool his passion. ''I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of Ranger games this year,'' he said. ''But I'm still a Royals fan at heart, and always will be.'' Liebl has seen Aikens and Wilson once since getting out of prison and, far from being bitter at the difference in sentences, still calls them good friends. The conversations centered mostly on reminiscence. ''We talked about the past,'' he said, ''realized how we made mistakes. We all just said we want to continue on.''  SCOUTING"
The New York Times, PRICES PAID TO FARMERS DOWN 2.4%," The prices that farmers received for raw products in December were an average of 2.4 percent below November's levels, and ended 1986 down 5.5 percent from a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today. Department officials say the nation's farm income has generally stabilized and could show ''moderate growth'' in 1987. But the slide in farmland values was expected to continue, further eroding assets and reducing the borrowing power of farmers. The report said that lower prices for oranges, tomatoes, broilers, cattle, hogs and turkeys contributed most to the decline in the price index from its November level. Higher prices for cotton, strawberries, corn and lettuce helped soften the drop. No new figures were reported for the prices paid by farmers to meet expenses. The most recent average computed in October showed farm expenses running six-tenths of 1 percent below levels a year earlier. The next quarterly revision of that index is scheduled in January. Beef and Hog Prices Drop Changes in grain prices were mixed in December, the report said. Prices for beef cattle and hogs were down, but calf prices were higher. ''Average lamb prices were up sharply, but broiler and egg prices were down,'' the report said. ''The all-milk price was unchanged. Sharply lower prices for oranges and tomatoes were important factors in the month-to-month decrease of the commercial vegetable and all-fruit indexes.'' According to the preliminary December figures, based mostly on midmonth averages, prices of crops declined by an average of 2.9 percent from November and 16 percent from December 1985. Prices of commercial vegetables at the farm were down 14 percent from November and 28 from the period a year ago. Prices for sweet corn, onions, celery and carrots dropped, while prices for lettuce rose slightly. Fruit prices in December dropped 11 percent from November and were 2.3 percent below levels of a year earlier, primarily because of a sharp decline in the prices of oranges. Higher prices for strawberries and grapefruit partly offset the drop. Prices for feed grain and hay rose 1.3 percent from November but were down 29 percent from a year earlier. The price index for livestock and livestock products was down 2.8 percent from November but up 2.9 percent from December 1985. Net farm income is forecast by the Agriculture Department at about $28 billion this year, down from $30.5 billion in 1985. Economists are forecasting an increase to about $32 billion in 1987."
The New York Times, JORDANIAN SAYS HE EXPECTS FEW DETAILS ON IRAQI JET HIJACKING," A senior Jordanian official says he thinks few details are likely to emerge about who was behind the hijacking a week ago of an Iraqi airliner. The death toll, put at 67 by Iraq, was the highest in the history of air piracy. The official indicated that Jordan had agreed not to challenge what are apparently the wishes of Saudi Arabia and Iraq to suppress further details of the hijacking. There have been unconfirmed reports that dissident Iraqi security officials might have played a role in the commandeering of the plane. Jet Crashed in Saudi Arabia The Iraqi Airways Boeing 727, which was on a scheduled flight from Baghdad to Amman, crash-landed and blew up near a remote airfield in northern Saudi Arabia. Survivors said that hijackers exploded two grenades in the passenger cabin and that a gun fight broke out with security guards. All of the dead passengers were reported to have been from Arab and Moslem countries. Saudi Arabia has not even officially said that a hijacking attempt took place. It also declined to investigate the accident itself, as required under international aviation rules. Instead, Saudi Arabia sent survivors, the dead bodies and key parts of the plane to Baghdad at Iraq's request. Asked about the whereabouts of the plane's flight recorder, which records all activities in the pilot's cabin, the Jordanian official said he assumed the device had been sent to Baghdad. The ''black box'' is usually a key element in any airline accident investigation. No Word From Iraq The Iraqi authorities have also withheld information about the hijacking, beyond making public the names of the dead and saying they were citizens of Iraq, Jordan, the Sudan and Egypt. Most of the survivors are believed to be still in Baghdad. At first, the Jordanian authorities expressed anger with the withholding of information by Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Amman pressed them to reveal more about the incident and passed on what they already knew to Western reporters. In particular, Jordanian officials said they suspected that the hijackers had been helped in smuggling weapons aboard the plane through the Baghdad airport's tight security system by dissident elements in the police and that the hijackers might even have been dissident security guards themselves. But a high-ranking Jordanian official has now said that the Jordanian Government considers the matter closed and will say nothing more about it. Jordanian journalists said that local papers had been told by the Government to drop the story. The Jordanian official indicated that Amman did not want to embarrass President Saddam Hussein of Iraq further at a time when he is locked in a bitter six-year-old war with Iran. J Western diplomats in Amman say that Iraq and Saudi Arabia are able to hush up the hijacking incident only because no Americans or other Western citizens were involved. As a result, Western governments are not pressing for a full, public inquiry."
The New York Times, The Top Toes," It was a bad omen for the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday when, after they scored on their first possession against the Jets, Nick Lowery missed the point-after. Lowery had converted on his last 123 extra-point attempts, the second-longest active regular-season streak in the N.F.L. and not very far from inclusion on this list of the greatest such skeins in league history.

The New York Times, LOYALTY MOTIVATES LIONS LINEBACKER," He was reluctant to leave Penn State with an incomplete grade in football. Shane Conlan decided that to come so close to being part of the No. 1 team in the country last season, and then pass up a second chance, would be like a student quitting school only a few credits short of earning a degree. What's more, there was a matter of loyalty, no small consideration in this case. Conlan hears the Lion's roar more loudly than most at State College, Pa. The all-America linebacker has always appreciated that Penn State was the only school that actively recruited him five years ago when he was a raw-boned 185-pound defensive back from Frewsburg, N.Y., not a popular stopping point on the recruiting trail. ''I was getting upset at the time because there was no real solid recruitment,'' Conlan said. ''I was amazed that Penn State showed that much interest. They took the time to look, made the effort to watch game films.'' Conlan was red-shirted in his freshman year, 1982, when Penn State finished No. 1 for the first time. It was a year of transition. The coaches liked his aggressiveness, his lean and hungry look. He had the ability to cover a lot of ground. They sent him to the weight room, building him up into a linebacker without sacrificing quickness. Rated With the Best Conlan became one of the best at his position, as good as Oklahoma's Brian Bosworth, Joe Paterno, the Nittany Lions' coach believes, if not as well publicized. Conlan is expected to be a first-round pick in the National Football League draft, the latest in a succession of Penn State linebackers to be coveted by the pros. Conlan could have already been playing in the N.F.L. After Oklahoma spoiled Penn State's bid to finish No. 1 in the Orange Bowl last New Year's night, he was urged by his father, a New York State trooper, to pass up his final year of eligibility since his class was graduating. There appeared to be little to gain by returning to Penn State. ''But falling short last year made me want to come back,'' he said. ''And I'm glad I did.'' There were practical steps to take, however, such as protecting Conlan's potential worth as a professional football player. His parents took out a life insurance policy in their son's name this year, protecting him in case of injury in a high risk sport. Conlan was evasive about the amount of coverage or what it cost, saying he was insured for between $500,000 and $1 million. It cost his parents between $5,000 and $10,000, he said. It might be considered a wise investment. Conlan plays with a recklessness that belies his clean-cut look and polite manners. He has the square-jawed Clark Kent profile, neatly trimmed brown hair and an easy smile. He says he has become friendly with Vinny Testaverde, the Miami quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner, whom Conlan will be chasing on Friday night in the Fiesta Bowl, because they have similiar personalities. They met after being named to an all-America team. ''I've gotten to know Vinny really well,'' Conlan said. ''He's like me, confident, but humble.'' Sometimes Too Aggressive The team psychologist for the San Diego Chargers several years ago once characterized linebackers as having the personalities of assassins. Conlan, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 225 pounds, has disturbed Paterno on occasion because of his penchant for drawing unsportsmanlike penalties for being too aggressive. ''I play better when I'm mad,'' he said. ''I was so mad against Notre Dame, for instance, especially Steve Beuerlein.'' Conlan was angered when the Notre Dame quarterback said it would not be a big upset if his team defeated Penn State. ''I'm not mad at Miami, yet,'' Conlan said. ''But regardless of whether I'm friendly with Testaverde, I want to hit Vinny as hard as I can on Friday. I would feel that way even against my brother or mother.'' It is Penn State's ferocious tackling that worries Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach. He said his team depends on turning short passing plays into long gains by breaking tackles. Conlan said the Penn State defense brings realistic goals into the game. ''They are going to score,'' he said. ''Testaverde is a seasoned quarterback. It's not like they will put us in a magic defense and we'll sack him 10 times. ''But we have to slow them down, force some turnovers. If that means me moving around more, then fine. I like running around.''  FIESTA BOWL"
The New York Times, INLAND SAYS IT HAS NO DEAL YET," The Inland Steel Company said yesterday that it had not yet reached an agreement with the Nippon Steel Corporation of Japan to establish a joint venture in the United States to make sheet metal for use in automobiles. According to published reports in Japan, the companies had completed negotiations on the construction of a $400 million factory in the Middle West that would begin operating in late 1988, with an annual production capacity of at least a million tons. The reports added that Inland would have a 60 percent stake in the plant, with the balance controlled by Nippon Steel. The venture would be financed partly by the trading companies of Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Nissho Iwai, which would handle the steel sales to Japanese automobile plants, the reports said. An Inland spokesman, Charles A. Nekvasil, said that negotiations were continuing and that ''no deal has been presented to the board of directors.'' The spokesman added that the financing of the deal had not yet been worked out. ''Nothing has been set yet,'' he said. The Inland spokesman said the company was eager to reach an agreement, noting that the two companies had been negotiating for more than two years to build a continuous cold mill facility in this country. The spokesman said the plant would use technology developed by Nippon to produce the kind of smooth, high-quality steel that is eagerly sought by Detroit's auto makers. The spokesman said the plant would be patterned after a similar facility operated by Nippon Steel in Hirohota, Japan. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel company, has had domestic problems in recent months, a result of a strong yen, slumping exports and low domestic demand. Last week, the company announced that it was closing five of its twelve blast furnaces."
The New York Times, FIRST CHICAGO TO BUY DELAWARE BANK," Increasing its stake in the credit-card business, the First Chicago Corporation said today that it would buy the Beneficial National Bank in Wilmington, Del., from the Beneficial Corporation for $247 million. Analysts said the acquisition would make First Chicago, already the nation's fifth-largest issuer of credit cards, a more potent player. Currently, it has $3.4 billion in outstanding balances and three million card holders. Beneficial National, whose primary business is the issuance of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, is the 12th-largest card issuer. The move would also give First Chicago, which is incorporated in Delaware, its first operating unit in that state. 'Growth in a Big Step' ''They can achieve growth in a big step with this acquisition,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., who added that he expected Beneficial to contribute to First Chicago's earnings in ''a couple of years.'' For the Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance company, the sale would aid in its restructuring. Two weeks ago, the Delaware company said it would sell about $1.4 billion in assets. The announcement came after it was unable to negotiate a takeover agreement with an unidentified corporation, rumored to have been the Transamerica Corporation, for about $1.74 billion. Beneficial said it now plans to concentrate on its consumer lending operations. A spokesman for the company said proceeds from this sale and from the expected sale of its insurance operations would be used to refinance debt and to repurchase shares. Beneficial National is not considered a full service bank - defined as an institution that takes commercial deposits and makes consumer loans. Beneficial officials said the bank takes in commercial deposits, but does not make consumer loans. It only issues credit cards. Of the bank's total assets of $1.1 billion, about $1 billion are receivables on credit-card accounts. Regulatory Approval Expected Bank and industry analysts said they do not expect regulatory problems. Typically, a bank acquisition across state lines requires approval from state and Federal authorities. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates bank holding companies, said, ''Although we have to look at First Chicago's application, the subject is not without precedent.'' On the state level, the issue is a little more cloudy because the sale is subject to approval by Delaware officials. ''It would be premature to issue any reponse,'' said Susan I. Winters, deputy commissioner in the Office of the State Bank Commisioner of Delaware. First Chicago officials remained confident that they would receive regulatory approval and complete the deal by mid-1987. ''It is a credit-card business, which happens to be imbedded in a bank,'' said Leo F. Mullin, First Chicago's executive vice president of consumer banking."
The New York Times, 1986's CHARITABLE TAX RUSH," A surge in year-end charitable giving has taken place across the United States, as many donors rushed to make their gifts before the new tax law went into effect today. Colleges, universities and religious organizations generally report a marked increase in contributions; less so the arts. Most of the gifts were traditional -cash and securities. But others were unusual, ranging from Persian rugs to cases of wine. Indeed, in one instance, a majority interest in a vineyard was donated. A number of environmental groups also received substantial gifts of property. Many, but not all, of the benefiting organizations said contributors acted to get maximum benefits under the expiring tax code. In 1987, gifts from individuals and corporations to the country's 1 million nonprofit organizations will be subject to the new Tax Reform Act. The law affects charitable giving to educational institutions, libraries, hospitals, museums, religious organizations, welfare agencies and cultural groups. $11 Billion Loss Seen The Independent Sector - the country's largest philanthropic coalition - estimates that, under the new tax law, nonprofit organizations will lose at least $11 billion in charitable contributions annually. However, others dispute that estimate as unduly pessimistic. Many large nonprofit organizations, such as universities, depend on receiving from donors securities that have appreciated in value; the donors in the past have gotten sizable tax write-offs. But under the new law, the appreciated portion of such gifts will be subject to alternative minimum tax treatment for the first time. The coalition estimated this provision alone will mean $1 billion less for nonprofit organizations. Some wealthy donors have been fulfilling two- and three-year pledges ahead of schedule, according to Brian O'Connell, the coalition's president. Consequently, it will be much tougher to come near the same levels of giving in 1987 and 1988, he acknowledged. However, he also argued that although tax policies influence the size of gifts, donors will continue to give ''for all the right reasons.'' Traditionally, the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's is the busiest period for fund-raisers. In recent months, many buttressed their usual appeals by arguing the tax advantages of giving in 1986. Stanley S. Weithorn, a New York lawyer and tax adviser to both nonprofit groups and wealthy donors, also emphasized to clients that the old law applies to any gift mailed before midnight yesterday, even though it may be received by the beneficiary in 1987. 'The Most Generous Month' ''Columbia University is expecting December to be the most generous month in its history in terms of private donations,'' Norman S. Fink, deputy vice president for development and alumni relations, said recently. He estimated that $10 million in gifts would be received for December. The University began a five-year drive in 1982 to raise $500 million. Yale University received more than $11 million in December, more than double the amount of money received from individuals during December 1985. Many of the gifts were appreciated securities, and reflected the donors' interest in acting before the Dec. 31 deadline, according to Sue Dorn, associate vice president for development. Yale also received some nontraditional gifts, one of them 13 cases of wine valued between $30,000 and $40,000. The gift, from Mr. and Mrs. A. Abner Rosen of New York, is to be used - for official purposes - by Yale's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., a provision that insures the donor receives a full tax deduction, which would not be so if the wine was sold or auctioned. In California, Claremont McKenna College reported that the number of donors for 1986 is 46 percent ahead of 1985, even though the total of funds is down 15 percent. This suggests an increase of contributions from smaller non-itemizing taxpayers, who will no longer get a deduction for their charitable gifts under the new tax code, Jon Keates, vice president for development, said. The college has also received some nontraditional gifts, one of them an 80 percent interest in a 122-acre vineyard in the Sonoma Valley, valued, Mr. Keates said, in the ''half-million range.'' Cultural organizations were more cautious in reporting their year-end contributions. 'We've Had Nice Support' ''We've had nice support, not as dramatic as it might have been, but above last year's year-end contributions,'' said Joe McKoughan, vice president for public affairs at Lincoln Center Inc. It is difficult for arts groups to ''try to keep up with our brothers and sisters in the education field, '' said Milton Rhodes, president of the American Council for the Arts. The council's 2,900 members include orchestras, museums, opera and dance companies and theater groups. Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolian Museum of Art, said, ''I cannot say there is an unusual surge compared with last year, but it is a good year.'' Albert K. Webster, executive vice president and managing director of the New York Philharmonic, said, ''If the national trend is increased philanthropy, I'm disappointed the world of arts doesn't have a higher priority.'' He added that orchestras are generally ''holding their own, but obviously donors are making choices, and we all know education and religion have high priorities.'' Gifts to religious organizations tend to increase toward the end of the year, and Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York is running about a half-million dollars ahead of 1985, according to Msgr. James J. Murray, executive director. Some of the contributions are made as appreciated securities. ''The tax law has had some influence on the increased contributions, but the giving also reflects people's concern for others, and particularly the more visible homeless,'' he said. A 20 Percent Increase Fund raising for the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York is running about 20 percent ahead of last year's drive, Stephen Solender, executive vice president, said. He stated: ''We expected to achieve this level, and if we had achieved a significantly higher level, it would have confirmed that the new tax law was leading people to give, before Dec. 31, the contributions they would have spread out over future years. Our experience suggests that predictions about the negative impact of the law, which were made four or five months ago, were probably overstated. The New York Public Library is having a ''tremendous'' volume in gifts, according to Vartan Gregorian, its president, but he attributed the increase to the library's five-year fund-raising drive, not the tax law. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has received more end-of-the-year gifts than in prior years, particularly in the form of appreciated securities, Mortimer H. Chute, vice president for development, said. The center also received two unusual gifts. One was a 117-acre estate in the rolling countryside of Flemington, N.J., valued at $2.9 million, and the other a 17th-century Persian carpet, valued at $175,000. The New York Community Trust, one of the country's wealthiest foundations, opened up a record number of 100 new charitable funds for donors, Herbert B. West, the director, said. He said some were initial gifts to be augmented in future and were made by tax lawyers and investors ''who really know the business.'' 'Heavy Tax Weather' But the altered tax code could mean difficulties for newer community foundations, according to Thomas A.Troyer, a Washington lawyer and consultant to the Council on Foundations. Such foundations depend on gifts of appreciated property. ''The coming year will see heavy tax weather for a range of small community foundations starting up around the country,'' he said. The Nature Conservancy, the land-acquisition arm for the country's environmental movement, is experiencing a ''tremendous increase'' in gifts of appreciated properties and securities, according to John Jensen, vice president for development. He said the contributions undoubtedly were a result of the tax changes. United Way pledges, made mainly through payroll deductions, are not expected to be affected by the tax code change, according to Jack Moskowitz, a senior vice president, estimating that pledges paid out in 1987 would be about 6 to 8 percent above the $2.3 billion received last year.  WHAT THE NEW LAW COULD COST CHARITIES  The three tax changes that affect charitable giving and how much each is estimated to cost charities in 1988. Change Cost Cut in marginal tax rates $4.98 billion Loss of non-itemizer deduction $4.97 billion Appreciated property subject to minimum tax $0.99 billion Total $10.94 billion AND THE AREAS MOST AFFECTED  Areas of charitable giving expected to have biggest losses. Educational and cultural institutions, which depend heavily on high-bracket donors and gifts of appreciated property, are expected to be hardest hit. Charitable Expected Area Loss (%) Education -16.5% Culture -16.5 Social services -15.5 Health care -15.5 Religion -12.9 Other causes -14.3 All areas -14.3% (Source: Independent Sector)"
The New York Times, Trump's Bally Bid Is Delayed," The Justice Department has asked the real estate developer Donald J. Trump to provide it with additional information before it would allow him to proceed with his purchases of Bally Manufacturing Corporation shares. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Trump said that the Justice Department's antitrust division had requested additional information and documents, ''including information concerning Mr. Trump's present and proposed Atlantic City casino operations.'' Mr. Trump owns two hotel-casinos in Atlantic City. The Chicago-based Bally owns three MGM Grand hotel-casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., Reno and Atlantic City. The request for information would automatically delay the expiration of the waiting period under the antitrust laws for another 20 days from the receipt of the materials by the Justice Department, according to the filing."
The New York Times, Funds Up; C.D.'s Rise," Yields on money market mutual funds continued to move higher in the week ended yesterday, fueled by a surge in the Federal funds rate, which is the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans. The impact of short-term borrowings has had minimal effect on yields offered by banks and thrift institutions for certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Rates on repurchase agreements, short-term loans backed by government securities, have been influenced by the Federal funds rate, which in turn has exerted upward pressure on yields of money market mutual funds. Repurchase agreements are a common practice among large investing institutions, banks and securities dealers. At the Treasury's weekly bill auction, the average discount rate for a three-month bill rose one basis point, to 5.68 percent, its highest level since last August. Six-month bills increased by 12 basis points, also to 5.68 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed the average yield for a six-month certificate of deposit up two basis points, to 5.92 percent, and the average yield of a bank money market account, which competes with money market mutual funds, unchanged at 5.44 percent. One-Year C.D. at 6.17% Yields on one-year and five-year C.D.'s were up one basis point, to 6.17 percent and 7.15 percent, respectively. The average yield for a two-and-a-half year C.D. was up two basis points, to 6.61 percent. In the funds market this week, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said, the seven-day taxable, compounded average yield for money market mutual funds increased by 10 basis points, to 5.63 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield rose 6 basis points, to 5.48 percent. Analysts said the rise in yields may not last more than a week or two, at the most. The average maturity of securities held by the money market funds fell to 48 days, from 50 days, as portfolio managers apparently shortened maturities to take advantage of the higher rates.

Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., acquired its Esquire Health and Fitness Clinic, which publishes a magazine-on-the-wall for health clubs. And the shareholders of the Esquire Magazine Group will continue to own the company's Esquire Press, its book publishing division, and Esquire Video. Phillip Moffitt, editor in chief and president of the Esquire group, said financial terms of the deals would not be made public. He said he would become an editorial consultant to both Hearst and American Express Publishing for an interim period. Rumors that Hearst would buy Esquire magazine had been circulating for several weeks. But it had not been apparent that Mr. Moffitt would almost completely relinquish his involvement in the communications empire that he and his erstwhile partner, Christopher Whittle, had carved out in the last 10 years. Plans to Write In a telephone interview, Mr. Moffitt said he had decided in November to sell the company to devote his efforts to writing full time. ''I've always wanted to write full time,'' he said. ''I felt that I had achieved almost every goal I had set for myself in magazine publishing, but this other thing so nagged at me that it finally reached the point where I said to myself that if I was ever to give myself over to it, I had to do it now.'' Mr. Moffitt said the Esquire group had been pursued for years, but that the sale was expedited to beat the new tax law that takes effect today. All the transactions took effect as of yesterday. All 150 of the Esquire group's employees will continue to work at the New York offices and at regional sales offices in Chicago, Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles under the new managements. Wilma Jordan, the Esquire group's chief operating officer, will be a consultant to Hearst on Esquire for the next three months. 'Bonus Pool' Set Up Mr. Moffitt said that the corporation's selling shareholders, with their profits from the transactions, had established a ''bonus pool'' of more than $1 million for distribution to all employees who are not shareholders. ''It's just to say thanks for having made Esquire a high-spirited, fun place to work,'' Mr. Moffitt said. Industry analysts noted that Hearst owns several magazines oriented toward male readers, including Popular Mechanics, Boating and Sports Afield, although most of its magazines, including Town & Country, Cosmopolitan and Harper's Bazaar, are aimed at women. Seventy percent of Esquire's readers are men, mainly between the ages of 25 and 44. But the magazine has been seeking a slightly older audience. Ad Pages Decline Esquire estimates that it will carry 1,300 pages of advertising this year, down 7 percent from last year. It has a circulation of 700,000. Esquire was originally owned by the 13-30 Corporation, then headed by Mr. Moffitt and Mr. Whittle. But they split up last April and divided their assets into two separate corporations: Whittle Communications and the Esquire Magazines Group Inc. Whittle Communications has 25 media properties, including single-sponsor publications, newsletters, and ''magazines-on-the-wall,'' which consist of small-scale billboards in schools and offices that are frequently changed. Thomas O. Ryder, president of American Express Publishing, said the purchase of New York Woman fits the company's intention to reach more affluent women in urban areas, which is the publication's target readership. In a separate industry development, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced that it had sold its Games magazine, which offers puzzles and mind benders, to an investor group that includes the publication's publisher. Jerry Calabrese, Hershel Sarbin, former president of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, and Victor H. Palmieri, the financier. No terms of the sale were released.

The New York Times," CHAMPAGNE, POMEGRANATES AND OTHER SPLENDORS"," Last weekend a small fleet of trucks pulled into Moscow and unloaded an eye-popping cornucopia at the city's winter-bare markets: fat black grapes, ripe persimmons and pomegranates, watermelons and mandarin oranges, tomatoes and cucumbers, smoked chicken and fish. At subway stops around the city, farmers from Georgia, Kirghizia and Uzbekistan peddled exotic pastries for the New Year celebration, or passed steaming skewers of shashlik into the gloved hands of bundled Muscovites. ''Lord,'' muttered a wide-eyed woman surveying an extraordinary array of sausages at the Central Farmers' Market on Tsvetnoi Boulevard. Nearby, a saleswoman battered apart blocks of frozen geese with an ax. Just as Americans know an election is approaching when city services suddenly become more courteous and efficient, so Muscovites sensed that something was afoot. 'Initiative' Is the Byword Sure enough, the official press explained, Moscow was witnessing a splendid demonstration of the newest Soviet economic slogan, ''initiative.'' The three-day glut was organized under a Government decree, issued earlier this year, that allows collective farms to take a part of their produce to market on their own and sell it for whatever prices the traffic will bear. Normally, the average Soviet grocery shopper has two choices. He can buy from the Government shops, where goods are sold at low, fixed prices but where the selection, at least in the dead of winter, is meager. Or he can buy from the collective farmers who offer a greater variety of food grown on their private plots adjoining the collective farms where they work. The farmers often have meats, homemade pickles, and enticing fruit, but at stiff prices. Motivating the Farmer The new directive was designed to give farmers an incentive to get more fruit and vegetables to market from the collective farms themselves -items that might normally rot on the farm because of the Government's inadequate distribution system. Under the new policy, the collective farms are allowed to sell 30 percent of their produce at whatever prices the traffic will bear, and to keep the proceeds for projects on the farm. Getting the additional groceries to the cities, the Government reasons, will shorten lines at Government stores, and provide some competition to drive down the farmers' prices. Moscow tested the system in the fall, in food fairs set up before the Revolution Day holiday on Nov. 7. The event was proclaimed a success, and the fairs were reopened for three days last weekend on a grander scale. Muscovites are also finding it a little easier to fill their glasses this season for holiday toasts. Liquor stores, their hours curtailed as part of the campaign against drunkenness, now stay open an hour later, and Sunday hours have been resumed. For those who can do without wine or vodka, Moscow is awash in champagne. Even as the Government was reporting last week that vodka and wine sales had been curtailed by higher prices and shorter hours, sales of sparkling wine, both Hungarian imports and the sweetish bubbly from domestic factories, have remained constant, 212 million bottles in the first 11 months of 1986. Recently the Government began permitting sales of sparkling wine in grocery stores and fruit juice bars. ''Initiative'' has so far not brought even temporary relief to other consumer items, judging by the grumpy crowds lined up to buy New Year's gifts in department stores. At Detsky Mir, the children's department store, aisles were congested and the mood was anything but festive. The wait for toy trains appeared to be at least two hours, not counting a separate trip to the cashier to pay for it, and a return to claim the purchase. In the cavernous Victorian halls of the GUM department store, by far the biggest draw was a newly arrived supply of blank Sony cassettes. The line snaked 100 yards through the store to purchase the cassettes at $13.50 apiece. The Soviet Union is second in the world in electricity production, but it seems to invest little of that in lighting. This is a city of 60-watt bulbs, dimly lit streets, and drivers who refuse to use their headlights. The New Year's holiday is a glorious exception. Flickering colored lights are affixed to lampposts in the shapes of torches or snowflakes, buildings are outlined in yellow lights, and one of the electronic billboards normally devoted to political slogans now portrays a figure suspiciously like Santa Claus. Not really Santa Claus, of course. During the first 20 years after the 1917 Revolution, the observance of Christmas was abolished, but many of the trappings were transferred to the New Year's holiday. Thus Grandfather Frost, a jolly old soul in a red suit and white beard, somewhat more slender than the American Santa Claus, brings gifts for children on New Year's Eve. Store windows are festooned with tinsel and cardboard snowmen, and New Year's trees are trimmed with plastic balls and edible ornaments. Near Red Square, giant fir trees have been strung with colored lights and tinsel, and topped with a red star that is clearly not intended to represent Bethlehem's. MOSCOW JOURNAL"
The New York Times," John Harbeson, 98, Architect And Monuments Consultant"," John F.

The New York Times, State Move on Banks' Underwriting," The New York State Banking Department said yesterday that it might provide specific guidelines as early as next week on how banks chartered in the state may legally underwrite securities, an activity generally prohibited by the Federal Reserve. On Tuesday, the Banking Department concluded that subsidiaries of state-chartered banks may legally conduct up to to 25 percent of their ''business activities'' in securities underwriting. The action was in response to a request from the Bankers Trust New York Corporation and J. P. Morgan & Company to interpret existing New York State law. Although the department's interpretation left a number of questions, it nonetheless gave state-chartered banks - such as the Bankers Trust Company and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which are the bank subsidiaries of the Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan holding companies - far broader securities powers than they have previously enjoyed. And it set the stage for a regulatory tug-of-war between the State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board. Glass-Steagall Act In interpreting the Glass-Steagall Act, a Federal law that separates commercial banking from securities underwriting, the Fed has essentially forbidden banks to underwrite most securities. Yet both the State Banking Department and the Fed claim jurisdiction over Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan. The Fed regulates the subsidiaries of bank holding companies; the State Banking Department claims authority over banks chartered in New York. At the Fed, Joseph Coyne, a spokesman, said lawyers had not received a copy of the state's interpretation and would have no comment. According to David Halvorson, the Banking Department's deputy superintendent, the department's board members could offer as early as their next meeting, next Thursday, ''prudential guidelines'' on how the securities subsidiaries of the state-chartered banks will have to operate. Although a regulatory clash seems likely, it is not certain. For one thing, both Morgan and Bankers Trust have applied to the Fed to underwrite securities through subsidiaries of their holding companies as opposed to through subsidiaries of their banks. They may decide to defer establishing any underwriting units until the Fed issues a ruling. Additionally, taking advantage of the loophole in New York would mean alienating Fed officials, something the banks might not want to do. A spokesman, John Morris, declined to say what Morgan's next step would be, other than to say that its lawyers were mapping strategy. George Fasel, a Bankers Trust spokesman, said Bankers would probably wait until the Fed gave further guidance on banks' securities powers before setting up any securities operation in New York.  FED SETS HEARING FOR BANKS WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Special to The New York Times) - The Federal Reserve Board announced today that it had scheduled a public hearing on the requests by Citicorp, J. P. Morgan and Bankers Trust for authority to underwrite and issue commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, industrial revenue bonds and other consumer-related debt securities through wholly owned subsidiaries. A spokesman for the Fed said the rare public hearing before the Fed's board of governors would be held on Feb. 3, and on Feb. 5 if a second day was necessary."
The New York Times, SUSPECT IS NAMED IN MURDER OF SON OF EX-AIDE TO CUOMO," After 13 months of investigations, the Suffolk County police and prosecutors have named a suspect in the murder of John Starkey, a 25-year-old student who is the son of a former aide to Governor Cuomo. Mr. Starkey was found shot to death on Nov. 9, 1985, at his parents' gray-shingled cottage in the exclusive resort community of Saltaire on Fire Island. In court papers filed Tuesday, Steven J. Wilutis, the chief prosecutor for the Suffolk County District Attorney's office, charged that the suspect, Anthony Romeo of Locust Valley, L.I., ''has committed the crime of murder and that his revolver was the murder weapon.'' No motive was cited in the court papers. Mr. Romeo has so far not been arrested or formally indicted. His lawyer, Steven Scaring, has instructed him not to speak about the case. Mr. Scaring said today that his client had ''absolutely'' no involvement in the murder. Hair Samples Sought The prosecutor, Mr. Wilutis, asked the court to order Mr. Romeo to provide samples of his hair and blood for examination by police laboratory investigators. Mr. Starkey was found ''clutching 12 brown head hairs,'' the roots of which showed traces of blood, according to Mr. Wilutis. An affidavit filed by a homicide detective, Sgt. Robert Misegades, said it was ''reasonable to assume'' that Mr. Starkey ''grabbed the hair of the person who shot him or someone else within arm's reach of him just before, during or immediately after he was shot.'' Mr. Wilutis told the court that if laboratory analysis of Mr. Romeo's hair and blood matched that caught in Mr. Starkey's grip, it would indicate that he had been present during the murder. Mr. Scaring has told the police they should have ''no further contact whatsoever'' with his client and he said today that he would probably oppose the motion requesting hair and blood samples. A County Court judge is to issue a decision on Jan. 12. Fired at Close Range According to the affidavit submitted by Sergeant Misegades, Mr. Starkey was killed by four .38-caliber bullets fired at close range. Mr. Romeo possessed a pistol permit for a .357-Magnum Smith & Wesson revolver, which is capable of firing .38-caliber bullets, Mr. Wilutis said. ''Microscopic examination and comparison'' of that revolver revealed that the bullets that caused Mr. Starkey's death ''were fired from Romeo's revolver,'' he added. Tests by police laboratory technicians also found traces of Mr. Starkey's blood under the grip of the weapon, he said. The police came into possession of the revolver last July 31, when Mr. Romeo's father, Ronald, surrendered it to Nassau police officials, explaining that he ''did not believe that Anthony had the emotional capacity to have guns around the house,'' Mr. Wilutis told the court. When told of these charges, Mr. Scaring said: ''Why has it taken them so many months to come up with these results? Ballistics tests don't take that long.'' The Starkey killing profoundly shocked Saltaire, the summer home of many wealthy and well-known people. Mr. Starkey's father, Richard J. Starkey, is a friend and former aide to Governor Cuomo. A Buried Deer Several aspects of the case remain unexplained. For example, 10 days after the discovery of Mr. Starkey's body, a deer was found buried behind a neighbor's house. The bullets that killed the deer also came from Mr. Romeo's gun, the police now charge, but why the deer might have been killed was unclear. Based on testimony from a neighbor who heard shots fired, the police believe the deer was slain on Oct. 30 or 31. According to affidavits filed by Mr. Wilutis and Sergeant Misegades, Mr. Romeo has given conflicting testimony about his whereabouts at the time of the murder. In the days just before the body was discovered, Mr. Starkey's mother, Elizabeth, telephoned Mr. Romeo to ask whether he had seen her son, according to the court documents. At first, Mr. Romeo denied that he had seen him. Later, however, he said he had been with Mr. Starkey on Fire Island, the documents state. Mr. Romeo told detectives that he visited Fire Island in October and November, but contended that his guns had been safely locked away in Locust Valley then. Mr. Scaring said his client ''was not on Fire Island at the time of the murder, which the lawyer said ''took place at least two days after he left.'' Mr. Romeo is 22 or 23 years old and ''employed, though I don't know in exactly what capacity,'' Mr. Scaring said. ''He lives with his parents.''"

The New York Times," Preservation, With a Profit"," WALTER BEINECKE JR. gave himself and his family a $50 million Christmas present this year, when he sold a major portion of the town of Nantucket, Mass., to the First Winthrop Corporation. Mr. Beinecke had spent the last 25 years redeveloping the town to keep it from self-destructing. Along with his father, Mr. Beinecke had helped organize Nantucket's preservation movement in the 1950's, to save the island's Greek Revival mansions and other landmark buildings. His interest in historic properties eventually led him to the board of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Beginning in the early 1960's, the partnership he managed, Sherburne Associates, bought up much of the rundown waterfront of the old whaling community on the chip of land 30 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean, then fixed it up, building by building, filling in the holes with 18th-century reproductions. ''If we had taken this beautiful place and allowed the same kind of beachfront motels and pizza parlors that visitors could find on the mainland, there would have been no reason for them to come the 30 miles out here,'' Mr. Beinecke said yesterday. But he was never interested in preservation of historic architecture for preservation's sake. He always intended to make a profit - even if it took him a couple of decades to do it. On Christmas Eve, he sold the holdings of the family partnership -160 buildings, including two hotels, the Nantucket Boat Basin, 36 retail buildings and 40 cottages. The Beinecke partnership had accumulated the properties gradually, renovating them a few at a time. The partners took advantage of tax rules on depreciation and historic preservation to help shelter income from other businesses. ''In the early years, there was no way to justify the investment based on the returns the properties were generating,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''But we assumed we were building capital value as the years wore on, and as the economy of the island began to revive.'' The revival came slowly. After a century as a whaling port, Nantucket fell into a 100-year depression after a fire burned the town in 1846, Mr. Beinecke said. Then, after World War II, tourists began to find their way to the remote island. ''The question was whether to provide for it in a way that would save what was worth seeing in Nantucket, or just let the growth happen,'' he said. Even after his family had become the largest landholders on the island, Mr. Beinecke often found himself arguing before the local preservation organization for greater restrictions on development. He often contributed money to groups attempting to buy up vacant land to block development. Such a strategy helped make existing properties - including the Beineckes' - more valuable, but it also tended to limit the freedom, and sometimes the income, of shopowners and developers. Mr. Beinecke also used his control of the commercial real estate of the island to moderate the traffic. He refused to allow one ferry boat to land at his marina, the only one on the island, when the ferry operator declined to reduce the number of passengers he was bringing each day. Rents in the shops on the rejuvenated piers soared tenfold, to $6,500 a month, but the customers came and the island's economy boomed. Still, as a real estate company, Sherburne was less than a runaway success. ''It was never a free-standing business,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''Our principal business was Christmas Club A Corporation, which organized savings clubs for banks. We used the depreciation and other tax-related benefits to offset some of the profits from that business.'' The only way to realize the increased value of the properties was to sell them, but after playing such a large roll in the revival of the town's economy, the Beineckes were reluctant to let go. ''There was a strong element of family pride,'' Mr. Beinecke said. ''We wanted to find someone who would manage them with the same concern as we had for maintaining the standards of design and quality.'' Not until November did First Winthrop learn that the properties might be available. The Beineckes had already gone to contract with another buyer, but then that deal fell through. ''We were prepared to act quickly,'' said Jeffrey D. Furber, an assistant vice president at Winthrop Financial Associates, the umbrella partnership over First Winthrop. ''The Beineckes were eager to complete the sale before the tax rates went up at the end of the year, and we were already acquainted with the properties.'' First Winthrop holds more than $5 billion of real estate around the country and employs 450 people. Among the company's largest holdings are a group of 19 buildings in New York City purchased from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago in 1984. Those buildings include the Gulf and Western building at Columbus Circle and commercial buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues. After meetings in Boston, New York and Nantucket between Mr. Beinecke and Arthur Halleran Jr., chairman of First Winthrop, the deal was sealed. ''Mr. Beinecke was looking for a buyer who would hold the properties as a group, not sell them off piece by piece to help pay for the acquisition,'' Mr. Furber said. ''That fit our strategy perfectly. Our view is that if you buy and hold real estate that cannot be duplicated, you will eventually make money.'' Buying and holding worked for the Beineckes. Said Mr. Beinecke, ''Whether by the grace of God or inflation, we managed to make a profit in the end.''  TALKING DEALS"
The New York Times, Good Counsel for New York City," When Mayor Koch needed a high-caliber Corporation Counsel for his second administration, he didn't have to look far. F.A.O. Schwarz Jr., a partner in a large law firm, was already deep in public interest litigation, suing the Census Bureau on the city's behalf. It was easy for Mr. Schwarz to apply his impressive energy full time to the city's top legal job. He now returns to private practice, having earned the gratitude of New Yorkers for five years of distinguished service as the city's chief lawyer. That Census lawsuit, still pending, is characteristically creative. It challenges the loss of Federal aid based on a Census known to have undercounted urban minorities. Since taking office, Mr. Schwarz has pressed the Reagan Administration to account for its illegal cuts in disability benefits for New Yorkers on Social Security, an initiative that brought a resounding 9-to-0 Supreme Court victory last year. His aggressive litigation program attracted many bright young lawyers who accepted low wages for the privilege of working with him. Mr. Schwarz met the challenges of his office from potholes to human rights. He worked for fair ways to ease the city's liability for citizen injuries and sought more consistent tax policy toward charitable organizations. He defended hiring programs for minorities and victims of bias against homosexuals, sometimes winning in the Legislature what he couldn't win in court. At a time of widespread panic over acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he helped design and courageously defended in court a sound, humanitarian policy of including AIDS victims in city classrooms. Possibly Mr. Schwarz's best work came in response to the city corruption disclosures of the last year. He saw them as an opportunity to reform a sick political system. While guiding change in city contracting procedures, he kept hammering away at uncontrolled political giving, loose ethics and lobbying laws, the appearance of political favoritism. The City Council could now give proper recognition to his service by enacting his proposal to deny discretionary benefits to anyone who contributes more than $3,000 to city officials. Fritz Schwarz, great-grandson of the toy company founder, served the nation well a decade ago as counsel to the Senate committee investigating intelligence abuses. In New York, he has raised aspirations and performance in city government and made City Hall cleaner and livelier. It's a contribution to be prized, for its content and for its example."
The New York Times, STOCKS: UP YEAR ENDS ON DOWN NOTE," The stock market finished a banner year yesterday on a weak note. The Dow Jones industrial average showed a gain of 349.14 points - or 22.6 percent - over the year. It reached an all-time peak of 1,955.57 on Dec. 2, when it soared 43.03 points, the third-largest gain in the indicator's history. Yesterdy was another story, with the Dow falling 12.66 points, to slip below 1,900, at 1,895.95. That was the lowest point since Nov. 21, when it stood at 1,893.56. Analysts attributed yesterday's disappointing performance to tax-related selling and continued worries about the economy. ''There was a lot of tax-selling, the little folks who waited until the last minute to take their capital gains,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst at the A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. securities firm in St. Louis. Under new tax regulations that take effect today, capital gains will be taxed at higher rates than under the current law. Dollar Continues to Fall Meanwhile, the dollar continued to fall sharply on world currency markets, encouraging fears of resurgent inflation and concern that the Federal Reserve would not be lowering interest rates soon. ''Nineteen eighty-six started with a bang,'' said Gene Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal Inc. ''A rise from the January low of 1,491 to the March 1,850 high - a 24 percent straight line advance - was the best gain of the year, before the market's momentum stalled with April's Libya bombing.'' Mr. Seagle said the market kept within a basic trading range between 1,740 and 1,920 as it was buffeted by the Levine and Boesky affairs along with the Reagan Adminsitration's Iranian and Nicaraguan crises. He said that the 14 percent rally by the Dow from September to December lifted it to a new intra-day high of 1,970, exceeding the 1,955.57 record for a day's close. Analysts said that 1987, with the new tax program and the addition to option buying and selling negated the usual year-end upswing, which was reflected in yesterday's pre-holiday weakness. They added that there was some reason for optimism next year. ''Nineteen eighty-seven looks like a big year for the bulls,'' Mr. Seagle said. ''It should be remembered that the third year of any Administration has not been a 'downer' since 1939.'' ''The year's high point of the program-trading phenomenon on the stock market was reflected in the 86.61-point drop on the Dow on Sept. 11,'' Mr. Seagle said. ''Buy and sell programs have brought instability and insecurtiy to the marketplace.'' Declines on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday led advances by 842 to 799 as volume rose to 139.2 million shares, from 126.2 million shares on Tuesday. Broader-Based Indicators Broader-based indicators than the Dow showed fractional drops. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.20 points, to 242.17, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index edged down 0.54, to 138.58. Among individual issues, BellSouth led the New York Stock Exchange most-active list, down 3/8, to 57 3/4, on a volume of more than 6.4 million shares. Most other issues among the actives showed only fractional gains or losses. Bigger point decliners among the blue chips were Merck, which fell 2 1/4, to 123 7/8; General Motors H, which fell 2 1/8, to 38 5/8; Digital Equipment, which fell 1 3/8, to 104 3/4, and G.E., which lost a point, to 86. In economic news, New York gold futures for February delivery jumped $14.50 to end at $406.90 an ounce. The action in gold also reflected the revival of inflation concerns with the jump in oil prices. Also, spot February crude oil climbed 29 cents a barrel, to $17.94, and spot trading reached as high as $18 for the first time in 11 months. In response to the move in gold prices, shares of mining companies advanced across the board. ASA Ltd. rose 2, to 37 1/2; Dome Mines 3/8, to 7 3/4; Homestake Mining 1 3/8, to 25 3/8; Newmont Mining 1 3/4, to 61 1/2, and Campbell Red Lake 1, to 19 5/8. Prices were higher on the American Stock Exchange. The Amex market value index managed a 1.73-point gain, to 263.27, as advances rebounded to overtake declines by 395 to 274. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.51, to 348.83."
The New York Times," 2 OFFICERS SENT TO BAR HOLDUP, ROBBED OF GUNS"," Two police officers responding to a reported robbery at a Brooklyn tavern early yesterday were themselves held up by the robbers, who took their revolvers and herded them into a back room with patrons, the police said. One officer had a gun put to his neck as soon as he opened the door, while the other was grabbed from behind and forced to the ground before she entered the bar, said Capt. Michael Julian, a police spokesman. The robbers - the police said there were four - took cash, credit cards and jewelry from the the 16 people in the bar and $1,500 from the cash register. They fled in a car. Two Suspects Captured Two suspects were caught an hour later when the police tracked down a license plate on the double-parked getaway car, but two other suspects remained at large, said Police Officer Peter O'Donnell, another spokesman. Captain Julian said there were ''indications some tactical errors were made in the officers' approach to the bar'' that could ''lead to retraining and possibly a reprimand.'' Both officers kept their pistols in their holsters as they walked toward the bar, Captain Julian said. He added that he did not know whether they believed the robbers had already fled. The officers were identified as Frank Lello, 25 years old, who joined the force in July 1983, and Silvia Pacheco, 23, who joined in January 1985. They were treated at St. John's Hospital for shock and released. No injuries to patrons were reported. Captain Julian said the police could not provide statistics on the number of incidents in which officers had lost their guns to assailants. ''It's not the first time, but it is rare,'' he said. Such incidents are thoroughly reviewed, and many are used as a basis for officer training sessions on how to avoid them, he added. Transit Officer Helps The robbery occurred at 1:15 A.M. at the Greenpoint Tavern, 188 Bedford Avenue in the Greenpoint section. The two suspects were quickly arrested because an off-duty transit police officer, initially unaware of the robbery but walking nearby, wrote down the getaway car's license plate number after hearing its driver shout ''Did you get the guns?'' before speeding off. The police used the information to trace the car to the home of one of the suspects, Martin Allen, 36, of 270 Crown Street in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. The car was registered to his wife, the police said. The second suspect in custody was identified as James Radden, 33, of 829 Beverly Road in the Flatbush section,"
The New York Times," Oh, What the New Year Might Bring"," Clark Clifford has watched many a tumultuous year pass in the nation's capital, but even he describes 1986 as an unusually eventful time. ''It's a period of ferment and a period of change,'' said Mr. Clifford, an elder statesman of the Democratic Party who has been an adviser to Democratic Presidents from Harry S. Truman on. ''And I think it will stretch into 1987,'' he said. This is a city with its own rhythm, much given to the stately pause - the Congressional recess, for example, or the Presidential vacation. But in recent months, as Mr. Clifford suggests, the capital's rhythm has quickened. And as 1986 tumbled toward 1987, seasoned Washingtonians had the sense that history was moving fast. The holidays seemed truncated, perhaps because the weeks leading up to them were filled with news of Congressional hearings on the Reagan Administration's secret arms sales to Iran and the appointment of a special prosecutor. And as the capital looked ahead, the new year seemed likely, to many, to maintain the old year's dizzying pace. In the first week of 1987, President Reagan will have prostate surgery. The 100th Congress will convene, with Democrats in control of both houses and with one of the first items of business the formal start-up of two special committees named to investigate the Iran arms deal. Both national party chairmen predict that the 1988 Presidential campaign will soon begin to escalate. The Republicans will choose a convention site in January, the Democrats not long afterward. The Republican chairman, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., said it seemed he had just finished wrapping up the 1984 convention in Dallas. There is, indeed, a breathless quality to it all. But Washingtonians still found a little time on New Year's Eve to take stock, to look back and ahead, to voice a few resolutions, predictions and dreams. Mr. Fahrenkopf took heart this week when he scanned the front page of a major newspaper and discovered not a single article on Iran. He is hopeful, albeit cautiously so, that the uproar may have reached its peak. ''Unless there's something we don't know about, I don't think it will be as high a profile,'' the party chairman said as he looked ahead to 1987. The past few months have been difficult for the Republicans. First they lost control of the Senate, then they watched Mr. Reagan become mired in controversy over the Iran arms deal and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. ''We didn't even get a chance to catch our breath after the election and the Iran thing hit,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said. ''And that was like a snowball going downhill, it went so fast.'' Mr. Fahrenkopf's New Year's resolution is to pick up two more governorships in 1987, which would give the Republicans a majority of the governors' seats. He dismisses, out of hand, the notion that the ''Reagan era'' is ending, as many Democrats have euphorically declared. ''So long as he's in that White House, he will never be a lame duck, in my view,'' Mr. Fahrenkopf said. ''He'll always be a tremendous force.'' Over the holidays, the Republican chairman said he went into his office and read some of the mail from party loyalists around the country. It was mostly Christmas cards - ''give our best to the President and First Lady'' - and Mr. Fahrenkopf said it was a wonderful lift to his mood. He did, indeed, sound enthusiastic as he viewed the approaching year. On Capitol Hill, the end of the old year and the dawn of the new were being marked by that ancient ritual of legislative bodies: the shuffling of office space. Perhaps one of the most evocative signs of change on Capitol Hill occurred when the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who is retiring after three decades in Congress, moved out of his offices this month. ''He's going to be greatly missed,'' said Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A flurry of other moving has been going on, what with the retiring and the defeated, the returning and the new, and much shuffling of staff. One of the hottest jobs of the new year will be on the staff of the special committees formed to conduct the Iran-Nicaragua investigations. ''We have received lots of applications, and I mean lots,'' said a spokesman for Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who will head the Senate panel. Mr. Kirk was closing out 1986 in good spirits. He was not complacent - Democratic leaders warn constantly of the danger of complacency regarding the Republicans' troubles over the Iran affair - but he was certainly in a confident frame of mind. ''I thought it would be a year of reckoning for the Republicans,'' the Democratic chairman said as he looked back on 1986. After his party's landslide Presidential defeat in 1984, ''It was kind of fashionable to beat up on the Democrats,'' Mr. Kirk said. He believes that in 1986, the Democratic Party regained its psychological edge and shattered the thesis that the electorate was undergoing a fundamental change in party allegiance. ''I never really bought into the so-called realignment,'' the party chairman said. In 1987, Mr. Kirk argues, the Democrats will have a great opportunity: to focus on the future, while the Republicans must defend the past, including the Iran controversy. He looked toward 1987 with the buoyance common among Democrats since the returns were tallied on Nov. 4. WASHINGTON TALK"
The New York Times, Portraits From Time," The subjects are as diverse as Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Pope John XXIII and Charles Lindbergh. Today, a selection of 25 original paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures that were used for Time magazine covers of the past will go on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery. The exhibit is titled ''Man of the Year: Portraits from the Time Collection.'' According to the portrait gallery historian and curator of the exhibit, Frederick S. Voss, the collection is of consequence because the magazine covers ''evoke the major events of our past.'' Mr. Voss notes, for example, that the 1972 Man of the Year cover displayed Richard M. Nixon and that the following year it carried the likeness of a key figure in the undoing of his Presidency, Judge John J. Sirica. Pope John appeared in 1962, the first year of Vatican II, which brought sweeping change to the Roman Catholic Church. It was not until the next year, 1963, more than 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, that the first black Man of the Year, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., appeared on the cover. WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING"
The New York Times, RYAN IS NOT ALONE AMONG BATTERED," The Jets remain a battered team, a fact of football life obscured by their wild-card playoff victory over the Chiefs. Even though Pat Ryan threw yesterday in his first full-scale drill for Saturday's divisional playoff against the Browns in Cleveland, he is nursing a bruised arm. And several of his key teammates are also playing with injuries. ''My arm's always stiff,'' Ryan said stoically. ''I get used to it.'' Ryan has had a chronic arm problem since 1984, when he started the first 11 games despite the injury. He began taking a day off once a week, a practice he has continued since. ''I was in a lot worse shape in '84 than I am now,'' he said. Still, the Jets are ''not playing with a full deck,'' in the words of Coach Joe Walton. The injured regulars include Marty Lyons, the defensive lineman who was sidelined late in the season with a shoulder injury. Now, both shoulders are bothering him. ''Marty's been able to help us to a certain point in the game,'' Walton concedes. ''I try not to take anything for the pain,'' says Lyons. ''You go on emotion and adrenaline, and when it gets to the point it's unbearable, you take yourself out.'' He was forced to take himself out against the Chiefs last Sunday. Mark Gastineau has played just one game since returning from knee surgery; Ken O'Brien has a sprained right pinky that could limit him if he had to replace Ryan; the right tackle, Gordon King, and the left guard, Guy Bingham, are playing because the regulars are injured; Johnny Hector has not been on the field for three games because of a hamstring problem, leaving all the halfback duties to Freeman McNeil; Tom Baldwin is still at nose tackle for the sidelined Joe Klecko; Lance Mehl's surgery rushed Rusty Guilbeau's return to linebacker even though his knee rehabilitation wasn't complete. ''But,'' asks Lyons, ''tell me who's a healthy team now?'' Results against common opponents don't mean much because football often is a game of matchups. But, anyway, here are the Jets' and Browns' scores against common foes: Buffalo - The Jets beat the Bills twice, 28-24 and 14-13; Cleveland beat them, 21-17. Cincinnati - The Jets lost, 52-21; Cleveland split, losing, 30-13, and winning, 34-3. Pittsburgh - The Jets lost by 45-24; Cleveland swept the Steelers, 27-24 and 37-31. Kansas City - The Jets beat them in the wild-card game, 35-15; Cleveland beat them, 20-7. Indianapolis - A Jet sweep, 26-7 and 31-16; Cleveland won by 24-9. Miami - A Jet split, a 51-45 victory in overtime and a 45-3 thrashing; Cleveland beat them, 26-16. The record shows the Browns were 7-1 against these teams while the Jets had a 6-3 mark against them. The Jets have played in a Super Bowl and they have been to the American Conference championship game. But when they play the Browns they will be performing in their 18th game of the season - the most they have ever played. That A.F.C. championship season? That was 1982 - the strike season when they played only nine regular-season games. The Super Bowl season was only 14 regular-season games long. They had only one playoff game - a victory over the Raiders - before the Super Bowl. The Jets' 37-10 victory over the Browns last season broke a six-year stretch between the teams in which no game was decided by more than 4 points. Two went into overtime (won by the Browns on field goals), another two were captured in regulation time by Cleveland on field goals and the Jets took one game by a missed extra point. The kicking may be a factor Saturday. Five Cleveland Stadium games this season have been decided by field goals, with the Browns winning four. ''It's a hard stadium to kick in,'' says Pat Leahy of the Jets. ''It's open and cold, but I've had some decent games in there.'' Matt Bahr, the Browns' kicker, was injured on a tackle after a kickoff. Mark Moseley, cut by the Redskins, replaced him and has been fair, kicking 12 of 19. Leahy, though, is 16 for 19.

The New York Times, PARCELLS CREDITS HIS PLAYERS," Random thoughts from Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants: On his selection by The Associated Press today as the National Football League's coach of the year: ''I coach a lot better when I have good players.'' On why the Giants have improved this year: ''We've got a lot better players.'' On inheriting some good players when he became head coach in 1983: ''Not many of them are left.'' On inheriting some of the good ones who are still here, such as Lawrence Taylor, Harry Carson and George Martin: ''Those guys were good already.'' On Mike Ditka, the volatile coach of the Chicago Bears: ''You're darn right I like him. I judge a coach by what he gets his guys to do. He gets them to do a lot. Being a good coach doesn't have anything to do with winning or losing. Unfortunately, you're judged by winning all the time. I don't think it was like that years ago.'' On why the Giants are practicing here for Sunday's playoff game here against the San Francisco 49ers, rather than moving to a southern training base as the Bears and the Cleveland Browns did: ''If you're going to play in the Atlantic, you're going to practice in the Atlantic. If we were going to play in a warm city, we probably would have gone there.'' On his weather preference for Sunday: ''The defensive guys would like a blizzard. The offensive guys would like 45 degrees and no wind. I've got to go on both sides. I'd like it to be snowing when they've got the ball and nice when we have it.'' On his key personnel move this year: ''If there was any one, it would be Raul Allegre. Getting a kicker like that made a definite difference, especially when it's 10 seconds to go and you win the game. We had a couple of those this year. You miss those and you have the hearses out.'' On which teams made the National Conference playoffs and which did not: ''I thought Minnesota was going to make it, not that they're better than the teams in it. In preseason, I thought Dallas, based on its track record, probably would be involved. And once Atlanta was 5-1, I thought they could make it if they played .500 the rest of the way.'' On the Giants' 21-point third quarter that beat the 49ers, 21-17, four weeks ago: ''We put together some big plays. I've seen the 49ers do that, too, like the second quarter of that game. Those guys moving the chains were getting tired.'' Three 49ers are listed as questionable for Sunday's game - Michael Carter, the starting nose tackle, with an injured left ankle; John Ayers, a starting offensive guard, with an injured left knee, and Mike Durrette, a backup guard, with a lower-back problem. Jeff Stover, a starting defensive end, is listed as probable with an injured left ankle, and he and Carter will probably not play full time. Ayers is an excellent pass blocker, and in past games between the Giants and the 49ers he often neutralized Taylor's pass rush. This time, Guy McIntyre, who blocks better against the run than the pass, will start for him. Carter and Stover are having seasons that would worry Blue Cross. Carter has endured, in succession, a concussion, a sprained left ankle, a sprained right ankle, a sprained right wrist and a reinjured left ankle. Stover's ailments have traveled from right knee to left shoulder to left ankle. However, Carter and Stover have missed only one game each. N.F.L. playoff games, like the heavyweight championship fights of old, attract celebrities. Andy Rooney, Telly Savalas and Walter Cronkite will have no problem seeing the Giants-49ers game because they own season tickets. Don Ameche, Shelley Winters, Postmaster General Robert Tisch and Senator Alfonse D'Amato telephoned the Giants to buy tickets and got them. Governor Cuomo, who has said the Buffalo Bills are New York's only pro football team, asked to buy four tickets and got them. So far, the Giants have not received a call from Mayor Koch, who has said that if the Giants or the Jets win the Super Bowl they should have a parade in New Jersey, where they play, rather than up Broadway. ''I don't think we will hear from him,'' said one Giant official. GIANTS NOTEBOOK"
The New York Times, REAGAN TO PROPOSE A COMPROMISE ON SPENDING FOR WATER TREATMENT," President Reagan, in a dramatic shift aimed at compromise with a Congress already preparing to defy him on the issue, is doubling his proposal for Federal spending on water treatment facilities, Administration officials said today. The President will propose that $12 billion be spent over eight years on Federal grants and loans under the Clean Water Act to help communities build sewage treatment facilities, Lee M. Thomas, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in confirming the reports of other sources. In his previous budget the President asked for $6 billion for the clean water program. Congress unanimously voted in October for legislation to provide $18 billion for sewage treatment facilities. But after Congress adjourned and could not attempt to override a regular veto, the President said he would not sign the bill. In announcing this pocket veto, Mr. Reagan said he was committed to the clean water law but added, ''Unfortunately, this bill so far exceeds acceptable levels of intended budgetry commitments that I must withhold my approval.'' Proposal Part of Budget His new proposal will come Monday in his budget for the fiscal year 1988, which under the budget law is supposed to have a deficit of no more than $108 billion. But a factor that could make it more difficult to reach that target is new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office today that the cost of Government benefit programs was increasing much faster than had been expected.  [ Page 8. ]  The version of the water program Mr. Reagan will propose would reduce the spending level Congress approved without changing the substantive revisions in the law that were made. Because the bill had been passed unanimously and had been strongly supported by business, labor, environmental and state and local government groups, most experts said that a written veto would have been easily overridden. They also said the same legislation would pass easily again in the 100th Congress. 'Strong Alternative' Is Seen The Administration will now seek to have its own legislation introduced, providing what Mr. Thomas called a ''strong alternative'' to the bill Congress passed. ''The President was looking for a compromise, recognizing where Congress was coming from last year and where it is going this year,'' Mr. Thomas explained. Another Administration official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said that the President's proposal ''is a last-gasp effort to get some moderation in that terribly expensive water bill.'' But the new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, announced today that a clean water bill identical with the one passed last year would be the first bill introduced in the Senate as the 100th Congress begins. House to Act Quickly The House is also scheduled to take up the same legislation as its first order of business. The bill may go to the floor of both chambers as early as the first week of the new session, according to staff aides on Capitol Hill. By all accounts, the legislation continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support in both Houses; it already has 58 cosponsors in the Senate. ''We intend to push this bill through the Congress and back onto the President's desk as soon as possible,'' Senator Burdick, a Democrat, said today. ''If President Reagan chooses to veto this bill, as he did its predecessor, I will lead the effort to override the veto.'' Mr. Thomas said that the Administration's water bill would gradually eliminate the sewage treatment grants over eight years, as Congress wanted, instead of over four years as the President proposed last year. He said that the proposed bill would give states more flexibility in deciding whether they wanted to use the Federal money for outright grants to municipalities or to set up loan programs, but otherwise it left last fall's Congressional legislation unchanged. Among the new provisions added to the clean water law by Congress last October was a provision requiring controls on runoff from urban streets and farms, which are serious sources of water pollution not addressed by existing law. Another new program would have required special efforts to clean up concentrations of hazardous chemicals in bodies of water. The amendments passed by Congress would give new authority to the E.P.A. to prosecute and penalize violators of the law. Critic Says It's Too Late The Clean Water Act, originally passed in 1971, was intended to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the nation's waterways and to make its rivers, lakes and streams ''swimmable and fishable.'' Mr. Thomas said he had not talked to members of Congress about the Administration proposal and did not know how it would be received. ''But this is a strong alternative and one that will fly on its merits,'' he said. Daniel Weiss, a Washington representative for the Sierra Club, a national environmental group, said that for the Administration to propose its own water legislation now was ''trying to close the barn door after the cows have gone.'' A year ago, he said, a compromise effort might have had a chance. ''But this is too little and too late,'' he contended."
The New York Times, GORBACHEV TELLS SOVIET ON NEW YEAR A THREAT OF WAR PERSISTS," As Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered a televised New Year's address to the Soviet Union, President Reagan's radio speech could be heard over the Voice of America early today on short-wave radios in spite of some jamming. According to American diplomats who monitored Mr. Reagan's broadcast here, it was audible on most of the frequencies used by Russian-language broadcasts of the Voice of America. One diplomat said that on at least two frequencies the broadcast could be easily understood. On other frequencies, the speech was drowned by static. Listeners in Leningrad reportedly received the President's message clearly. Mr. Reagan decided to beam his message to the Soviet Union by radio over the Voice of America after the Soviet Union rejected a White House proposal for an exchange of televised New Year's messages between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev. Soviet spokesmen said such an exchange would be inappropriate in light of what they described as a poor state of relations between the two countries, notably over the issue of arms control. Last year Mr. Reagan appeared on Soviet television, and Mr. Gorbachev spoke on television in the United States. In his speech today, Mr. Reagan painted an optimistic picture of progress on arms control and other aspects of Soviet-American relations. In contrast, Mr. Gorbachev, in a message to the American people handed to Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, national editor of the Hearst Newspapers, expressed disappointment over the arms control negotiations. Mr. Gorbachev said: ''People in Washington should finally decide in utter clarity what they want: a runaway arms race or a reduction and elimination of weapons.'' In his New Year's speech to the Soviet people, Mr. Gorbachev said: ''Good wishes alone are now not enough. Good deeds are also needed. Never before has the earth, our home, been subjected to such a danger. There are too many stockpiled weapons in it. These stockpiles should not be allowed to grow further, a catastrophe should not be allowed to happen.'' Deadlock on Arms Control Arms control talks in Geneva have been deadlocked since Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev agreed informally in Iceland in October on a 50 percent cut in all strategic nuclear forces over the next five years and on drastic reductions of Soviet and American medium-range missiles in Europe. A formal agreement in Iceland collapsed because the two men could not agree on a formula for limiting the development of space-based missile defenses. In the New Year's speech to the Soviet people today, Mr. Gorbachev also criticized the American refusal to join the Soviet Union in a halt of nuclear testing and the American decision to stop adhering informally to the strategic arms limitation treaty of 1979. ''Deliberately and pointedly wrecking old treaties does not help the conduct of successful talks on new agreements,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. Most of his speech was devoted to what he called an encouraging start on efforts to revitalize the economy. He said the prospects engendered by the Iceland summit meeting had been set back by ''old conservative thinking'' by Western politicians. On domestic matters, he said the Soviet Union had ''laid the beginning for a comprehensive renewal of our society'' through greater openness in the press and in the arts as well as through economic change. But he warned that ''the forces of stagnation and complacency are still making themselves felt, some people still hope that everything will return to the old beaten track.'' ----Citizens Have Exchange In a live, four-hour radio program broadcast yesterday by radio stations in the United States and the Soviet Union, citizens of the two nations wished one another ''Happy New Year'' and the Russian equivalent, ''S novym godom.'' The program made no mention of the Soviet Union's rejection of an exchange of televised New Year's greetings between President Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Poets, children, singers, and classical, jazz and rock musicians from both countries performed and chatted. At one point, two cooks in New York and Moscow swapped recipes for New Year's specialties. The program was broadcast in New York over WBAI radio starting at 7 A.M. and over the Soviet radio network at 3 P.M. Moscow time. It included live broadcasts from other cities in both countries. The program, a joint production of the two radio stations, was part of a peace vigil that began worldwide at noon Greenwich time in London (7 A.M. Eastern Standard time)."

The New York Times," U.S. TRADE DEFICIT HITS $19.2 BILLION, A MONTHLY RECORD"," The nation's trade deficit soared to a record $19.2 billion in November, a startling setback following three months of improvement, the Commerce Department reported today. The gloomy figures put the United States on track for an estimated 1986 trade deficit of $173.6 billion, which would be $25 billion more than 1985's record shortfall. Special factors, including a small fee imposed Dec. 1 on most imported goods and rising calls for protectionist legislation, were responsible for a significant portion of the deterioration, as exporting countries and American importers accelerated the shipment of goods to this country. Private analysts expressed keen disappointment with the November figures, which Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's top economist, termed ''horrendous.'' Data 'Raise Questions' The latest data ''raise questions about whether the trade accounts have turned around, as seemed to be the case by earlier figures,'' Stuart A. Schweitzer, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said. The figures also prompted predictions that Congress, with both chambers about to be controlled by the Democrats, would intensify its efforts to restrict imports. In the currency markets, the Commerce Department report caused a selloff of the dollar, sending it to new six-year lows against the West Germany mark and other European currencies. As the dollar became less attractive, gold lured many buyers in holiday-shortened trading, surging above $400 an ounce.  [ Page 51. ]  Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the new majority leader, seized the occasion to declare: ''The Administration has pretended that we have no trade crisis and that our trade problems will take care of themselves. With today's news, the Administration should make a New Year's resolution to work with Congress to enact comprehensive trade and competitiveness legislation that will restore jobs and halt the erosion of our industrial base.'' Deficit With Japan Surges Among the dispiriting figures in today's report was a 35 percent jump, to $6.74 billion, in the trade deficit with Japan, the biggest one-month excess of imports over exports ever recorded with any country. Meanwhile, the deficit with Western Europe nearly tripled, and that with the developing world jumped nearly 40 percent. The bulk of the new deterioration in the American trade position last month was accounted for by a 20.5 percent jump in imports, to a record $37.8 billion. ''It continues to be more attractive to import than to use U.S. goods and services,'' Steve H. Hanke, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, said. ''We haven't yet turned the corner.'' Largely because of the dollar's decline against the Japanese yen, West German mark and other major currencies over the last two years, economists have predicted that the trade deficit was bound to improve, as imported goods became more costly to Americans and American goods became more attractively priced abroad. In October, when exports posted a hefty increase and growth of imports appeared to have subsided, many suggested that the long-awaited narrowing of the trade gap had finally begun. New Doubt But today's report cast doubt on this. It also gave fresh ammunition to the argument that too little attention had been paid to the fact that the dollar has not fallen much, if at all, against the currencies of such major trading partners as Canada and Mexico, and such increasingly important Far East exporters as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. American exports, meanwhile, fell 3.8 percent, to a total of $18.6 billion. November thus was only the second month - the first was July - in which imports outpaced exports by a 2-to-1 ratio. The November report also pushed the deficit for the first 11 months of the year to $159.1 billion, eclipsing 1985's record $148.5 billion. The existence of several special factors in the November report, however, served to dispel at least some of the general gloom. An important factor in spurring imports, it was widely agreed, was the imposition on Dec. 1 of a 22-cent-per-$100 levy on all imported goods, except those from the Caribbean. Analysts also speculated that the increasing talk of protectionist legislation - fanned by the takeover of the Senate by the Democrats in the Nov. 4 elections - may have inspired efforts to import as much as possible before further possible restrictions. It also seemed likely, analysts said, that the new 1986 tax law acted to raise imports in November. Imports of foreign automobiles, for example, climbed about $1 billion, as dealers apparently rebuilt inventories depleted when consumers rushed to buy new cars while they could still deduct sales taxes. Depreciation Schedules Deliveries of some business equipment were also thought to have been stepped up to take advantage of favorable depreciation schedules. Imports of steel were also higher, according to Commerce Under Secretary Bruce Smart, because of a strike at the USX Corporation and because this was a final opportunity for foreigners to get in under 1986 quotas. Mr. Smart said, moreover, that nearly 40 percent of the $7.2 billion increase in the November deficit reflected an exceptionally big ''catch-up'' in the processing of shipments actually made in preceding months. The American bill for imported oil rose to $3 billion last month, from $2.7 billion in October, reflecting a 9.3 percent rise in volume and a per-barrel price increase of 19 cents. Agricultural commodities posted their fourth consecutive trade surplus, $484 million, after slipping into deficit earlier this year for the first time since the early 1970's. The record deficit with Japan reflected a sharp increase in imports -to $8.7 billion, from $7.3 billion - and a decline in exports, to $1.99 billion, from $2.28 billion. $1.76 Billion With Taiwan The deficit with Taiwan, $1.76 billion, was larger than that with any European country, and the deficits with South Korea and Hong Kong, both just under $825 million, were bigger than any European country except West Germany. The deficit with Canada soared to $2.8 billion last month, from $1.6 billion, the department reported."
The New York Times, U.S. AIDE DEFENDS DELAY ON IRAN-CONTRA FINDING," A senior Justice Department official said today that a document that is believed to have disclosed the first link between Iranian arms shipments and support for Nicaraguan rebels contained no obvious indication that a crime had been committed. The official, Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, said the document revealed nothing that ''jumped off the page that suggested a criminal violation.'' He said he discovered the document in late November, in a preliminary investigation of the Iran arms sale. Although declining to discuss its contents, Mr. Reynolds said in an interview that he and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d were ''surprised'' when they found the document and learned of a link between arms sales to Iran and support for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. 'A Leap of Faith' But he said it was unfair ''to assume that because money went to the contras that there was a criminal violation - that would be a leap of faith.'' Mr. Reynolds's comments were significant because they appeared to explain why the Justice Department did not move more quickly to call the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the case. According to his account, there was no immediate need for the F.B.I. or criminal prosecutors because there was no clear sign of criminality. Mr. Reynolds also offered an extended defense of the department's handling of the Iran inquiry. ''I keep asking myself what it is we could have done differently,'' he said. ''I have yet to see where we misstepped.'' According to the department, the F.B.I. was called into the case three days after Mr. Reynolds discovered the document in White House files. Legislators have criticized the department for the delay, saying it might have allowed White House aides time to destroy documents sensitive to the case. A Draft Directive According to Government officials, the document was a draft national security directive suggesting the need to raise $12 million for the contras from the Iran arms sale. The author, the officials said, is believed to have been Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, a former National Security Council aide. The Justice Department has said that it took three days to gather sufficient evidence, through interviews and a review of documents, to show that a criminal investigation was needed. Mr. Reynolds, who oversees the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and is one of Mr. Meese's closest advisers, was part of a small team of lawyers who uncovered the diversion of the Iran payments during a fact-finding inquiry into the arms sale. Asked about reports that documents had been destroyed by Colonel North and other White House officials in late November, Mr. Reynolds said he had no knowledge that any material had been destroyed. In the November investigation, the Justice Department team interviewed Colonel North and the former White House national security adviser, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter. The Justice Department has said that Mr. Reynolds found the critical document on Nov. 22, a Saturday. On the following Tuesday, the department's criminal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents were brought into the case. Mr. Reynolds said it was appropriate not to involve the criminal prosecutors in the initial stages of the inquiry. 'Host of Investigatory Problems' ''It was felt, and I think quite properly, that it would have been a mistake to have brought in criminal investigators at a time well before anybody had any inkling of any kind of criminal culpability,'' he said. ''You've got a whole host of investigatory problems that attach once you launch a criminal investigation,'' he said. ''Certain things have to be done in particular ways. Certain people have to be approached in particlar ways.'' ''I would venture to guess that if we had undertaken to launch a criminal investigation then, which I think would have been very premature, we would never have collected the kind of information we were able to gather by an informal fact-gathering activity,'' Mr. Reynolds said. He said the Chief of the Criminal Division, William Weld, and Mr. Weld's supervisor, Associate Attorney General Stephen S. Trott, had agreed with the handling of the case. INQUIRY ON CONTRAS IS BEGUN WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (AP) -House investigators have begun another inquiry into allegations that Nicaraguan rebels and their United States supporters were involved in drug trafficking and gun-running, the head of a Congressional crime panel said today. Mr. Hughes said his investigators, who have already done field work in Miami, were looking at ''allegations that have surfaced relative to narcotics trafficking and gun-running'' in Central America."
The New York Times, TASTY MENU FOR FOOTBALL FANS," New Year's Day is one of the days that make college football fans feel like mosquitos in a nudist camp -they don't know where to begin. The majority will begin with the Florida Citrus and end with the Orange. In between, the Cotton, the Sugar and the Rose Bowls will fill television screens across the nation. So, pull up a chair: FLORIDA CITRUS Auburn (9-2) vs. Southern Cal (7-4). Noon E.S.T., Orlando, Fla., ABC-TV.  Southern California is the only one of the bowl teams that is not ranked among the Top 20. As a result, the Trojans are the underdogs against the nation's fourth-best scoring team. The Trojans will also be facing the second stingiest team in the country as Auburn gave up only 10.5 points a game, topped only by Oklahoma's 6.6 points per game. Southern California has been noted for its distinguished running backs in the past, names like O. J. Simpson, Charles White and Marcus Allen. But this season's leading rusher for the Trojans is Ryan Knight with 550 yards. As a result, this game will most likely be a match of a running Auburn team, led by Brent Fullwood, the nation's fourth-leading rusher, against the passing Trojans. Fullwood averaged 126 yards a game, while Rodney Peete, the quarterback for the Trojans, threw for 2,025 yards and 10 touchdowns. COTTON BOWL Texas A & M (9-2) vs. Ohio St. (9-3). 1:30 P.M. E.S.T., Dallas, CBS-TV. Ohio State makes the Big Ten Conference's debut in the Cotton Bowl, while Texas A & M seeks to become only the second school in the bowl's history to win it in consecutive years. The eighth-ranked Aggies, who defeated Auburn, 36-16, last New Year's Day, want to match Texas's back-to-back Cotton Bowl championships in 1969-1970. This may be a better Texas A & M team than the one that defeated Auburn last year. Coach Jackie Sherrill, who turned things around for the Aggies in five seasons, has the third-best offensive and the fourth-best defensive team in the nation. Only Oklahoma, first in total defense and second in total offense, has a better combination. Coach Earle Bruce of the Buckeyes is the subject of speculation each year that he is in his last season with the team, but Bruce has led the Buckeyes to a bowl game in each of his eight seasons as coach. They have gone to nine different Bowl games in the last 11 years. They lost to Alabama and Washington to start the season and fell to Michigan in the last game. SUGAR BOWL L.S.U. (9-2) vs. Nebraska (9-2). 3:30 P.M. E.S.T., New Orleans, ABC-TV. The two teams will meet for the second time in three years in the Sugar Bowl, with Nebraska winning in 1985. This will mark the end of Bill Arnsparger's short coaching career at L.S.U. as he leavs to become athletic director at Florida. Louisiana State has a fair running attack, but the Tigers will be going against the second-best defensive team in the nation. Danny Noonan, the all-America middle guard from Nebraska, is the player L.S.U. must prevent from causing havoc in its backfield. With Tom Hogson, a red-shirted freshman, throwing, Wendell Davis, a junior split end, is the primary offensive threat for the Tigers. Hogson threw for 2,261 yards and 19 touchdowns, with Davis catching 80 passes for 1,244 yards and 11 touchdowns. Coach Tom Osborne of Nebraska has, as always, a fine I-back, or tailback, in Keith Jones, who gained 830 yards during the season. Steve Taylor has also become a solid quarterback for the Cornhuskers. He passed for 808 yards and ran for another 537, accounting for 15 touchdowns. ORANGE BOWL Oklahoma (10-1) vs. Arkansas (9-2). 8:30 P.M. E.S.T., Miami, NBC-TV. The declaration that Brian Bosworth, the all-America linebacker from Oklahoma, could not play because he tested positive for steroid use created the most publicity and also diminished Oklahoma's position as the heavy favorite. Bosworth's loss has put a lot of pressure on his replacement, Dante Jones. ''If I miss a tackle or something, I know some people will be saying Brian would have made that one, '' Jones said. ''I guess it's good in a way, though. It'll make me play harder.'' Arkansas also lost a starting linebacker, David Dudley, because of steroids, thus putting each team minus a key player in their most important game of the season. Since both teams employ the wishbone, the linebackers are particularly important in this game for stopping any ground attack and the options from the wishbone."
The New York Times," MERRILL, I.B.M. END VENTURE"," The International Business Machines Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that they would end their once-promising venture in computerizing the financial services industry. They said the action followed a ''reassessment'' of the financial feasibility of the venture, called International Marketnet. The failure appeared to be a setback for both companies, which had staked millions of dollars on the highly publicized project. Over the last two and a half years, executives of the venture - commonly known as Imnet - had predicted that the combination of I.B.M., with its technical prowess, and Merrill Lynch, with its understanding of the needs of brokers and investors, could leap ahead of competitors like Quotron Systems Inc., now a subsidiary of Citicorp. Termination Is Sudden Two years ago, Joseph P. Castellano, the head of the Imnet venture, said, ''In five or six years we think the market for Marketnet could be as big as $1 billion.'' But yesterday Imnet's 267 staff members were called to a meeting to learn of the sudden termination. Top executives of the venture left its financial district headquarters, and company spokesmen said they would be unavailable. Nor would executives of Merrill Lynch and I.B.M. comment, and efforts to reach Mr. Castellano at home were unsuccessful. In the last 24 months, Imnet discovered that few brokerages other than Merrill Lynch were willing to pay the steep price for the company's services, which combine analytical software and data bases accessible by satellite from central computers. ''It cost too much, and the market just evaporated,'' one midlevel official of the venture said yesterday. ''Starting about the middle of this year, it became clear the whole idea was a disaster.'' I.B.M. and Merrill Lynch announced the end of the project in a four-sentence release. Both companies said the decision had been made ''at the highest levels'' of both companies - presumably meaning it was approved by John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, and William Schreyer, who holds the same title at Merrill Lynch. The companies said the decision to close Imnet would have no significant effect on earnings for 1986 or 1987. Many Others Have Failed With yesterday's announcement, Imnet joins a long list of home and office information services that have failed in recent years. Last month, CBS Inc. pulled out of Trintex, a failing videotex venture with I.B.M. and Sears that was established at about the same time as Imnet. In March, Knight-Ridder Inc., the newspaper publisher, abandoned its $50 million videotex effort, intended to bring news, stock prices and shopping information to home computers. The Times Mirror Company and the Centel Corporation also abandoned their offerings in southern California and Chicago. But Imnet was developed for a sophisticated audience - financial professionals - and was intended to do much more than provide information. With Merrill's own 500 branch offices as the first customers, the system was considered a serious competitor of Quotron - whose stock value plunged nearly 30 percent when I.B.M. and Merrill first announced their plans. A Promising Start The venture seemed extremely promising at first. I.B.M. was contributing its computer technology, using a variant of its personal computer as the vehicle for both distributing information to brokers and allowing them to analyze portfolios and assess the future of equities. At the same time, Merrill was focusing on the software and marketing, providing brokers in remote offices with instant access to its research reports and up-to-date recommendations for purchases and sales. The plan was that brokers could eventually trade over the system, which would be connected by satellite to Merrill's central computers. But the only product that Imnet installed in volume was System 100, a program for analysis of equities that was never hooked to the Imnet network. A sophisticated portfolio-management system - intended for Merrill's offices and marketing to other brokerages - was being tested at the time the project was abandoned. Market Misjudged But if the Imnet system was far more sophisticated than home offerings, it appeared to fail for the same reason they did: A misjudgment about how many customers would be willing to pay the price for the added information. ''The marketplace had not developed as we anticipated,'' said Traug Keller, Imnet's director of communications. ''As we began to install the system, we thought we would find a much more sympathetic marketplace. But to get wide acceptance, the pricing structure had to change dramatically - and that shrinks the margin.'' Another Imnet official said a recent review of a study, started at I.B.M.'s instigation, had concluded that ''the project would not be profitable for a long, long time, and might never be profitable at all.'' The cancellation also appears to end a joint effort of Imnet and the Public Broadcasting System, which announced two years ago that it would send stock quotations and financial news to home subscribers over an unused portion of its television signal. PBS officials, who had hoped the system would bring millions of dollars to the nonprofit broadcaster, were unavailable for comment.

The New York Times, MUSEUM OFFICIAL AND AUTHOR," Richard Dougherty, a former vice president of the Metropolitan Museum who was also a novelist, died of lung cancer Tuesday in Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. He was 65 years old. Mr. Dougherty lived in Quogue, L.I., and also had an apartment in Manhattan. He served as press secretary for George McGovern's Presidential campaign in 1972 and as Deputy Police Commissioner of New York City for community relations in the 1950's. He had earlier been a newspaperman. He joined the museum in 1974 with the title of vice director for public affairs, which was later changed to vice president for public affairs. He retired in 1984. At the museum, he was in charge of fund raising, membership and public relations. Fund raising flourished in his era and the membership of the museum more than doubled, Emily Rafferty, the vice president for development, said yesterday; it is now 110,000, which is the largest membership of any museum in the United States. Philippe de Montebello, the director of the museum, said Mr. Dougherty was ''outrageously charming, funny, outspoken and so often right.'' He added, ''I'll deeply miss his counsel and good cheer.'' Thomas Hoving, the director of the museum from 1967 to 1977, said Mr. Dougherty was ''one of the brightest sparklers at the museum in his day; he brought that professionalism and experience that you get as a journalist, with a lot of political smarts.'' Mr. Hoving, now editor in chief of Connoisseur magazine, said Mr. Dougherty played important roles ''in puncturing every hot-air balloon in sight'' at the museum and in bringing it ''into the real world of the late 20th century.'' Consultant to Museum After retiring, Mr. Dougherty was a consultant to the museum, advising executives and coordinating the search committee that chose the new president, William H. Luers - a former United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Venezuela - to succeed William B. Macomber, who retired in June. Fund-raising innovations at the museum while Mr. Dougherty was vice president included the creation of the business committee, an advisory group that helps raise money from the business community, and other, similar panels. Earlier in his career, Mr. Dougherty was the New York bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times. He was with The New York Herald Tribune as a reporter, from 1948 to 1951, and as a national political writer in its Washington bureau, from 1964 to 1966. He wrote five novels, ''A Summer World'' (1960); ''Duggan'' (1962); ''The Commissioner'' (1962), which was the basis for the movie and television series ''Madigan''; ''We Dance and Sing'' (1971), and ''Botch/Up,'' which he finished shortly before his death, as well as a nonfiction book, ''Goodbye, Mr. Christian: A Personal Account of McGovern's Rise and Fall'' (1973). During his varied career he was also a playwright and a television news executive and held other posts in journalism and public affairs. A native of Bolivar, N.Y., Mr. Dougherty was a sergeant in the Army Air Force during World War II and earned an A.B. degree from Columbia University in 1948. He is survived by his wife, the former Cynthia Abbott; two sisters, Maureen Nagle of Bolivar and Elizabeth Kornreich of Manhattan, and a daughter, Elizabeth Dougherty. A memorial service is scheduled on Jan. 9 at 4:30 P.M. in St. Bartholomew's Church, 109 East 50th Street. RICHARD DOUGHERTY, 65, DIES"
The New York Times, 25% OF KEY LEGISLATORS MISS MASS-TRANSIT VOTE," Roughly one-quarter of the legislators from New York City and other areas served by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were absent Tuesday when the State Legislature voted to approve a financing package to rebuild the mass-transit system. No one has suggested that the outcome would have been different if the missing legislators had been present. The plan passed by a large margin in both houses. But citizen groups and others were critical. ''They figured the votes were there to pass what needed to be passed,'' said Paul H. Elisha, executive director of the New York State branch of Common Cause, a citizen advocacy group. ''But at a time when there's a great deal of discussion about raises for legislators, a full-time Legislature, the whole manner in which this special session was handled shows a very cavalier attitude on the part of legislators to the needs of the constituents. One would hope that that's not a bellwether for the year to come.'' #30 Absentees Recorded Of the 40 state senators who represent the 12-county area served by the M.T.A., 11 were officially listed as absent or ''excused.'' And in the Assembly, which has 94 members whose districts fall within the M.T.A. service area, 19 members were similarly listed. The counties served by the M.T.A. include the five of New York City, as well as Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam. Spokesmen for the absent legislators ascribed the poor turnout Tuesday to the timing of the special session, together with the certainty of the vote's outcome. The bill's fate, they said, was decided in negotiations last week. Timothy J. Taylor, a spokesman for Senator Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, the Senate minority leader, said that Mr. Ohrenstein had longstanding arrangements for a family trip to Austria and that he had been assured by Governor Cuomo there was no reason to cancel those plans. He said Mr. Ohrenstein, a Democrat, would have returned to Albany if there had been any indication of a crisis. 'No One Anticipated It' ''For the session to go over the holidays was an extraordinary thing, and no one anticipated it,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''People were coming out of a grueling election year and legitimately made holiday plans.'' In addition, he said, ''the difficulties over the course of the session involved political issues, not the issue of attendance. Once the negotiations were completed, the obligation was to produce the votes to pass the bill, and that was done.'' A spokesman for Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican who also missed the vote, would not say where he was but added that he, too, had made arrangements to return to Albany if his vote was needed. Some legislators - despite previous plans - felt they had an obligation to be here. Senator Donald M. Halperin, a Brooklyn Democrat, interrupted a family vacation in Florida to be present for the vote, saying he felt the terms of the final compromise remained uncertain until late in the negotiations. 'It Was Still Unclear' ''I don't think anybody really knew what the exact vote or exact tally would be,'' he said. ''It was still unclear as to whether or not there would be an an agreement. Monday night is when they came up with the last part of the deal.'' Reached by telephone in Florida, where he returned late Tuesday, Mr. Halperin said he felt that his decision to return was correct but that he did not feel any ill will toward other legislators who did not attend. ''We talk about the family of New York, but legislators have families and children and wives who can be very upset by things like this,'' he said. These are the members of the Legislature from the M.T.A. service area who were officially listed as absent or excused from Tuesday's vote:  State Senate  Howard Babbush (D-Brooklyn)  Abraham Bernstein (D-Bronx)  John E.

The New York Times, COST OF U.S. BENEFIT PROGRAMS RISING," New estimates by the Congressional Budget Office show that the cost of Government benefit programs is increasing much faster than had been expected. The increase appears to result in part from decisions by state officials to expand social welfare programs such as Medicaid, which provides health care to the poor and is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states. In the Medicaid program, states set eligibility criteria and define the scope of benefits within guidelines set by Federal law. In the last year many states have expanded Medicaid eligibility or increased benefits to provide more assistance to pregnant women and children from low-income families. In each state, the Federal Government pays at least half the costs of Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal-state welfare program. Giant Share of U.S. Spending Benefit programs account for nearly half of all Federal spending. In August the budget office estimated that the cost of these programs would rise from $467 billion in the current fiscal year, 1987, to $499 billion in 1988 and eventually to $593 billion in 1991. Aides to Rudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said today that the new estimates were $10 billion to $15 billion higher for 1987 and for 1988, and more than $20 billion higher for 1991. These figures suggest that it will be difficult for Congress to meet the deficit targets set in the budget-balancing law signed by President Reagan in December 1985. The targets are $144 billion for 1987 and $108 billion for 1988. Under the law, the budget is supposed to be balanced by 1991. Mr. Reagan plans to submit his 1988 budget to Congress on Monday. His budget director, James C. Miller 3d, has said that the President's budget would show a deficit of no more than $108 billion in 1988. Estimates of the cost of benefit programs have not yet been made public, and the budget does not contain a figure combining all the benefit programs. The latest estimates by the Congressional Budget Office mean that Democrats will be under new pressure to restrain the growth of domestic programs that they might otherwise want to expand. Democrats in the Senate and the House have begun drafting legislation to expand welfare, Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid. Under the major benefit programs, such as Social Security, student loans and unemployment compensation, people are entitled to benefits if they meet certain eligibility requirements set by law. In some of the programs, there is a test of financial need. But in others, people can obtain benefits regardless of their income or asssets. Several of the programs provide assistance to farmers to support the prices of agricultural commodities such as corn, wheat, rice and cotton. Aides to Mr. Penner said the projected costs of these programs had risen substantially above the levels estimated in August: $19.7 billion for 1987 and $21.6 billion for 1988. But they said the new figures would not be disclosed for at least a week. Change in Revenue Estimates Administration officials said President Reagan's budget would show revenue dramatically different from that estimated by Congress when it approved a major tax bill in September. At that time, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation compared the new measure with prior law and concluded that it would generate $11 billion more in 1987, but $17 billion less in 1988. But Mr. Reagan's budget, using estimates developed by the Treasury Department, says the new law will produce a bigger gain in 1987, $18 billion, and no loss at all in 1988. David H. Brockway, chief of staff for the joint committee, said the panel had not changed its estimates. The Treasury's figures have political implications because they would make it easier for the President and Congress to reduce the deficit in 1987 and 1988. But in later years the Treasury's estimates would have a different effect, because they show smaller gains in revenue, or more of a loss, than the joint committee's estimates. Most state income-tax laws are linked to Federal tax law in some way. Thirty-five states are expected to gain revenue if they make no change in their own laws. Some of the states plan to use part of that money to expand social welfare benefits. Such changes could require a further increase in Federal spending because the Federal Government shares the cost of several major social welfare programs. The Federal contribution ranges from 50 percent to 78 percent of the cost of benefits under Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Increase for Science Foundation While proposing cuts in many domestic programs, Administration officials said Mr. Reagan would seek an increase of more than 15 percent in the budget of the National Science Foundation, which supports research in science and engineering. The agency has a budget of $1.6 billion this year. The proposed increase is part of Mr. Reagan's overall effort to ''keep America competitive'' by maintaining its technological edge over other countries. But budget officials said Mr. Reagan would ask Congress to slash the budget of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations around the country. Congress has already voted to give the corporation $214 million in 1988, $228 million in 1989 and $254 million 1990. Mr. Reagan wants to cut the corporation's budget to $170 million in 1988, $140 million in 1989 and $132 million in 1990, according to confidential budget documents."
The New York Times, POPULATION IN U.S. JUMPS," The United States will begin the new year with an estimated population of 242.1 million, 15.5 million more people than were counted in the 1980 census. The Census Bureau said the new population estimate of 242,085,811 was almost 2.2 million higher than recorded on New Year's Day 1986. Government officials said the country would probably grow by another 2.2 million in 1987. While the new figure represents a sizable increase, it is well below the record for net population growth in a single year. In 1956 the population in the United States jumped 3.1 million, to 168 million. The current population figure is based on an estimated 3.7 million births, 2.1 million deaths and a net migration of 554,000 in 1986. Birth and death levels are expected to be slightly higher in 1987, with the birth figure projected to be at its highest level since the 1960's, the bureau said. The population increased nine-tenths of one percent in 1985 and 1986 and 1 percent in each year from 1981 to 1984. In contrast, the annual rate of increase in the peak years of the Baby Boom, from 1947 to 1961, ranged from 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent."
The New York Times, Secretary Baldrige Remains On Hospital Satisfactory List," Malcolm Baldrige, the Secretary of Commerce, remained in satisfactory condition today while doctors tried to determine the cause of a lung ailment that has kept him hospitalized since Saturday. ''He's still making progress, but there is no prognosis,'' said Bob Hlady, a spokesman for the University of New Mexico Hospital. ''There have been no significant developments.''"
The New York Times, CUOMO PLANS TRIPS TO FIVE STATES EARLY IN '87 AND MORE LATER," Governor Cuomo, widely regarded as a possible Presidential candidate in 1988, said today that within the next few months he would travel to Iowa, Florida, Louisiana, California and North Carolina and that ''there will be more'' national trips by mid-1987. The Governor, who has repeatedly said he is not running for President, denied that the trips were linked to a race for the White House. But many national Democratic figures, who have told Mr. Cuomo he must send a signal of his intentions by early 1987 if he is to have any chance of winning the Presidential nomination, said they viewed his travel plans as the early stage of a White House campaign. ''There is no basis to say I'm being coy about running for President,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. ''If I chose to explore the Presidency, I wouldn't do it in a backward way. I'll say I'm exploring the Presidency.'' But when asked outright if he was running, he did not completely rule out the possibility of a race. ''It's what I've always said: 'I have no plans,' '' he said. The Governor, whose first-term lieutenant governor resigned two years ago, said that with the beginning of a second term on Thursday, with a new lieutenant governor, he now felt he could spend more time traveling. He acknowledged that the trips would stir talk of a Presidential race, but said he had found that speculation existed no matter what actions he took. Mr. Cuomo, who was to be sworn in tonight in a private ceremony at the Governor's mansion, added that in the past he had frequently turned down speaking engagements elsewhere in the country for fear of generating speculation about the Presidency and that, as a result, ''I have forfeited the opportunity to say good things.'' Trips to Crucial States The five states he mentioned for visits early in 1987 include ones considered crucial to any Presidential race. Three of the states - Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana -are in the South, an area where many strategists have said Mr. Cuomo needs to spend time to soften an image as ''a Northeastern liberal.'' Many national strategists say the South could be the key in the 1988 race for the Presidency. A fourth state, Iowa, holds the earliest official Presidential test, the Iowa caucuses, in early 1988. And the other state, California, is home to many large campaign contributors and has the most electoral votes. ''I would suspect that for Mario Cuomo, this is the first stage of something,'' said Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina. ''This is the first I have known of any concrete evidence that he might really be an interested candidate.'' ''This is a right interesting occurrence,'' said Mr. Riley, who is a former chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. ''This look-see is good for him and the Democratic Party, and I would like to see more of it.'' Mr. Cuomo's travel plans include the following: * Feb. 11, in Los Angeles for the 15th anniversary dinner of the Center for Law and the Public Interest. * Feb. 16, at Tulane University in New Orleans for a symposium entitled ''Directions 1987.'' * Feb. 27, at a forum sponsored in Boca Raton, Fla., by the political columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. The Gover-nor may also stop at the spring-training camps of the Mets and the Yankees. * In March, on a date yet to be set, for a forum at Duke University in Chapel Hill, N.C. * In May, on a date not released, in Grinnell, Iowa, for the commencement speech at Grinnell College. Mr. Cuomo has traveled extensively nationally before - in 1986, he made six trips outside New York State, not including occasional official visits to Washington. But previously, he has always announced trips individually. The fact that he disclosed five trips at one time was viewed by national strategists as an intention to send a signal. 'Nothing Spectacular' Mr. Cuomo responded that ''these aren't political trips.'' ''This is nothing spectacular,'' he continued. ''These are all invitations that have been lingering for a long time and I told them decisions would not be made until the end of the legislative session.'' Democratic officials in several of the states said that while Mr. Cuomo was visiting they wanted him to attend political functions as well, such as fund-raising events. Asked about that, Mr. Cuomo said those requests had not yet reached him. ''Nobody's asked me,'' he said. When asked if there was a theme that he would stress throughout his trips, the Governor said he doubted so because the forums were so varied and because some of them would be mostly question-and-answer sessions. 'Like Going to a Carnival' ''Evans and Novak - that's pure fun,'' he said jokingly of the Florida visit. ''They're all conservatives and you stand up there and they all beat you up. It's like going to a carnival where they tie your hands behind your back and they throw baseballs at your head.'' Later in the interview, however, the Governor sounded a theme that he has been talking about more and more and that many expect would be the thrust of a Presidential campaign. He talked about a failure by the Reagan Administration and by Washington generally to recognize that economic problems -unemployment, the Federal deficit, the imbalance in trade, third-world debt -are interconnected and require a broad, unified solution. Referring to the economic problems, he pointed out that both houses of Congress would be Democratic beginning in 1987 and added, ''With this wonderful opportunity the Democrats fought to win, comes a very heavy burden of responsibility because now you have to produce.''"
The New York Times, REAGAN SENDS UPBEAT SPEECH TO SOVIET PEOPLE OVER 'VOICE'," President Reagan, in a New Year's message to the Soviet Union, said today that the two countries were ''closer now than ever before'' to an agreement to reduce nuclear arsenals. In a 10-minute radio broadcast, which the Voice of America also transmitted to Eastern Europe, Mr. Reagan said that the United States and the Soviet Union had taken major steps toward permanent peace in 1986. The upbeat comment offered a different assessment of Soviet-American relations than the one given in Moscow. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry rejected a proposal that Mr. Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev exchange New Year's greetings over television, as they did last New Year's Day. The Soviet spokesman said such an exchange at this time would be inappropriate in view of what he described as the low state of relations and a deadlock in arms control talks. After the Soviet rejection, the White House decided to transmit Mr. Reagan's message by radio. In the speech, Mr. Reagan said that the Iceland summit meeting on Oct. 25-26 had yielded positive results despite its collapse over limitation of space-based missile defenses. Although the aftermath has left a new arms control accord in doubt, according to American officials, Mr. Reagan said: ''We did move things a good distance forward. On many issues, we made more progress in those two days than our diplomats made in the last two years. Yes, a great deal of work remains, but both sides are closer now than ever before.'' Mr. Reagan did not mention two of the issues that, according to Soviet spokesmen, have chilled relations. One is Mr. Reagan's decision to stop adhering informally to the provisions of the unratified strategic arms limitation treaty of 1979. The other is his refusal to join Mr. Gorbachev in a halt of nuclear weapon testing. In his message, Mr. Reagan seemed to praise the Soviet Union for its decision to end the exile of Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist and rights advocate. ''Whenever there is a restoration of those rights to a man or a woman, as has happened recently,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''it helps strengthen the foundations for trust and cooperation between our two countries. And by the same token, whenever those rights are denied, the foundation is seriously weakened. We welcome progress in this area, as much as we welcome it in the effort to secure nuclear arms reduction.'' Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived here Monday from Los Angeles to spend the New Year at the 220-acre estate of Walter Annenberg, the publisher. The Reagans have welcomed the New Year at the Annenberg estate for nearly two decades."

The New York Times, HILL IS ACHIEVING GOALS FOR KNICKS," During his first month as head coach of the Knicks, Bob Hill spoke often about how the team, after more than two horrendous seasons, must ''learn how to win'' again. He repeated the phrase so often, in fact, that it began to sound like the rantings of an eternal optimist - the kind who insists the glass is still half-full even when the bottom is bone dry. Hill even tried some not-so-subtle tactics, such as placing signs that read ''Unselfishness is contagious'' in the locker room, and putting on display three trophies representing the Knicks' three Eastern Conference championships. And he sometimes placed inspirational messages in players' lockers, one of which read: ''You play this game with your hands and feet, but you win it with your head.'' The players now admit it. They snickered. Hill, however, appears to have gotten through. On Tuesday, the Knicks gained the kind of victory that some of the players say they would not have achieved under Hill's predecessor, Hubie Brown. Down by 10 points to the Washington Bullets with less than 7 minutes to play, they combined defensive intensity, offensive creativity and even a bit of trickery to attain a 103-97 triumph at Madison Square Garden that extended their winning streak to four games. Bullets Stifled The defensive intensity stifled a team that appeared to have command of the contest with a 91-81 lead and two of the league's most explosive offense weapons - the Malones. Moses Malone, the center, and Jeff Malone, the guard, went into the game accounting for 47 percent of the Bullets' scoring with averages of 25.8 and 24.6 points per game, respectively. Together, they scored only one basket in the final minutes of the game and the Bullets scored only 6 points in the final 6 minutes 23 seconds. Gerald Wilkins, as is becoming his habit, supplied the offensive creativity for the Knicks. He scored 10 of his game-high 29 points in that final 6:23 as the Knicks outscored the Bullets by 22-6. Two of his baskets came on soaring bank shots high off the glass on plays that could not have been more stunning if they were made by Michael Jordan. And the trickery? That was Hill's domain. First, he employed a three-guard alignment with Gerald Henderson, Trent Tucker and Wilkins. Then he allowed Tucker and Wilkins to decide who would play small forward. And, finally, he designed a play during a timeout that allowed the 6-foot-5-inch Wilkins to take advantage of a bigger, but slower defender, the 6-8 John Williams. Worked to Perfection It all worked to perfection. Later, in the victorious locker room, talk centered on how much of an impact Hill has had on the same group of players that Brown could not affect. Would the Knicks have won this game with Brown as their coach? ''No way,'' Trent Tucker said quickly. ''First of all, me and Gerald would not have been out there together and we would not have had the freedom to decided among ourselves who would play what position. And we simply wouldn't have known how to win the game.'' ''I don't know. I can't make that assessment,'' said Rory Sparrow, who had seven assists in just 19 minutes off the bench against the Bullets. ''We are playing with a lot more confidence than we were back then. If we had won this game six weeks ago, it might have been a freak, but I think we can do this every night.'' Ewing in Foul Trouble ''The biggest thing is that we're a lot less predictable,'' said Bill Cartwright, who scored 23 of his 27 points in the first half to keep the Knicks in the contest when Patrick Ewing was held to just 5 minutes in the half because of fouls. ''We've made a lot of changes. The players laugh about it sometimes because we can't keep up with them. They're not big changes, it's just that other teams don't know what to expect from us now. It's tough to defend a team when you don't know what they're doing.'' Hill was evasive in answering the question, but he finally said that, under Brown, the Knicks ''probably wouldn't have come back like we did.'' He paused, thinking back to those times when he was an assistant coach for Brown, then re-emphasized his point. ''No question, it's all about learning how to win again. Once I'm on the sidelines, even I think we're going to win now.''"
The New York Times, TESTAVERDE IMPRESSIVE TO THE END," The woman said her name was Olga. She introduced herself to the not-so-long-ago unknown young man from Elmont, L.I., who was now being honored at a dinner in Washington. The affair was not unlike the dinners in New York, Philadelphia and Dallas. The dinners have been interspersed with television appearances in Los Angeles and New York and a conversation with the President of the United States in Washington. The appearances have taken place before and after crack-of-dawn departures from airports and nearly-middle-of-the-night arrivals in other airports. Other scheduled events have been canceled well beyond the last minute, when people were waiting. The dinners and the attention and the smiles and the handshakes and the promise of financial security the near future holds, all have been a hard-earned reward for years of obscurity. Yet the moments, all of which have somehow been compressed into the past month, have seemed a blur except for just a few, including the time in Washington when Olga sat down beside him. ''She's probably just a nice lady,'' he said that day. Olga had insisted to others that she was Vinny Testaverde's mother. Which would come as a surprise to Josephine Testaverde of Elmont, L.I., whose 23-year-old son recently left a Heisman Trophy in her home. Tomorrow evening in the Arizona desert, he can become the eighth Heisman winner to play for a champion of a news-service poll. Testaverde would be just the third to play for an undefeated, untied national champion that won a bowl game, following Davey O'Brien, the Texas Christian quarterback in 1938, and Tony Dorsett, the Pittsburgh running back in 1976. Regardless of what is eventually said of his football career, regardless of the outcome of the Fiesta Bowl game tomorrow between his University of Miami Hurricanes and Penn State, it can never be correct to say that Testaverde never had a dinner. On the outside, he appears the same friendly, polite transplanted New Yorker who had been ignored while the crowds formed next door around the locker of Bernie Kosar, his predecessor as the Hurricane quarterback. ''We were at an Italian-American banquet in Pittsburgh,'' said Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach. ''My wife said he gave her his rolls, his butter. She couldn't get over how polite and shy he was.'' Who knows what the sirens could possibly have been doing to the inside? Paterno and his recruiters have dominated Long Island in recent years, but he did not remember ever hearing the name Testaverde when the quarterback played for Sewanhaka High School. After tomorrow night, who will not have heard the name? Testaverde prepares for a football game he must know may well place a large permanent plus or minus next to his name. He has paused this week to think of responses to questions - a process he once found frightening - on topics such as the future of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the team that will soon own his professional rights, a subject that has nothing to do with his immediate existence and everything to do with what will come right around the next bend in the road. Among his other gifts, Testaverde seems to have had a talent for seeing beyond the glitz to possess an understanding of who and what he is, and an ability to sidestep a sense of self-importance as if it were just another blitzing linebacker. His need to be part of a group led him to join the camouflage-wearing platoon that descended in the desert this week. But while teammates have embarrassed themselves and their university with their us-against-the-world rhetoric, Testaverde offered how he enjoyed spending time with Shane Conlan, the Penn State linebacker. Two years ago this week, when Kosar had not yet graduated from Miami and all logical thought seemed to indicate that Testaverde's professional interests would be best served by transfering to a school that held a better opportunity to play, he chose to remain. Less than five months ago, he perceived his growing fame by saying that he thought some football fans knew the University of Miami had a quarterback from Elmont, L.I. A revision has been made necessary by the last month. ''They may not know my name,'' he said this week, ''but they know a little bit about me. They know a little bit more than they did back then. I just feel like I have a lot of friends.'' Apparently. His new acquaintances have included that old jokester, Bob Hope; an ex-football broadcaster named Ronald Reagan, and that new talk-show hostess, Joan Rivers. When he returned to school, teammates were waiting. Mike Irvin, the sophomore wide receiver, remembered with a smile: ''We said, 'Hey, Vinny, could you put down the Heisman and get ready for Penn State?' Or, 'O.K., Vinny, you know the President. Now you can come to practice with the little people.' '' ''He is at his best,'' said Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, ''and he is most relaxed, when he is on the field. He would like to get up in the morning, put on sweats, lift weights and go out and play catch.'' The process has grown far more complicated. At Johnson's suggestion, a security guard employed by the university escorts Testaverde in public this week. ''I thought it was a good idea,'' Testaverde said. ''There are a lot of people walking around. You don't know if some of them are your friends and some of them are your enemies.'' His working regimen was disrupted by the pace of the schedule and the injury from his recent motor-scooter accident. His girlfriend of several years, who last August was one of the first people Testaverde suggested could lend some insight into who he is and where he has been, is now his former girlfriend. And more and more people want to be friends. Supporters of the idea for an annual national championship college football game might do well to consider a system that has already created the need for a well-adjusted college senior to be accompanied by a security guard.

The New York Times, USX SETS $300 MILLION WRITE-OFF," The USX Corporation said yesterday that it would take a $300 million charge in the fourth quarter to retire debt from its $2.9 billion acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company in 1982. The $300 million charge is to account for the difference between the par value of the bonds and the value at which they were carried on USX's balance sheet. USX said that the action would reduce its financial costs by more than $140 million a year. The redemption will be made on March 1 for all of its 12.5 percent guaranteed notes due 1994. The company said that the redemption represented the last of the debt from the Marathon acquisition. USX said it had arranged $1 billion in loans from Citibank to finance the redemption. The loan will be secured with future earnings from Marathon's prized Yates oilfield in Texas, the company said. ''The redemption is a key element in the corporation's ongoing restructuring,'' USX's chairman, David M. Roderick, said. USX also said talks were continuing between representatives of Mr. Roderick and Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor. In October, USX received a $31-a-share, $8 billion takeover proposal from Mr. Icahn. The company declined the proposal, saying it was studying various restructuring possibilities. Mr. Roderick has maintained that the company has not yet determined what form any restructuring would take. He said a restructuring plan would be presented to the company's board by the end of January. The company has received a proposed restructuring package from Goldman, Sachs & Company, its financial advisers. USX said the options presented were numerous. USX has said it would consider a number of possibilities, including a large stock buyback, the sale of certain operations or doing nothing at all. No Mediator Recommendation The company also said yesterday that a mediator had declined to make recommendations for a settlement in a work stoppage by the United Steelworkers union that has idled USX's plants for the last five months. Earlier, USX had said it wanted recommendations by yesterday for a settlement. ''We had hoped for a recommendation by Dec. 31,'' a USX spokesman said. ''But deadlines don't seem to mean much in this business.'' Bruce Johnston, USX executive vice president, and James McGeehan, union treasurer, have been negotiating regularly with Sylvester Garrett, a steel labor specialist, since mid-December, when Mr. Garrett was brought in to end an impasse in the talks. Sources close to the negotiations said the talks would probably resume tomorrow. No progress has been reported since Mr. Garrett's appointment on Dec. 18."
The New York Times," RAJ NARAIN, 69, INDIAN SOCIALIST: HELPED DEFEAT TWO GOVERNMENTS"," Raj Narain, a colorful Socialist leader who defeated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a parliamentary election and played a key role in the fall of a successor, died of a heart attack here Tuesday night. He was 69 years old. Mr. Narain was active in the independence movement against Britain and was later imprisoned scores of times for his leadership of opposition movements. First elected to India's upper house of Parliament in 1966, Mr. Narian became known for his antics and rowdy behavior. He was sometimes asked to leave the chamber and on several occasions had to be carried out by parliamentary officers. In 1975 a high court upheld Mr. Narain's charges of electoral fraud against Mrs. Gandhi. The charges concerned a 1971 election for the lower house that Mr. Narain, who often wore a green bandana around his head, had lost by more than 100,000 votes. The verdict led to the authoritarian state of emergency that Mrs. Gandhi declared soon after, arresting thousands of critics, including Mr. Narain, and imposing news censorship. Defeated Mrs. Gandhi Nearly two years later, when Mrs. Gandhi called new elections and freed her critics, Mr. Narain and his colleagues rode a popular wave of unrest to defeat her and her Government. He won decisively in the Prime Minister's home constituency of Rae Bareli. In the new Government of Prime Minister Morarji R. Desai, an ascetic follower of Mohandas K. Gandhi, Mr. Narain was appointed Health Minister. He set about changing the policy on family planning and renounced forced sterilizations. Mr. Desai dismissed Mr. Narain and his chief ally, Home Affairs Minister Charan Singh, for working against his Janata Party Government. The governing party then comprised four opposition groups, including the Socialists, that had merged in 1977 to oppose Mrs. Gandhi. Although there was a brief reconciliation in the Janata Party, Mr. Narain later led a fierce party revolt that toppled Mr. Desai in the summer of 1979 and replaced him with Mr. Singh as Prime Minister. The new Government collapsed when Mrs. Gandhi withdrew a pledge of support, and in elections at the beginning of 1980 she swept back to power with a landslide. Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 and was succeeded by her son, Rajiv. Mr. Narain fell out with Mr. Singh after the 1980 opposition debacle and finally founded his own Socialist Party, which had few followers. He recently completed a Hindi-language movie in which he played the part of Manu, the deity who is revered as a lawmaker by pious Hindus. Mr. Narain is survived by his wife and four children."
The New York Times, A LUXURY LINE FALTERS AT G.M.," Rob Mancuso said his heart sank when the General Motors Corporation first displayed its new, downsized Cadillac Seville and Eldorado models to dealers in Las Vegas about a year ago. ''The guy next to me and I looked at each other and we said the same thing: 'They're not going to sell.' '' Unfortunately for himself and for G.M., Mr. Mancuso, a Cadillac and Honda dealer in the Chicago suburb of Barrington, Ill., was right. The two Cadillacs and their companion models, the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado, are G.M.'s biggest automotive sales flop of 1986. And because these high-priced cars (the Seville has a base sticker price of $26,326) are also among G.M.'s most profitable, their sickly sales have contributed to the company's woes. G.M.'s problems include a falling market share and a $338.5 million operating loss in the third quarter of 1986, but the four luxury models are ''the single biggest product fiasco'' in recent G.M. history, said Maryann N. Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. Sales Fall 51 Percent All four models are built on what G.M. calls its ''E/K platform.'' In 1985, the E/K's predecessors had combined sales of 161,437 in the January through November period. The total in the comparable period of 1986 slipped to 78,941, a 51 percent decline. Since the estimated profit on these models is more than $5,000 a car, industry analysts figure the slump in E/K sales will reduce G.M.'s earnings by some $500 million this year. One primary problem seems to be the belief of many drivers that they no longer need to drive smaller cars and conserve gasoline. Just as soaring gasoline prices caught G.M. and Detroit with big, gas-guzzling cars twice in the 1970's, now G.M. is trying to sell cars designed for fuel scarcity at a time when gasoline is plentiful and big cars are back in favor. When these cars were being designed, G.M. forecasters were predicting prices of $2 a gallon for gasoline; it is currently selling for closer to $1. Decline in Owner Loyalty G.M. executives acknowledge that previous buyers of Eldorados, Rivieras, Sevilles and Toronados do not like the new versions, which are smaller, lighter and less powerful -but more expensive - than those they replaced. In addition, the new models strongly resemble some of the company's lower-priced cars - a serious problem in the luxury-car market, where buyers seek distinction as much as comfort. ''Almost every Eldorado or Seville sale now has to be a 'conquest sale,' '' commented William E. Hoglund, the head of G.M.'s Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group. A conquest sale, in Detroit parlance, is one in which the buyer previously drove a competing make. ''In the past,'' Mr. Hoglund added, ''in those product lines, we relied heavily on owner loyalty.'' Meanwhile, G.M.'s competitors report strong sales of their traditional, rear-wheel-drive luxury cars. Production of Ford's Lincoln Town Car was increased during the year, and the Chrysler Corporation has arranged to use American Motors' production facilities so it could continue to build the Chrysler Fifth Avenue, a model that had been scheduled for elimination. 'Elrivado' Styling Criticized Auto industry watchers say sales of the E/K models have slumped, in part, because they share the problem of ''lookalike'' styling that has plagued other G.M. lines in recent years. Car and Driver magazine, in a review of the Buick Riviera, said it looks like a Somerset Regal - a smaller, less expensive model -''with a case of terminal swayback.'' The magazine added that for a car that is supposed to be an expression of the owner's personality, ''The new Riv is so low-key as to be invisible in a parking lot full of contemporary G.M. models.'' Other assessments were similarly unflattering. Road & Track magazine called the cars, collectively, the ''Elrivado.'' The models were so much alike, it said, it did not make sense to review them separately. Irvin W. Rybicki, who recently retired as G.M.'s vice president for design, said model lines that lacked styling distinction resulted from fears about another energy crisis, as well as G.M.'s huge conversion from rear-wheel to front-wheel drive and the pressure from management to hold down development budgets. ''With all the investments that were being made in plants and engineering, there wasn't a lot of money left for sheet metal,'' Mr. Rybicki said. Designers ''had to play the corporate game'' and accept fewer styling touches than they would have liked. Not Impressive Enough G.M. also erred, some outside analysts said, in introducing the E/K luxury cars soon after the similarly styled - but smaller and lower-priced - ''N'' platform cars: the Buick Somerset Regal, Oldsmobile Calais and Pontiac Grand Am. Traditionally, G.M. established styling trends with its more expensive cars and in later years incorporated those themes in cheaper models. Mr. Mancuso, the Illinois G.M. dealer, said prospective buyers of the Seville and Eldorado had told him the cars simply did not look impressive enough. ''They don't want them sitting in their driveway,'' he said. There has been criticism of the cars' interiors, as well. In its quest to be technically sophisticated, Buick installed a cathode-ray tube with a touch-sensitive screen in the Riviera. It monitors engine functions and controls the heating and cooling systems, the radio and cassette player and a trip computer, but it is in the middle of the instrument panel, out of the driver's line of vision. A driver who wants to change radio stations or adjust the temperature must take his eyes off the road and touch the screen one or more times to pull up the right computer ''menu'' and make the adjustment. Noting that Buick says the screen replaces 92 switches, Road & Track commented, ''After driving the Riviera for a while, even the prospect of driving a car with 92 switches was more appealing.'' Dealers and analysts add that young, technically sophisticated buyers - those who might find touch-screen controls appealing - are unlikely to shop for a Riviera because of its history as a large car with an older target audience. Larger Versions Planned Stretched versions of the E/K cars are on G.M.'s drawing boards, but because of the long lead times in the auto industry they will not be available until late 1988 as 1989 models. In the meantime, in a move to balance supply with sales, G.M. is cutting production from two shifts to one at its showplace assembly plant on the border of Detroit and Hamtramck. By cutting production, G.M. may be able to avoid the costly incentives it would need to sell an oversupply of the models - but it also means the overhead of the $1 billion, automation-packed plant will be spread over fewer cars, squeezing G.M.'s profit margin. G.M. executives are also trying different marketing strategies to sell the cars available now. Cadillac cut the price of 1987 Sevilles and Eldorados by about 6 percent, and added equipment to the Buick and Oldsmoble models while holding the price line. Buick also added a travel incentive, promising Riviera buyers two airline tickets to any destination served by Trans World Airlines until Feb. 28. Mr. Hoglund said that until the 1989 models arrive, G.M.'s basic strategy is to use special marketing programs to induce sales prospects to take test drives. Once inside the cars, the hope is that customers will think less about the size and styling and be impressed by the ride, handling and appointments. ''If somebody has a better solution, I'd like to hear it,'' Mr. Hoglund said."
The New York Times, Beverly Plans Restructuring," Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home operator, has announced a restructuring program that includes the sale of some long-term care facilities, the sale of most of its retirement living centers and the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of common stock. Beverly, based in Pasadena, Calif., also announced the acquisition of 69 long-term care facilities with about 7,500 beds in Arkansas and Texas from a subsidiary of Stephens Inc. Stephens will get about $100 million stated value of a new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock for the facilities, which Beverly leases. The restructuring plan calls for Beverly to slow its acquisition program from 13,500 beds annually to between 3,000 and 5,000 beds in 1987 and includes the sale of some of the company's durable medical equipment operations. Robert Van Tuyle, chairman and chief executive, said the company planned to focus on its long-term care facilities."

The New York Times," Oil Hits $18 a Barrel, Highest Since February"," Crude oil futures touched the $18-a-barrel mark yesterday for the first time since February, continuing a run-up touched off by the recent agreement of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production. The gains were trimmed a bit near the close. ''Prices continue to advance on the belief that the OPEC agreement is going to work,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc. Although the upward price move had ultimately met resistance, he said, ''the market is still giving OPEC a strong vote of confidence for its efforts.'' West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 29 cents higher, with the February contract at $17.94 a barrel; heating oil was 0.76 cent to 1.11 cents higher, with February at 49.95 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.70 cent to 1.24 cents higher, with February at 49.34 cents a gallon. Precious metals futures also surged yesterday. The metals were helped by the strong advance of energy futures, signaling the possibility of greater inflation, according to Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. She said that relatively thin trading accentuated the moves. Gold futures soared as the dollar weakened after the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit totaled a record $19.2 billion in November, she said. The market had been expecting the figure to be near $13 billion. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $14.50 to $15.10 higher, with the contract for delivery in January at $404.90 an ounce. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $11.70 to $12.70 higher, with the January contract at $470.70 an ounce. FUTURES/OPTIONS"
The New York Times, BOTHA ANNOUNCES EARLY WHITE VOTE," President P. W. Botha announced tonight that there would be early general elections next year for the nation's white electorate. The move, political commentators said, was designed to win a renewed mandate for the Afrikaner National Party after 28 months of black revolt, mounting international ostracism and increasing reliance on emergency rule to withstand demands for black majority rule. The party has been in power since 1948. Mr. Botha, who made the announcement in a televised New Year's message, said he would announce a date for the election in January. Press commentators, who have been speculating about an election for months, have suggested that it will be held in mid-March. Elections were not expected until 1989. In the broadcast, Mr. Botha set an electioneering tone, seeking to rally white voters by condemning Western powers, including the United States, for hypocrisy toward his land and by vowing that his Government was ''not prepared to sacrifice our right of self-determination in our fatherland.'' A Promise to Whites The language represented a coded promise to the white minority of five million that their Afrikaner leaders would not hand over the country to a black government drawn from majority rule based on an unqualified, universal franchise. Mr. Botha made no announcement of new elections for the two junior houses in the country's segregated three-chamber Parliament - those occupied by legislators of mixed and Indian racial descent. Those legislatures were chosen in elections in 1984 marked by widespread abstentions and the first stirrings of the nation's violence and protest, which have claimed 2,300 lives since September 1984. ''I think the time to consult the white electorate on a number of fundamental issues is fast approaching,'' he said in his broadcast. ''By-elections should in any event have been held in the near future in a number of constituencies. It is consequently preferable to hold a general election for the House of Assembly in the coming year.'' Mr. Botha did not say whether the vote would be held under the nation's newest emergency decree, in force since June 12, which makes it an offense to oppose or resist the authorities in their handling of the nation's crisis. Program Is Stalled South African political commentators have suggested that Mr. Botha, aged 70 years and reportedly concerned about his health, wishes to cement his party in power among white voters before stepping down and leaving to others the job of continuing his program of cautious racial reform. That program has all but stalled in the nation's unrest. While the authorities have scrapped some apartheid legislation, such as the pass laws inhibiting black access to the fringes of white cities, they have balked at further changes in such laws as those that segregate schools and residential areas. Referring to foreign pressures on his Government to accelerate change, Mr. Botha declared tonight, ''We dare not yield to the irresponsible and often superficial demands which will destroy everything created over so many decades by so many generations.'' In an evident reference to sanctions by the United States and other Western countries and economic pressures such as divestment, he said, ''Actions taken against us have been totally counterproductive.'' 'This Incredible Haste' Mr. Botha said it took the United States from 1776 to 1870 ''to complete their Constitution and grant civil liberties to its black minority community, and another century and a fierce civil rights struggle to insure that those rights were more than theoretical rights.'' ''Even after that, further amendments were necessary,'' he said. ''So I put this question - why all this incredible and unnatural haste with the multi-cultural South Africa with our vast historical differences and traditions? ''The course on which certain Western powers have now embarked directly serves the interests of the forces who do not seriously believe in democratic principles. These hypocritical forces do not want to have a negotiated, peaceful solution in South Africa.'' ''If they are allowed to play their present game, it can only result in the establishment of a tyrannical dictatorship in this country,'' he said. ''That we will oppose with a determined national will.''

The New York Times," HASSIDIC MAN, HURT IN A RACIAL ATTACK LAST SUMMER, DIES"," A Hasidic man who was beaten to unconciousness by a group of black teen-agers on a Brooklyn subway platform last summer died Saturday of his injuries, the police said yesterday. The incident came to light yesterday when Mayor Koch issued a statement deploring the death as ''the consequence of another act of violent hate.'' Mr. Koch said he issued the statement at the request of members of the Hasidic community of the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. The Hasidim said that they were concerned about the lack of publicity about the death of the Jewish man in comparison to that about the racial incident in Howard Beach, Queens, that led to the death of Michael Griffith. Mr. Griffith, a black man from Brooklyn, was struck by a car on Dec. 20 after he fled a group of white attackers, according to the police. 'Is Jewish Blood Cheaper?' ''We agree that Howard Beach is terrible,'' said Rabbi Israel Rosenfeld, the director of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council. ''We don't condone Howard Beach, but why is Jewish blood any cheaper than black blood?'' According to the police, the victim, Israel Rosen, 49 years old, was hit over the head repeatedly with a wooden club while waiting for a train at the Kingston Avenue IRT station, at Eastern Parkway, at about 9 P.M. on July 2. His assailants, the police said, were five or six black youths, who fled without taking anything from the victim. Capt. Donald Bromberg, the commanding officer of the police department's Bias Incident Investigating Unit, said that the beating was investigated as a racial incident because of the different ethnic backgrounds of the attackers and the victim and ''because we were unable to find any other motive.'' Mr. Rosen, who had a beard, was dressed in the dark garb characteristic of Hasidic men. Reward Was Offered The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York and its constituent council in Crown Heights offered a $5,000 reward in the case."
The New York Times, Two Check-Cashers Found Shot to Death," Two employees of a Bronx check-cashing service were found shot to death Tuesday night in their street-level corner store in what the police called an apparent robbery. The victims, employees of the Home Check Cashing Corporation, were found dead inside the locked and shuttered store at 25 West 170th Street, at Inwood Avenue, shortly after 11:30 P.M. Both died of shotgun wounds, the police said. The victims, Valdamar Barrea, 40 years old, and Varghese Ninan, 35, both of Yonkers, were found behind an intact bullet-proof partition, according to the police, who said it was unclear how the intruder got behind the barrier. The police said they believed they were shot at about 6 P.M., the store's usual closing hour. A police spokesman, Officer Peter O'Donnell, said the police had been summoned by a company supervisor who saw the employees' cars parked outside. A safe was found open with only coins in it, the police said, adding that an audit was being performed to see if any cash was taken. METRO DATELINES"
The New York Times, COLUMN ONE: Clean Air; U.S. Presses City To Cut Pollutants," Welcome to 1987, the year that New York's traffic and environmental planners must clear the air or face the Federal music. The refrain that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency plans to sound this year is familiar but unpleasant. New York City violates Federal Clean Air Act standards for two primary pollutants, ozone and carbon monoxide, both of which have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular ailments. Bring down levels of the pollutants by the Dec. 31, 1987, deadline or suffer the consequences. On paper, those consequences are serious: more than $300 million in Federal highway funds can be withheld, in addition to critical financing for sewage treatment plants and other capital projects. Whether the E.P.A. will actually impose the sanctions, however, is doubtful. Even the most optimistic officials say New York and about 30 other cities nationwide have little or no chance of meeting the deadline. The best bet, according to city, state and Federal officials, is that the E.P.A. will require the city only to produce a plan showing that deadlines will eventually be met. The Commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Harvey W. Schultz, said that meeting that goal will require many studies and long hours. ''It's not going to be an easy year,'' said Mr. Schultz. 'Menu of Options' Perhaps the most unsavory task has fallen to the city's Transportation Commissioner, Ross Sandler. Mr. Sandler has been put in charge of devising ways to cut traffic in the city and thus bring down the emissions that cause high levels of carbon monoxide. Having carted around his ''menu of options'' for reducing congestion through the city, Mr. Sandler now says his department will make its choices by the end of the month. Drastic options like banning private cars have been dropped, but these are among a long list of remedies remaining in the running: * ''Congestion pricing.'' Requiring drivers to pay daily or monthly fees for using their cars in Manhattan south of 60th Street during busy hours. * Restricted license plate entry. Those cars with license plates ending in odd and even numbers would be alternately allowed to enter Manhattan. * Banning single-occupant vehicles from entering Manhattan. * Tougher restrictions on trucks, double parking and delivery times. * Heavier reliance on traffic agents to speed traffic. Mr. Sandler and others argue that reducing the number of cars with idling engines will eliminate the city's 80 carbon-monoxide hot spots. Opponents, such as the director of the Clean Air Campaign, Marcy Benstock, disagree: ''The more traffic you move rapidly,'' she said, ''the more you encourage to come in.'' Developers' Anxiety New York's real-estate developers, whose buildings generate traffic, are also approaching the Clean Air deadlines with some anxiety. According to Mr. Schultz, three projects in downtown Brooklyn, the proposed Citicorp development in Queens, and elements of the Times Square redevelopment plan have all been slowed by the requirements of environmental studies. Late last year the regional administrator of the E.P.A., Christopher J. Daggett, fired his first warning shot when he rejected guarantees that a new hotel complex in downtown Brooklyn, the Renaissance Plaza, would meet clean air standards sometime in the 1990's. Mr. Daggett sent the developers back to the drawing board to conduct further studies. Members of the powerful New York Real Estate Board, meanwhile, worry that community activists might find a useful weapon in the approaching deadlines. ''The statute,'' said Warren Wechsler, the board's vice president, ''could be used by parties that are resisting development rather than interested in air quality.'' Ms. Benstock of the Clean Air Campaign counters that developers should only be allowed to build in areas with easy access to mass transit. A Court Action The city's environmental advocates, meanwhile, are not waiting for the deadline to come and go. The leading watchdog group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, will go to court later this month, charging that the city, state and Federal authorities are failing to follow state plans for reducing pollutants. According to the council's senior attorney, Eric Goldstein, state plans to reduce the levels of ozone - formed when gas vapors and other hydrocarbons react with sunlight and heat -have not been followed. Top on the forgotten list, he says, is a plan to control the release of gasoline vapors at service stations. He also knocks the state for failing to finish studies on the impact of industrial sources of ozone production, such as auto painting shops and commercial solvent producers. State and city officials reject Mr. Goldstein's assertions, but Mr. Daggett, the regional E.P.A. administrator, acknowledges that timetables have slipped. But as 1986 gives way to 1987, he promised, the E.P.A. will not hesitate ''to turn the screws tighter.''"
The New York Times, LUMBER PACT WITH U.S. IS CRITICIZED IN CANADA," Canadian lumber industry executives today condemned an agreement that will set aside a 15 percent United States tariff penalty on Canadian softwood exports to the United States and replace it with a 15 percent Canadian export tax. The executives were joined by politicians opposed to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Government, which reached the agreement in Washington late Tuesday under the pressure of a midnight deadline set under United States trade law. The agreement will apply to Canadian exports that captured 32 percent of the United States softwood market in 1985, at a value of about $2.9 billion. Industry analysts here forecast that the new export tax will reverse a trend that has seen Canada widening its American market share in recent years, as layoffs and bankruptcies have increased in the United States softwood industry. American companies, contending that low fees in Canada for timber cutting amounted to an unfair subsidy, led the fight for a tariff penalty that resulted in a Commerce Department ruling that imposed the 15 percent import levy. Critics here had argued that Canada should resist increased softwood levies and should carry the issue into international trade tribunals if necessary. The Government, although bristling, decided to go for a quick settlement that would keep the increased duties, amounting to an estimated $435 million, in Canada. In addition, the officials wished to avoid a final ruling by the Commerce Department that they feared might encourage similar petitions by other American industries facing strong Canadian imports. The announcement of the accord was greeted with satisfaction in official quarters. The Forestry Minister, Gerald Merrithew, said that it had avoided a potentially damaging precedent for Canadian industries, while the Premier of British Columbia, William Vander Zalm, whose province accounts for 70 percent of the softwood exports involved in the dispute, maintained that any damage would lie mainly with United States consumers faced with higher prices. ''Life will go on,'' Mr. Vander Zalm said. ''The forest companies, I'm sure, will survive and continue to log and mill and do all of the wonderful things that create employment.'' This view was bitterly contested, however, by spokesmen for some of the companies affected. ''It's bizarre, it's sickening,'' said Adam Zimmerman, president of MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of the country's largest forest products companies. 'An Industrial Paraplegic' Mr. Zimmerman, who is chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council, said that the Washington agreement had made ''an industrial paraplegic'' of Canadian lumber companies and threatened to wipe out their entire profits at a stroke. Other critics contended that the agreement would throw as many as 20,000 Canadians out of work, set a precedent for future American interference with the pricing of Canadian natural resources and encourage protectionist forces that have made this a troubled year in Canada-United States trade. ''Whether we're talking about the export of wood products, pork, corn, tubular steel, fish, any major Canadian export now is subject to this kind of action by the United States,'' said Edward Broadbent, leader of the New Democratic Party, which is heavily backed by labor unions. After announcing that Canada would put the new tax in effect on Jan. 8, officials here were critical of President Reagan's decision to impose a bridging levy of 15 percent on the Canadian imports until the new tax takes effect. A senior official in Ottawa, speaking on a background basis, called the President's action ''a bit of greed and haste.'' Beyond all this, opponents of the deal said that it cast a pall over the Mulroney Government's initiative to liberalize the rules governing trade between the two countries, the world's largest trading partners. The broad trade initiative, explored in talks that began last May, have run into major obstacles that have raised doubts about the prospects for an accord before a September 1987 deadline set by Congress. Hostile Feelings The trade tensions have generated hostile feelings among many Canadians who generally are well disposed toward the United States. Even Mr. Mulroney, whose Government's fortunes rest heavily on the attempt to negotiate a broad trade deal with Washington, has spoken about his doubts that the United States appreciates ''its friends.'' The Mulroney administration had been buffeted by a United States decision in May to impose a stiff tariff on Canadian cedar shakes and shingles, a major British Columbia export, and had retaliated with a range of tariffs on American imports as varied as computer parts and Christmas trees. Then, in October, Canada slapped a countervailing duty of about 70 percent on American corn imports, saying that United States farm policies amounted to unfair subsidization.  U.S. APPLAUDS PACT WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Special To The New York Times) - Reagan Administration officials applauded the agreement with Canada that ended the often contentious lumber dispute, which had threatened to derail broader free trade negotiations between the two countries. ''We commend the negotiators on both sides of the border,'' said S. Bruce Smart Jr., Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade administration. ''The solution successfully addresses the problem,'' added Alan Woods, deputy United States trade representative."
The New York Times, 'ALTAR OF PEACE' DEDICATED AT CATHEDRAL," A longtime dream for the woodworker George Nakashima was realized last night when his ''Altar for Peace,'' a heart-shaped work in English walnut and rosewood, was dedicated at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. ''We had a fair amount of difficulty transporting it - it was a wide load,'' the 81-year-old master woodworker said of the three-quarter-ton altar, which made the trip from his workshop in Bucks County, Pa., to the cathedral on a 40-foot flatbed truck. About 5,000 people gathered in the cathedral on New Year's Eve, where they heard the blessing and dedication of the altar as part of the cathedral's fourth annual Concert for Peace. Heralded by trumpets and shrouded in incense, Mr. Nakashima joined a procession through the cathedral to the nave, where the altar had been placed. In his remarks, Mr. Nakashima said that the symbolic genesis of the altar ''was perhaps a thousand years ago in Japan, the time when the great forests with huge trees existed and the spirit of union of man and nature was deep and real.'' Having heard that the vast Gothic space was a bit drafty, Mr. Nakashima, was atypically clad in a three-piece suit rather than his traditional Japanese wrapped coat. Mr. Nakashima, who said earlier that he intended the altar as a ''tangible'' symbol for the peace movement, told the crowd ''if we can contribute something to the stability of this world, it would be fulfilling.'' Financed largely by Mr. Nakashima, the altar, which cost about $10,000, is the final chapter of a saga that began three years ago, when one of Mr. Nakashima's loggers procured the tree from a Long Island estate. It took a week to cut the log with an eight-foot chain saw. After two years of air and kiln drying the logs, Mr. Nakashima spent another two and a half months building the altar, which was carefully planed and sanded and then finished with Mr. Nakashima's trademark butterfly rosewood inlays. The altar, on top of which rests a bonsai tree, is flanked by two menorahs, a Moslem prayer rug and two Shinto vases, in keeping with the cathedral's mission as ''a house of prayer for all nations.'' Also dedicated last night was an eternal flame from Hiroshima and a 14-foot painted cross by Carlos Sanchez Arias entitled ''The Crucifixion of Nicaragua.'' The concert itself featured a prayer read by the actress Ellen Burstyn and remarks by the conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, who gave a rendition of his own seasonal satirical rap song, ''Gift Wrap.'' ''Let us commit ourselves, yet once again, to the vision of racial harmony and justice in this city,'' the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the Dean of the Cathedral, said in a special prayer for peace. ''We know by now where such discord can lead. We know by now that we must overcome. We must be one people in the city of New York. Let this be a special message from this gathering to our fellow New Yorkers on this New Year's Eve.''"
The New York Times," BORN IN '00, THEY AWAIT NEW YEAR"," It's been quite a century, so far, for Lucia Radl, Mabel Brown, Arthur Linksz, Annie Flanagan and Meyer Greenberg. Each intends to turn 87 years old in 1987. And having survived it all since 1900, each can claim - perhaps more than most Americans - a certain proprietary right to the 20th century. Not that it has been easy. As they looked back on what has been wrought in their time, they turned to words bearing the weight of great upheaval - revolution, world wars, a Great Depression, a Holocaust, civil rights, women's liberation. They have seen it all - the automobile, the airplane, radio, television, the computer, the hydrogen bomb and the space age. ''Resilient,'' said Dr. Radl, a Manhattan psychiatrist, when asked how she faced what she had to face. ''How can you survive if you are not resilient?'' 'Get Me a Bottle of Rum' And yesterday afternoon, Miss Brown, who lives in Harlem, knew exactly how she would face the start of another New Year. ''Going to get me a bottle of rum and just be right here in my house,'' she said. ''Going to sit up until they drop the ball. And when they do I'll jump up, shout 'Hallelujah,' clap hands and thank God for me being here.'' For Dr. Linksz, a retired Manhattan ophthalmologist who has written two books since turning 80, it all began in a time of crowned heads, prancing steeds and gilt-edged coaches. ''The years from 1900 to 1914, they were the last years of the Hapsburg monarchy,'' said Dr. Linksz, who grew up in a tiny town on the plains of Hungary. ''The peasant still tilled the soil. And optimism was great. But it turned out to be not justified.  ''There were great expectations,'' he said. ''Technical progress was supposed to be the salvation of mankind.'' That, he said, was long before the Nazis perfected the technology of mass murder and, among the millions, killed many members of his family. Dr. Linksz recalled the advent of the airplane. ''Only the angels were supposed to fly,'' he said. ''Nobody expected that the first airplane would mean so much change, but it did. My father would say that each night the soul flies into God's lap. That's what we knew about flying.'' In all her years, Mrs. Flanagan ''has never been on a plane. And I never drove a car.'' She was too young then, she said, and too old now. ''In them days, most people didn't have cars.'' Mrs. Flanagan, who now lives in Flushing, Queens, came to the United States in 1921 from County Mayo, Ireland. ''There was 10 children in my family,'' she said, ''but, of course, there was 10 to 12 in every family. There wasn't enough jobs to go around, so this was the best country to come to.'' Mrs. Flanagan remembers ''the uprising of 1916. It was against the British. It was always against the British. There was always fighting there, you get used to it.'' Cannon echo in the memory of Dr. Radl. ''I was born in Odessa, Russia, on the Black Sea,'' she said. ''In 1905, I experienced the bombardment of Odessa by the ship, Potemkin. The sailors had started a revolution'' - a hint of the overthrow of the Czars to come - ''but it was not successful. ''We lived through the revolution and the First World War,'' Dr. Radl said. ''I heard and saw the fighting in the street. I was 18. Too much war and revolution and killing.'' Mr. Greenberg came uncomfortably close to war during his decades as a merchant seaman. He worked on the convoys crossing the Atlantic during both world wars. Mr. Greenberg grew up, and still lives, in Brooklyn. ''I remember the gangsters that congregated around the Brooklyn Navy Yard,'' he said. ''They played cards and they wore big diamond rings all polished up meticulously. I remember all the speakeasies and the bootlegging; the smuggling across Gravesend Bay in fast speedboats, bringing in liquor.'' His life at sea ''was hard,'' Mr. Greenberg said, ''because the unions were weak at that time. Oh, is it hard work - handling heavy owsers and wire cables to tie up the vessel.'' And, during the wars, it was frightening. ''I went across with the big convoys,'' he said. ''A hundred or more ships carrying the vehicles, the ammunition and the troops. We were always suspicious of submarines underneath, aircraft overhead. We had ashcans on the stern of the vessel, filled with bombs, depth charges.'' It was just luck, he said, that kept him safe. ''At Murmansk,'' he said - referring to the Soviet port where Allied aid was off-loaded - ''the submarines were picking off the merchant ships one after another.'' Between the wars, Dr. Radl, who came to the United States in 1939, fought another kind of battle. ''In 1920, I was studying medicine,'' she said. ''I chose a male-dominated profession. In a way, I was a pioneer. 'You Better Be a Cook' ''Later on, when I was a doctor, if I wanted to be in the operating room, they pushed me away. Even when I came here to the United States, and I went for financial help, they said, 'We have enough doctors, you better be a cook.' I said, 'No way, this is what I'm going to be.' '' Miss Brown, meanwhile, was fighting a somewhat similar battle. ''Yes indeed,'' she said, when asked whether there was racism - even lynchings - when she was a small girl in Macon, Ga. ''The white people down there, you worked for them, but don't get in their way and don't say nothing wrong. If you say something wrong, they kill you just like they kill a cat. ''You have to say, 'Yes, Ma'am' and 'No, Ma'am,' '' Miss Brown said. ''But I never said 'Yes, Ma'am' and 'No, Ma'am' to none of them, because I didn't think they were no better than me. That's right.'' Mrs. Flanagan, who worked as a domestic for most of her years in America, said she thought New York ''was much nicer years go.'' Neighborliness was evident, she said, when someone on the block came home with one of those big, cardboard crates. ''Not everyone had a television then,'' Mrs. Flanagan said. ''I remember, we used to go to other people's houses.'' Back then, she said, ''There was no robberies, no killings. There was no such thing as locking doors.'' Still, at almost 87, Mrs. Flanagan has much to be happy about. ''My grandchildren, they keep me going,'' she said. ''I'm living my life over again with them. You don't sit home worrying about your pains. They make you laugh.'' Mr. Greenberg keeps himself young by ''doing all the good I can for other people. In so doing I help myself,'' he said. ''The Lord loves that.'' And Dr. Radl remains ''an optimist.'' ''I hope that there will be survival in spite of the nuclear age,'' she said. ''We don't need so much upheaval.''"
The New York Times, REAGAN PLANS TO ASK CONGRESS TO RESTORE CONTRIBUTION TO U.N.," President Reagan has told Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that he will ask Congress to restore millions of dollars in financial cuts that pushed the United Nations close to bankruptcy, United Nations and American officials said today. According to the officials, Mr. Reagan spoke to Mr. Perez de Cuellar after praising organizational changes recently adopted by the General Assembly, which included giving the major donor nations a bigger voice in United Nations spending. Mr. Reagan's comments, which he made nine days ago, were made public today at the United Nations. ''The United Nations took an historic step to adopt sweeping reforms of its organization and methods of operation,'' Mr. Reagan said. Noting that his Administration had long pushed for such changes, the President added, ''We are very pleased that these measures have finally been adopted.'' United Nations officials say they regard Mr. Reagan's statement as the clearest indication of the Administration's support for the United Nations in the aftermath of extensive Congressional budget cuts that plunged the organization into the worst financial crisis of its 41-year history. The United States owes the United Nations $110 million of its $210 million assessment for 1986, or more than 10 percent of the United Nations budget of $800 million. Congress cited the need for organizational change as justification for the cuts. The resolution passed by the Assembly included a key demand of the United States: that the big donors have a larger voice in deciding how the United Nations spends its money. To accomplish this goal, it gives the 21-nation Committee for Program and Coordination a key role in preparing the budget. The committee will now receive budget proposals a year in advance, set a ceiling on the budget, decide on its content and set a limit on appropriations that could be later added on by the Assembly. All of these decisions are supposed to be made unanimously, or by consensus. This would give each of the committee members a veto, and thus more power to major donors like the United States represented on the committee. Until now, each of the 159 member states of the Assembly had one vote on budget matters. 'Has Not Gone Unnoticed' The chief United Nations spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said of Mr. Reagan's statement: ''This is the most positive statement of support for the U.N. to come out of the Reagan Administration. We're delighted to see that the genuine effort at reform has not gone unnoticed.'' Secretary General Perez de Cuellar, who has sharply criticized the Reagan Administration for what he said was the failure to pay its dues and the breaking of its commitment to live up to the United Nations Charter, also praised Mr. Reagan's statement today. ''I am satisfied with the positive reaction of the U.S. Administration,'' Mr. Giuliani quoted the Secretary General as saying. ''I'm counting on the efforts of the Administration to obtain the necessary funding for the United Nations.'' One American official said that after the Assembly approved the package of organizational changes, ''There was a sea change in attitudes'' in the Administration. President Reagan was pleased by the changes, and he telephoned Mr. Perez de Cuellar on Dec. 22 to congratulate him on the package, which was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly three days earlier after months of often bitter closed-door debate. ''Mr. Reagan expressed satisfaction at what had happened during the General Assembly,'' Mr. Perez de Cuellar said. ''He said he hoped it would enable him to go to Congress to obtain necessary funds.'' Warm Welcome by Bush In addition, when the General Assembly President, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh, visited Washington on Dec. 22, he was warmly received by Vice President Bush, who expressed appreciation for his efforts in pushing through the package, said Richard C. Hottelet, chief spokesman at the United States Mission. In his statement, Mr. Reagan greeted the changes as a key mechanism for strengthening the United Nations, which both the Administration and Congress have repeatedly criticized for fiscal irresponsibility, a bloated bureaucracy and anti-Americanism. ''These reforms are designed to strengthen the organization's effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out its important political, economic and social objectives,'' Mr. Reagan said."
The New York Times, LAW CHANGES INCLUDE A CUT IN INCOME TAX," New Yorkers will see their state taxes cut, have the right to inspect their medical records and pay a fee for driving all-terrain vehicles under new laws that take effect today. These are just a few of the measures the Legislature passed last year and Governor Cuomo signed into law. In addition, a public authority with the power to buy the Long Island Lighting Company and bar the Shoreham nuclear plant from opening will be created on Jan. 15. Also, the State Comptroller will be empowered to withdraw state pension fund money invested in American companies operating in Northern Ireland that do not help fight religious discrimination against the Catholic minority. The state's pension funds now hold $797 million worth of stock in 12 American companies with operations in Northern Ireland. What may have the greatest effect on New Yorkers' pocketbooks is $1.65 billion in tax relief, the third phase of a state tax cut enacted in 1985. Under the law, the maximum rate on earned income will drop to 9 percent from 9.5 percent. The personal exemption increases to $900 from $850. The Legislature and Mr. Cuomo are expected to struggle during the year over how to return an expected windfall of state revenues that will result from changes in the Federal tax laws. The Governor's office has estimated the windfall between $1.2 billion and $2 billion, while the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, has put the amount closer to $2.4 billion. Another state agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles, will charge drivers of all-terrain vehicles a $10 annual registration fee and a $3.25 one-time license plate fee. New Yorkers needing medical assistance will have the right to inspect and obtain copies of records in doctors' offices, hospital charts, X-ray results and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Most hospitals and doctors have not made a patient's medical records available. The new law does not apply to patients in psychiatric hospitals, institutions for the mentally disabled and alcohol and drug treatment. The are among other new laws that start today: * Consumers who sign dating service contracts will be able to cancel within three business days. * Employers and their insurance companies who intentionally try to delay hearings on workers' compensation claims face mandatory fines of $100 for each hearing delay. * Motorists who pass stopped school buses where children are boarding or leaving face stiffer fines and longer jail terms. * Hotels, motels and lodging houses are required, effective Jan. 17, to make available smoke-detecting devices that warn deaf and hearing-impaired guests. * Leashed dogs approved by the State Department of Environmental Conservation will be allowed to track down dead or wounded deer and bears at the start of the 1987 hunting season."
The New York Times," ALAN TEMPLE, 90, EX-BANK OFFICIAL"," Alan Harrison Temple, a leading private economist and banker who retired as vice chairman of the First National City Bank of New York in 1961, died last Thursday at the King Street Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. He was 90 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y. As vice chairman of the board of trustees of Columbia University, he also was deeply involved in meeting the challenge posed by the campus unrest of 1968. He headed a special trustee committee whose recommendations resulted in the first revision of the university's charter since 1810. For most of his tenure at the bank, now known as Citibank, Mr. Temple was the guiding light of its Monthly Letter on Business and Economic Conditions. Started in 1904 as a modest throwaway for customers interested in Treasury securities, it grew after World War II into an influential authority on the American economy. Honored by Journalism Alumni By 1955 the letter reached nearly 250,000 people, many important decision-makers, in 116 countries. The following year the alumni association of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism honored him with an award for distinguished service. A 1917 graduate of from Columbia College, he had majored in journalism. Mr. Temple, a native of Templeville, Md., joined what was then the then National City Bank of New York in 1931 as assistant statistician after managing and editing the publication Commerce & Finance for 12 years. He was promoted to the post of bank statistician a year later. He became a vice president in 1941 and, as the bank's economist, rose to executive vice president in 1952. His position made him the bank's senior officer in charge of the economics department and the monthly newsletter. He retired after five years as a director and three years as vice chairman but continued in several other corporate directorships with the bank. In 1963, the bank recalled him to serve on its board of trustees and investment policy committee. Influential Role at Columbia Mr. Temple was a past chairman of the National Economic Conference Board. He was elected a trustee at Columbia in 1959 and became a trustee, as well as secretary and treasurer, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1961. The Columbia campus, like some other campuses on both sides of the Atlantic, erupted in unrest the spring of 1968, culminating in a long sit-in. Mr. Temple had planned to retire as a trustee that year, but amid the campus disorder, the board asked him, as vice chairman, to form a special study panel on restructuring the university. Mr. Temple is survived by a son, Alan H. Jr. of Pittsford, N.Y.; two daughters, Anne Temple Crumm of Cambridge, Mass., and Nancy Temple Hammond of Fairfield, Conn.; 11 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren."
The New York Times, SANTUCCI IS SAID TO WEIGH GIVING CASE TO THE U.S.," Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci, who has been stymied in his efforts to prosecute the Howard Beach case, is considering asking Federal authorities to take on the death of Michael Griffith as a civil-rights violation, city law-enforcement officals said yesterday. They said Mr. Santucci was considering this step because it would be easier to gather evidence and convict the defendants under Federal law than state law. Mr. Griffith, a black man, was struck and killed by a car on the Shore Parkway in Howard Beach on Dec. 20 after he fled a gang of white youths who had beaten him and two other blacks, according to the police. The man Mr. Santucci has called the key witness in the case, Cedric Sandiford, Mr. Griffith's stepfather, was also beaten. Mr. Sandiford's lawyer has said the witness would not cooperate with Mr. Santucci's office because its investigation was in bad faith and included a cover-up, a charge the prosecutor and other city officials deny. Ease of Prosecution The lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., at a meeting with reporters yesterday in Brooklyn, said Mr. Sandiford would cooperate with a Federal investigation of the case, just as he would with an inquiry by a special state prosecutor appointed by the Governor - an appointment called for by the lawyers. Under Federal civil-rights law, it would be easier to prosecute the three white teen-agers who now face reckless endangerment charges in the attack, as well as others who might be charged, in view of Mr. Sandiford's lack of cooperation, said the city law-enforcement officials, who declined to be identified. They said this was so because Federal immunity and conspiracy laws make it easier to gain and use the testimony of accomplices in the crime than state laws do. The officials further said that the penalties for a Federal civil-rights conviction in a case in which the violation caused a death could be up to life in prison, the same maximum as for a murder conviction under the New York State penal code. Although the officials did not say so, a Federal prosecution would permit Mr. Santucci to extricate himself from a situation in which he has been unable to move forward on an emotional case that has captured the city's attention. Murder, manslaughter and assault charges Mr. Santucci's office brought against the three arrested teen-agers were thrown out by a Queens judge Monday. The judge, Ernest Bianchi of Criminal Court in Queens, acted after finding that the evidence that prosecutors presented at a hearing, at which Mr. Sandiford did not testify, was insufficient to sustain those charges and sufficient only to sustain charges of reckless endangerment. City law-enforcement authorities also said that if the Federal prosecutors took over the case and sought Mr. Sandiford's cooperation, it would put his lawyer, Alton H. Maddox Jr., under ''great pressure'' to advise his client to cooperate with the Federal inquiry. Mr. Maddox and another lawyer working with him, C. Vernon Mason, could not immediately be reached for comment on the report that Mr. Santucci was considering requesting a Federal civil-rights prosecution. The reports came late yesterday afternoon, after the lawyers had held a news conference on the case in Brooklyn. They have been calling for Governor Cuomo to appoint a special state prosecutor to take over the case. No Confirmation Mr. Santucci's office declined to confirm that he was considering asking for a Federal civil-rights prosecution. Aides to Mr. Santucci who declined to be identified said he would still prefer to have his office prosecute the case. They said Mr. Santucci still hoped Mr. Sandiford and his lawyer would change their mind and cooperate with the office so that it might seek to have a grand jury reinstate the murder, manslaughter and assault charges that Judge Bianchi dismissed. Without Mr. Sandiford, Mr. Santucci's aides have insisted, their chance of obtaining an indictment on those charges, let alone a conviction, remains slim. City law-enforcement officials said Mr. Santucci's office could proceed with a state prosecution even after Federal authorities began a prosecution of their own, but the city officials noted that problems of double jeopardy could then be encountered. The chief assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Laurence Urgenson, whose office would prosecute a Federal civil rights case, said Federal authorities had made no decision yet on whether to ''go ahead with a Federal case.'' He said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had begun a ''preliminary investigation'' into the assault and Mr. Griffith's highway death and that his office had ''been in touch'' with Mr. Santucci's office during the last week. But he said neither Mr. Santucci nor his aides had asked for a Federal prosecution and that ''it would be premature'' to conclude that it would be easier to prosecute this case under Federal civil rights statutes than under state criminal laws. He said the F.B.I. began its inquiry at the request of the Justice Department's civil rights division in Washington, which made the request on the basis of news reports of the case. Regarding conspiracy law, the city officials said, an accomplice's testimony must be corroborated by other evidence - testimony by a nonaccomplice or physical evidence - if it is to be used in a state prosecution, whereas it need not be corroborated to be used in a Federal prosecution."
The New York Times, HOMELESS WORKING MEN GET THEIR OWN SHELTER," For more than a year, Shawn Bateza has been living in the city's shelters for the homeless and trying to hold down a job. But in the cavernous rooms where most men are housed, it is often hard to sleep. ''There are radios blasting all the time,'' Mr. Bateza said. ''Guys are fighting. Some of them are crazy.'' And there is no way to get breakfast before 7 A.M., or to accept late-night overtime without risking the loss of his bed. In a new shelter in Brooklyn, the city is trying to make it is easier for homeless men to hold down jobs -often the first step toward getting out of the shelter system. These days, Mr. Bateza, who is a bicycle messenger, can get cereal, juice and coffee at 5 A.M. He can ask an aide to make sure he is up on time. He can call in and explain if he wants to work overtime. Responsibility Is Goal He and about 100 others who have jobs are living in a shelter at the former Greenpoint Hospital, at 300 Skillman Avenue, at Kingsland Avenue, in the Greenpoint section. They are participating in a program intended to help them keep their jobs and, within 90 days, find housing on their own. ''The concept is to make them feel special and at the same time get them to take responsibility for their lives,'' said Sylvia Castaneda, who has been running the program since it began last October. To get into the program, the men must sign a contract agreeing among other things to put half their salaries into a savings account and attend workshops on personal hygiene, how to keep a job, how to look for an apartment and how to budget money. If the men lose their jobs or do not find a place to live by then, they must return to other shelters. Since the program started, 45 men have moved out, 19 to known addresses - what Ms. Castaneda considers a clear success. Of the 26 others, a few were sent to other shelters because they refused to follow the rules. But most lost their jobs. An Experiment, for Now ''They can come back,'' Ms. Castaneda said, ''as soon as they get it together.'' If the shelter proves effective, officials of the city's Human Resources Administration said, the program will be expanded and offered to homeless women and families. With its yellow-tiled walls and linoleum floors, the shelter is far from cozy, but life here is more pleasant than in most shelters, the men there say. The rooms are quite small, but, even without doors, they offer some privacy. And, because all the men must have daytime work to get in the program, there is little noise at night. Best of all, the men say, they feel far safer segregated from the homeless who do not have jobs - men, they say, who are more likely to steal or be mentally ill. ''If you want to get it together, you can do it here,'' said Mr. Bateza, who is 26 years old and has struggled with a drug problem for several years. Some of the men in the program have been in shelters for as long as two years, holding jobs off and on. Others have been homeless for just a few months. Most are in their 20's or 30's and work as messengers, security guards and drivers of delivery trucks, earning the mininum wage of $3.35 an hour, and trying to save enough money to put down a rent deposit and buy furniture. Working 35 hours a week at the minimum wage, they would be required to save about $55 a week. Lies to Keep Jobs In the meantime, most of the men say that they must lie about where they are living or risk loosing their jobs. For that reason, many did not want their names used. A few said they had turned to the shelter system, because the housing they could afford was usually in such bad repair and in such dangerous neighborhoods that the shelters were no worse. ''Some of these rooms, you might as well be in a shelter,'' said Antonio Rivera, who has already saved $1,200 over the last few months and intends to go to Puerto Rico soon to make a new start. ''People break into those rooms like crazy.'' Mr. Bateza said that in the large shelters he had been unable to force himself to save. ''You're living rent free,'' he said. ''You got no responsibility, you tend to just go out on pay day and spend.'' Some turned to the program because they hoped the additional supervision and care would help them help themselves. Since there are only about 100 men in the program, the staff knows almost everybody and can prod those who need it to keep appointments and follow the shelter's rules. Ms. Castaneda, a woman who is quick to laugh and just as quick to dress down a 200-pound man who has been rude, spends a good deal of time reminding the men to look for apartments or keep appointments. ''Sometimes,'' she says, ''these guys are like children. They want the attention.''"

The New York Times, 3D YOUTH HELD IN ATTACK FREED," Jon L. Lester, one of three defendants in the Howard Beach incident, was released from the Rikers Island jail yesterday after posting $25,000 bail. The other two defendants, Scott Kern, 17 years old, and Jason Ladone, 16, both of Howard Beach, Queens, were freed on bail Monday after murder and assault charges against the three youths were dismissed. They still face reckless endangerment charges. A spokesman for the City Department of Correction, James Whitford, said Mr. Lester, 17 of Ozone Park, left the jail about 3 P.M. Mr. Whitford could not say if the sum was paid in cash or by bond, which would have required an action by a judge. Mr. Lester's attorney, Bryan Fielder Levinson, said yesterday that neighbors had started a fund for his defense. ''I understand there are some people trying to help his mother out with legal fees and bail,'' he said. The lawyer said he did not know Mr. Lester's whereabouts. Mr. Levinson said he did not believe the beating of three blacks by a gang of white youths in Howard Beach Dec. 20 was a racial incident. ''This was a confrontation, but it was blown up that way,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''If you had a situation where blacks came into the neighborhood and someone said 'Let's attack the blacks,' that's a racial incident. But if two groups get into a confrontation, and they call each other names, that's just people. Some do it and some don't. But the cause is a confrontation.''"

The New York Times, NO LONGER QUESTION MARKS," The last big game Tim McKyer remembered was in 1984. His school, Texas-Arlington, played Lousiana Tech for the Southland Conference championship. ''We lost,'' he said, ''34-blank.'' Don Griffin's last big game was last year. His school, Middle Tennessee State, beat Akron for the Ohio Valley Conference championship. ''But I don't remember the score,'' he said. Such are the humble beginnings of the San Francisco 49ers' starting cornerbacks - rookies, roommates, each from a small school where he played safety, each about to play in the next biggest game of his life - a National Conference division playoff game Sunday in Giants Stadium against the Giants. Six months ago, McKyer and Griffin were little more than 6-foot, 176-pound question marks that Coach Bill Walsh and his staff thought might develop. McKyer was taken on the third round of the college draft, Griffin on the sixth. ''McKyer had good speed and quickness,'' said George Seifert, the 49ers' defensive coordinator. ''We liked him as a cover man. Griffin was one of those guys you figure, maybe he will, maybe he won't make the team, and where we drafted him, he probably shouldn't have.'' Both players developed to such a degree that McKyer started every game at left cornerback, Griffin all but one at right cornerback. Walsh called them ''the two best rookies at their positions'' in the National Football League. Aware of Inexperience Whether they are or they aren't is now of less importance than how they perform against the Giants, who were well aware of their limited experience five weeks ago in their 21-17 victory over the 49ers in Candlestick Park. Phil Simms had his best game of the season with 27 completions for 388 yards, but he is best remembered more for engineering three touchdown drives within 11 minutes of the third quarter, which began with the 49ers leading, 17-0. McKyer and Griffin remember only too well what Simms did. Stacy Robinson beat McKyer for a 34-yard touchdown pass that cut the lead to 17-14, and on the next series, he beat Griffin for a 49-yard completion at the 49ers' 1-yard line. One play later, the Giants led, 21-17. McKyer erred in judgment and allowed Robinson to get by him. Simms said after the game, ''I just caught the guy sleeping.'' And the other day at his news conference, Walsh noted that McKyer ''let up because he didn't think the ball was going to be thrown to his side.'' ''I felt like dirt,'' McKyer said today, recalling the touchdown pass. Griffin Less Distressed Griffin was less distressed over the play he was involved in. He had covered Robinson well; Robinson simply made a great catch. Anyway, it is not a cornerback's nature to dwell on the negative. He can't, and the good ones don't. In that respect, McKyer and Griffin are fortunate in that as roommates, they commiserate with each other, ''get each other going,'' as McKyer said. Moreover, they have history on their side: The 49ers won their first of two Super Bowls in 1981 with three rookie defensive backs - Ronnie Lott and Eric Wright at the corners and Carlton Williamson at strong safety. Dwight Hicks was the veteran of the group, a third-year player at free safety. This season, Lott, who led the league in interceptions with 10, has played at free safety. Wright has missed every game but one with a groin injury. Williamson has started every game at strong safety. Hicks never reported because of a contract dispute and was released. Later in the year, he signed with the Indianapolis Colts. Neither McKyer nor Griffin had any idea the season would turn out this way for them. McKyer came into training camp only trying to make the team, figuring ''I had a 50-50 chance.'' ''But they had a position open,'' he said. ''I thought, with hard work, who knows?'' ''I really didn't know about my future,'' said Griffin. ''I felt if I could do the job, do well, work hard, I could make the team. As for starting, I just didn't know.'' Amazed at Rookies Seifert is fairly amazed at how well they have played as rookies, handling new positions, the pressure of a division race and the added attention playoff teams seem to generate. ''You also have to consider their backgrounds,'' he said. ''Eric, Ronnie and Dwight were all from big schools. They were used to big games, big crowds. And our system then was just developing; it was much less complicated than it is now. These guys have come in here at 7:30 three mornings a week from day one to look at films. They're still doing it.'' They feel as if they have to. The 1986 team has matched the 1981 team only by winning the division. At the moment, the current group is three victories away from a league championship. ''We know all about the 1981 team,'' McKyer said. ''They did as a young team. It would be nice if we could, too.''  N.F.L. PLAYOFFS"
The New York Times, FINAL KICK WINS FOR VIRGINIA TECH," Chris Kinzer kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired today to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 victory over North Carolina State in the Peach Bowl and give Coach Bill Dooley a triumph in his final game at the school. Erik Chapman, the Hokies' quarterback, led the winning drive by completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards in the final 1 minute 53 seconds. The drive was helped by a 15-yard pass-interference penalty on the play immediately before Kinzer's field goal. Mike Cofer had kicked a 33-yard field goal with 7:12 left to give North Carolina State a 24-22 lead. The contest completed an 8-3-1 season for Dick Sheridan, the first-year North Carolina State coach, who took over a program that had suffered through three consecutive 3-8 seasons. Chapman Leads Comeback Chapman led the Hokies (9-2-1) back from a 21-10 halftime deficit as he connected on a 29-yard pass to Eddie Hunter to the 1-yard line following a fumble by Erik Kramer, the North Carolina State quarterback. Maurice Williams, who gained 129 yards on 16 attempts, dived over on the next play with 33 seconds left in the third period. The extra-point attempt failed, leaving the score 21-16. Virginia Tech made it 22-21 at 5:24 of the final quarter when Chapman connected with Steve Johnson on a 6-yard pass play following another fumble by Kramer. Both scoring passes by Kramer came following interceptions of Chapman. Derrick Taylor, who had one of the thefts for the Wolfpack, also blocked a punt in the opening quarter that was recovered in the end zone by Brian Bulluck for North Carolina's first score. Baylor 21, Colorado 9 HOUSTON (AP) - Baylor's defense shut down Colorado's wishbone attack and set up Derrick McAdoo for two 1-yard touchdown dives to lead the Bears to victory in the 28th Bluebonnet Bowl. Ray Berry, voted Baylor's most valuable player in the game, and Keith Rose, a tackle, recovered Buffalo fumbles to set up McAdoo's touchdown runs as Baylor ended a string of three straight losses in the bowl by Southwest Conference teams. Colorado, 6-6 for the season, lost three of six fumbles and had one pass intercepted. Berry's recovery at the Colorado 20 on the second play of the third quarter raised the Bears' lead to 21-3. Colorado got its touchdown with 2:38 to go in the third period on a 31-yard run by Mark Hatcher, the quarterback. The touchdown narrowed Baylor's lead to 21-9, but Berry tackled Cameron Jones on a 2-point conversion attempt. The versatile Baylor offense took advantage of a fine defensive effort for a 14-3 halftime lead on McAdoo's first score and Cody Carlson's 2-yard pass to Darnell Chase. Carlson completed his first eight passes to eight Baylor receivers. When he went to Chase for the second time, it was a 2-yard touchdown in the corner of the end zone. Colorado's only first-half score came on a 36-yard field goal by Dave DeLine, who then missed a 41-yard attempt with 9 seconds to go in the half. Baylor ended its season with a 9-3 record and its second straight bowl victory. The Bears defeated Louisiana State, 21-7, in the 1985 Liberty Bowl. Iowa 39, San Diego State 38 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Rob Houghtlin's 41-yard field goal as time expired Tuesday night gave Iowa (9-3) the victory in the Holiday Bowl. San Diego State's Kevin Rahill had kicked a 21-yard field goal with 47 seconds left for a 38-36 lead. Kevin Harmon ran the kickoff back 48 yards to the Aztecs' 37. Two running plays sandwiched round an incomplete pass moved the ball to the 24 with 4 seconds left. Houghtlin then kicked the winning field goal, capping a fourth quarter in which the lead changed hands three times in the last 4:26. San Diego State (8-4) led by 21-13 at the half and by 28-21 after three quarters. Then it took a 35-21 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter when Chris Hardy ran 6 yards for a touchdown. The Aztecs were playing without two starters. Clarence Nunn, the defensive back, and Anthony Conyers, the wide receiver, both tested positive for banned substances under the N.C.A.A.'s drug-testing program for bowl participants.

The New York Times, RESULTS PLUS," College Basketball Notre Dame 63, Maryland 50: Scott Hicks scored 14 points, and David Rivers and Donald Royal added 13 each, as Notre Dame held off a brief Maryland rally last night in College Park, Md. The victory was the sixth in a row for Notre Dame after two losses to start the season. Maryland suffered its first loss in three games. Notre Dame held a 42-31 edge in rebounds as Maryland played the final 26 minutes without its center, Derrick Lewis, the leading rebounder and scorer for the Terps, who sprained an ankle late in the first half. After leading by 28-19 at halftime, the Irish stretched their advantage to 46-31 with 7:43 remaining before John Johnson sparked a Maryland rally. Johnson sank two shots from 3-point range and Greg Nared added another to pull the Terps within 7 point, at 52-45, before Notre Dame ran off 9 consecutive points.

The New York Times, LAWYERS FOR QUEENS ASSAULT VICTIMS EXPLAIN REFUSAL TO AID INVESTIGATIONS," The lawyers for two of the black men who were beaten in the Howard Beach racial incident asserted yesterday that their clients had refused to cooperate with the Queens District Attorney because prosecutors were ''making a case'' for the white defendants. Inside Our Lady of Charity Roman Catholic Church, at 1669 Dean Street in the Crown Heights section, the lawyers spoke for more than an hour before eight television cameras and scores of reporters and supporters who frequently applauded the lawyers. The lawyers - Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason - made separate statements. They answered seven questions before leaving the church and declining further interviews. Neither of their clients, Cedric Sandiford and Timothy Grimes, was at the church. The church was the site of the funeral for the third victim of the attack, Michael Griffith, who was struck and killed by a car on Shore Parkway after he fled from a group of white youths, according to the police. Mr. Griffith's mother, Jean, attended the lawyers' session with reporters yesterday, as did her sons Christopher and Anthony. These are the principal assertions made yesterday by Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason and reponses from the authorities: The Inquiry The lawyers said that Mr. Sandiford had cooperated fully with prosecutors and detectives for three days, and that he had refused to do so only after prosecutors demanded that he view a lineup of potential suspects. Mr. Sandiford, the lawyers said, had told prosecutors he was unable to do so because he was suffering from serious eye injuries that impaired his vision. ''Nobody would ask a blind man to view a lineup unless he was conducting a bad-faith investigation,'' Mr. Maddox said. A spokesman for Mr. Santucci, Thomas McCarthy, said the District Attorney was aware of Mr. Sandiford's vision problems. Two days after the attack, Mr. McCarthy said, Mr. Sandiford told prosecutors that his eyesight had improved and that he then had agreed to attend a lineup. Later that same day, according to Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Maddox told prosecutors that he was representing Mr. Sandiford and that his client was unable to view the lineup. '' We would never demand he view a lineup when he was indicating difficulties with his vision,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''Since Mr. Maddox entered the case we have not heard directly from Mr. Sandiford.'' The lawyers also contended that the District Attorney's office had failed to obtain statements on videotape from the three teen-agers who detectives said admitted participating in the assaults. Mr. McCarthy said videotaped statements are normally obtained after a suspect is identified in a lineup. ''Because Mr. Sandiford did not participate in a lineup we never got to the videotaping stage,'' he said. The Assault The lawyers said that after Mr. Sandiford was beaten by white youths, he was mistreated by white police officers and detectives who strip searched him, mistreated him and threatened to file criminal charges against him. Alice T. McGillion, the deputy police commissioner for public information, said Mr. Sandiford was ''absolutely not'' strip searched. She said he was routinely ''frisked'' for weapons, but that he was not treated like a criminal. ''He was definitely treated like a victim,'' Ms. McGillion said. According to Ms. McGillion, both black and white detectives were assigned to the investigation. She said yesterday that personnel files were not immediately available for a breakdown on the number of white and black investigators assigned to the case. The lawyers said Mr. Sandiford told police officers and detectives that a car that had chased the three black men in the streets drove onto to the highway and struck and killed Mr. Griffith. Ms. McGillion said that Mr. Sandiford at first told the police that he had not seen the car strike Mr. Griffith. According to Ms. McGillion, Mr. Sandiford said he believed he had heard the impact of the accident. Mr. Sandiford also said, according to Ms. McGillion, that after Mr. Griffith had been run over, Mr. Sandiford saw on the highway a dark-colored car that had earlier chased the victims, Ms. McGillion said. Mr. McCarthy said Mr. Sandiford never told the police or prosecutors that he had seen the car strike Mr. Griffith. The lawyers said that the car that struck Mr. Griffith, driven by Dominick Blum, a 24-year-old city court officer, resembled the car that chased the three men on the streets of Howard Beach. The lawyers said Mr. Blum's car was not impounded, no photographs were taken of it and that Mr. Blum was not arrested for leaving the scene of an accident. Ms. McGillion said detectives have evidence that Mr. Blum was not involved in the street attack on the victims. She said Mr. Blum's car was not impounded because all of the forensic evidence, including paint scrapings and photographs, was taken. Other police officials have said Mr. Blum was not arrested because he returned an hour after the accident to the scene. Under normal police policy, drivers who return to the scene and volunteer statements are not arrested, officials said. Mr. Blum, according to the police, said he at first believed his car had struck an animal or tire on the road. According to authorities, Mr. Blum could be indicted later by a grand jury or charged by the police for leaving the scene. The Evidence The lawyers said no photographs of Mr. Sandiford's head and eye injuries were taken after the assault for possible use later as evidence. Ms. McGillion said such photos were taken on the night of the incident. The lawyers said that on the afternoon after the death, Mr. Grimes was picked up and kept in a room for two hours by detectives at the 106th Precinct station house in Queens. But, the lawyers said he was not questioned that day or afterward about the assault. Ms. McGillion said Mr. Grimes was questioned by the police but said he declined to give investigators an address of a woman that he and the two other victims had been visiting in St. Albans, Queens, before their car broke down. Christopher Griffith, the brother of Michael Griffith, said at the church meeting yesterday that on the afternoon after the death of Michael, detectives from the 106th Precinct picked up Mr. Sandiford at their home in the East New York section of Brooklyn for questioning. Mr. Sandiford is the stepfather of the Griffith brothers. Mr. Griffith said the detectives did not take notes of what Mr. Sandiford said and listened to a New York Giants-Green Bay Packers football game on the radio as they questioned him. The lawyers cited the questioning as an example of how Mr. Sandiford was mistreated and that the police from the start of the investigation discounted his version of events. Ms. McGillion said she had no information that Mr. Griffith was with Mr. Sandiford while he was being questioned. She also said that she could not verify yesterday whether or not detectives took notes or listened to a football game while questioning Mr. Sandiford. The Hearing Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason said that at the court hearing on Monday when murder charges against the three teen-agers were dismissed, the District Attorney's office did not enter hospital or medical records attesting to Mr. Sandiford's injuries. Mr. McCarthy said that prosecutors did not have the hospital records, and that Mr. Maddox had ''told us you are not going to use that as an excuse of a continuance.'' According to Mr. McCarthy, medical records would not have been relevant for obtaining a postponement of the hearing. Under New York State law, the defendants were entitled to a hearing on the charges against them on Monday because no indictment had been handed down against them by a grand jury. The lawyers, in their statements, said that Mr. Santucci's office had sufficent evidence and witnesses to obtain indictments without Mr. Sandiford's testimony. ''They are making him the hub of the case when he isn't,'' Mr. Mason said. Mr. Sandiford has declined to testify before a grand jury and Mr. Santucci has described his testimony as ''vital.'' Mr. Mason said yesterday that neither he nor Mr. Maddox were receiving fees for representing the two survivors and the Griffith family. Mr. Mason said the lawyers had no plans to file negligence suits against the city because of the racial attacks. Mr. Maddox's eyes watered and a tear was visible on his left cheek when he recounted having seen Mr. Ward in a television news report on Tuesday suggest that his motive for representing Mr. Sandiford was a fee in a civil suit. ''What Ben Ward said, hurt me more than anything else,'' Mr. Maddox added. Mr. Griffith's mother declined to answer any questions. Family members and lawyers also refused to provide information about Michael Griffith's background except to say he had been born in Grenada. Christopher Griffith said his family had declined an invitation from Mayor Koch to have breakfast at City Hall on Christmas Day in an effort to reduce racial tension. ''The dinner or breakfast I would like him to serve me is justice,'' Mr. Griffith said. At the meeting, the legal strategy and conduct of Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason was endorsed by Assemblyman Albert Vann, a Democrat of Brooklyn, The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, executive pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Manhattan, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., executive director of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, Jitu Weusi, a community activist, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, a community activist. In a prayer before the lawyers spoke, Mr. Chavis, said Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason had been ''scorned and ridiculed because they dared to represent the black families and victims of racial injustice.''"

The New York Times, STATE'S LEADERS ARE SWORN IN ON EVE OF '87," Governor Cuomo, with a possible Presidential campaign waiting in the wings, took the oath of office New Year's Eve for a second term as New York's chief executive. The official oath was administered to Mr. Cuomo by Sol Wachtler, Chief Judge of New York State, during a private ceremony tonight at the Governor's Mansion. ''What we have to do now is spend four more years trying to provide other people in this state with the kind of magnificent opportunities that we've had,'' Mr. Cuomo told a small group of friends and relatives after taking his oath. ''We worked very hard the last four years, we'll work even harder in the four years ahead.'' Before taking his oath of office, Mr. Cuomo, a licensed notary public, swore in his new lieutenant governor, Stan Lundine. While the two Democrats took their official oaths of office on New Year's Eve to meet requirements of the state constitution, a public inauguration ceremony was to be held on New Year's Day at the Empire State Plaza adjacent to the State Capitol. State workers were busy today putting up the last of the red, white and blue bunting for the event. Mr. Cuomo spent some time in the Convention Center hall practicing his speech. Mr. Cuomo said a few days after his re-election that he was going to begin thinking about running for President. He has yet to announce any decision. Nonetheless, just before the ceremony tonight, aides to the Governor said that he would be traveling to five other states, including Iowa, in the next several months. Iowa is the site of the nation's first Presidential party caucuses. Cuomo also plans to travel to California, Florida, Louisiana and North Carolina, said a spokesman, Martin Steadman."
The New York Times, GUNFIRE HITS JET NEAR NORTH CAROLINA AIRPORT," A United Airlines jet coming in for a landing at Raleigh-Durham Airport was shot at today. The plane, carrying 16 passengers, landed safely, but a New York City man aboard was injured in the shooting. The New Yorker, Barry Rollins, 30 years old, was hurt by a bullet that pierced the belly of the aircraft, passed through his thigh and lodged in his cheek. Mr. Rollins was admitted to Rex Hospital in Raleigh, where he was reported in stable condition. Flight 1502, which had taken off from Wilmington, N.C., was 300 feet in the air, south of the airport and about 20 seconds short of touchdown when Mr. Rollins was wounded. Pvt. Jeff C. Dillard, a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., one of the passengers on the Boeing 737 jet, said in an interview at the airport: ''Somebody shot the plane. It was from outside.'' A United Airlines spokesman, Kay Lund, said in a telephone interview from Chicago: ''It was one or two miles out when some object, believed to be a bullet, pierced the underside of the aircraft.'' The aircraft's landing was not affected by the shooting, Ms. Lund said. ''The pilot wasn't even aware of the incident until he landed.'' Mr. Rollins, wearing black basketball sneakers and a New York Mets jacket, was seated in Seat 16F at a window on the right side of the cabin, behind the wing. Private Dillard, who was seated two rows behind Mr. Rollins, said he heard a popping sound from the bullet, which left a hole 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter in the side of the plane. He said the bullet passed through Mr. Rollins's right thigh and lodged in his left cheek. ''I was helping hold a compress on his face,'' Private Dillard said. ''I think he was pretty much in shock as anyone would be.'' A passenger, George W. Chambers, who was returning home to New York, said a flight attendant asked Mr. Rollins what was wrong. Mr. Rollins replied, ''I don't know,'' Mr. Chambers said. Passengers who had planned to remain on Flight 1502 to its next stop, Dulles Airport near Washington, were put aboard another aircraft. The pierced jet was impounded on the runway and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called to the airport. ''We are going over the plane for any evidence,'' said Donald P. Paschall, chief of police at Raleigh-Durham Airport. 'Penetration in the Fuselage' ''We found penetration in the fuselage shortly behind the wing, and it did go through to where the passenger was sitting,'' Mr. Paschall said. ''We don't know if this was intentional or accidental.'' ''We are looking south of the airport for anything out of the ordinary,'' Mr. Paschall said. Wake County sheriff's deputies and North Carolina Highway Patrol troopers searched roads and wooded areas south of the airport tonight. John C. Brantley 3d, the airport director, said a similar incident had happened in the area about three years ago when some youngsters fired shotgun pellets into an approaching small airplane. The hole in the exterior of the United jet today was about five feet below the windows behind the wing. A Rex Hospital spokesman said at 8 P.M. that Mr. Rollins had been X-rayed and would undergo surgery ''to clean up his cheek.'' The shooting occurred about 5:25 P.M. Mr. Rollins was conscious when emergency medical technicians removed him from the plane, Mr. Paschall said. At 7:30 P.M. a Rex spokesman said Mr. Rollins was alert and had spoken by telephone with his mother. Sgt. C. M. Cummings of the North Carolina Highway Patrol said, ''It was definitely a bullet.'' Mr. Paschall, when asked if the shot might have been fired by a hunter, said, ''It's a possibility.''"

The New York Times, 23 BLACK LEADERS AND KOCH ATTACK 'PERVASIVE' RACISM," Mayor Koch and 23 black leaders agreed at City Hall yesterday to work together to attack what they called ''pervasive and systemic'' racism in the city. Several participants called the meeting helpful, with Councilwoman Mary Pinkett of Brooklyn saying that it could help ''defuse'' things in the short run. Arthur Barnes, the president of the New York Urban Coalition, said that the meeting dealt with ''complex'' issues of race relations and that the participants felt that they had ''by persuasion and the weight of our logic'' convinced the Mayor that improvements were needed. Growing Tension Their remarks came in response to growing tension in New York City over a racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens, on Dec. 20. One of the victims, Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old black man, was struck by a car and died. On Monday, murder charges against three whites accused in the attack were dropped for insufficient evidence after another black victim of the attack refused to testify. The black leaders said yesterday that it was not their intent to take sides in the emerging debate over the investigation or the role that witnesses and lawyers have taken. Earlier yesterday, in an emotional meeting with reporters at a Brooklyn church, lawyers for the two surviving black victims criticized not only some of the blacks who were to meet with Mr. Koch but also the police and prosecutors who have been investigating the case. One of those at the church meeting, the Rev. Al Sharpton, derisively called the City Hall meeting ''a coon show.'' 'A New Lynch Mob' ''What we have in this situation is this,'' said one of the lawyers, Alton H. Maddox Jr. ''The Mayor, the Police Department, the Queens District Attorney's Office, the Police Commissioner and some of our Negro leadership have all formed a new lynch mob. And they are hounding and chasing the messengers for speaking the truth. We have a lynch mob that is running loose in New York City.'' Mr. Maddox and another lawyer for the black victims, C. Vernon Mason, also said that their clients had stopped cooperating with the Queens District Attorney's office because prosecutors ''were making a case'' for the white defendants. Point by point, Mr. Maddox and Mr. Mason sought to show how the police and prosecutors had mishandled the case and had unfairly subjected them to criticism that they had hampered the investigation. At one point, Mr. Maddox's voice quavered and his eyes began tearing as he said he was hurt and insulted by Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward's suggestion on Tuesday that the lawyer was involved in the case for the money he could make from any civil suit growing out of the incident. ''How could Ward be used by that man that way,'' Mr. Maddox said, referring to Mayor Koch. ''I have not received a dime from the Griffith family or any soul breathing air on this earth. I have not been promised a dime from the Griffith family or from any soul breathing air on this earth. I have no expectations of receiving a dime from the Griffith family or any soul breathing air on this earth.'' 'An Even Greater Degree' At a news conference after the hour-and-a-half meeting in City Hall, the Mayor said that he had asked for and heard the participants' recommendations for eliminating racial discrimination in the city. The Mayor conceded that it may be more difficult to eliminate the racism ''in the hearts of people.'' But he vowed that his administration would work to see that the law was vigorously applied in cases of racial bias and racial violence. ''Those who violate the law should be brought to justice very quickly and, when tried and convicted, be sentenced to an even greater degree than they would if the case did not include that bias aspect.'' The Mayor's comments came in the wake of a meeting that at first appeared to what some of the black leaders had thought to be an attempt to reinforce his call Tuesday to the lawyers for one of the victims, Cedric Sandiford, to end their refusal to allow their client to be interviewed by the prosecutors. Although spokesmen for the Mayor insisted that was not its purpose, the suggestion was much on the minds of those who attended. Comment From Rangel Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, said that he was pleased that the Mayor had not tried to convince those in attendance that they should, as a group,''second-guess the judge, prosecutor witness or attorneys'' in the case. The Rev. Floyd H. Flake, who will soon take his seat as the new Congressman from the Queens district in which the Dec. 20 attack took place, added: ''It is appropriate that the Mayor has not tried to beat us in line on this issue, or to tell us what he wants us to do or say to the people. But to ask our concerns about what we do to eliminate racism.'' When asked whether the Mayor's concern was uncharacteristic, Mr. Rangel, in the past a frequent critic of the Mayor on a host of issues, including what he has termed Mr. Koch's lack of sensitivity to black concerns, was conciliatory and praised the leadership that the Mayor had shown so far in condemning the Howard Beach attack. But he added: ''When one responds in a manner that you would want them to, it serves no purpose to attribute any ill motivation to it. There is absolutely no question in my mind that the Mayor has been an outspoken critic of those who take the law in their own hands.'' Before and after the session, others reacted to the criticism of the session. Harriet Michel, the president of the New York Urban League, when asked about the criticism, said she was ''absolutely not'' attending the meeting to join in criticism of Mr. Sandiford and his lawyer, Mr. Maddox. 'Made Sure It Was Not' Roscoe Brown Jr., the president of Bronx Community College, said that the idea of joining the criticism of the victims' lawyers was never raised and ''we made sure it was not.'' Arthur Barnes, the president of the New York Urban Coalition, said that ''there was no lynch-mob atmosphere, but a positive and exemplary one.'' Prior to the meeting, Mr. Flake had said that all of those scheduled to attend had ''reputations and constituencies'' and could not afford to simply join the Mayor in criticizing the attorneys. ''I'm not part of a lynch mob or a coon show,'' said Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten of Brooklyn. ''I would not try to pressure the lawyers. When the Mayor says he wants to discuss black issues, I have to go.'' 'Great Deal of Respect' Although most of the participants said that the issue of joining the call for Mr. Maddox and his client to cooperate with the Queens District Attorney never arose, the Rev. Leo Hamilton of the Bethany Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens, said that some did suggest to the Mayor that his evaluation of the case had caused problems. ''I have a great deal of respect for the Mayor, but he established a basis for evaluating this situation which almost seemed to throw the onus back on to blacks,'' he said of the Mayor's criticism of Mr. Maddox. ''We told him that we thought that should not have been the impression he left.'' Another participant in the meeting, who did not want to be identified, said that some had also criticized Police Commissioner Ward's suggestion at a news conference Tuesday with the Mayor that Mr. Maddox was motivated by the money that might result in a successful civil suit in connection with the racial attack. He said the comment was ''uncalled for.'' Among the things that the participants talked about, the Mayor said, was the need to do more in the city's education system and the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in housing, employment and other areas to ''improve the racial climate'' in the city. Housing Problems The Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins, said that many of the issues had come up in the past in other sessions in which blacks have criticized some city policies. ''These things tend to foster a climate that permits a Howard Beach to happen,'' said Mr. Dinkins, referring to problems of poor housing, poverty and the problems that he said plagued blacks in the city more than others. The Mayor termed the group an ad hoc one that was just the first of a number of such groups he would be meeting with to devise ways of easing racial tensions in the city and improving its racial climate. Perhaps the only specific initiatives he presented to the group were some details in a briefing by Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones and the Board of Education president, Robert F. Wagner Jr., of a new curriculum on race relations and tolerance that is to be instituted within a few weeks in city schools. 'More Positive' Mr. Rangel said after the meeting that he personally saw a contrast in the way the Mayor had responded to the Howard Beach incident and his response to other issues in the past that bared racial tensions in the city. ''It is more positive,'' Mr. Rangel said, adding that he hoped that response indicated ''some continuity by the Mayor in creating an atmosphere to avoid these incidents in the future.'' The Mayor said that his feelings and attitudes toward prejudice remained the same, but allowed that he had expressed them differently and more intensely this time after the Howard Beach incident. He attributed that to his own experiences as a lawyer aiding civil-rights workers in the South during the 1960's, in which he himself was followed and chased by a group of whites opposed to the rights demonstrations. A 'Wrenching Experience' He said that the accounts of the fate of the person killed in the Howard Beach incident recalled for him his own feelings of terror then. ''This case caused me an enormous wrenching experience and I could feel the terror,'' the Mayor said. ''It was palpable and that's what caused me to single this out.'' None of the participants in the meeting responded to the use of the term ''coon'' by Mr. Sharpton. Mayor Koch noted, however, that Mr. Sharpton had sought an invitation to the session and had been refused. It was only after he had asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson to intercede for him with the Mayor that he was invited. ''Then he did what he did,'' the Mayor said, referring to Mr. Sharpton's failure to show up. These were the participants at the meeting with Mayor Koch:  Betty Adams.  Arthur Barnes, president of the New York Urban Coalition.

The New York Times, COURT THROWS OUT CONTEMPT RULING AGAINST PAPER," The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit today threw out contempt convictions against the Providence Journal Company and its executive editor, Charles McC. Hauser, for printing an article two years ago about the late Raymond L. S. Patriarca, a reputed major organized crime figure. The article was based on tapes of conversations involving Mr. Patriarca. The action overturned a verdict by Federal District Judge Francis J. Boyle, who sentenced Mr. Hauser to an 18-month suspended jail term and fined the newspaper $100,000 on conviction for criminal contempt. Judge Boyle's ruling stemmed from an article published Nov. 14, 1985 by The Journal about Mr. Patriarca that included information from Federal Bureau of Investigation logs and memoranda obtained by The Journal and others under the Freedom of Information Act. The court had banned publication of any article. Ruling 'Transparently Invalid' ''We conclude that the district court's order of Nov. 13, 1985, was transparently invalid,'' wrote Judge John Minor Wisdom, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judge who was specially assigned to the case. ''The order constituted a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint on pure speech by the press. The burden to sustain such an order is tremendously heavy, and was not met in this case. ''The only potential danger posed by the restrained speech was to an individual's privacy right. That right can be adequately protected by a subsequent damages action.'' The move to prevent publication was filed by attorneys for Mr. Patriarca's son, Raymond J. Patriarca. No Comment on Decision A lawyer for Mr. Patriarca, William A. Curran, said, ''I haven't seen the decision, so I don't have anything to say about it.'' Mr. Partriarca could not be reached for comment. Mr. Hauser is vice president of the company, which publishes The Journal, a morning and Sunday newspaper; The Bulletin, an afternoon paper, and The Journal-Bulletin, a Saturday paper. He issued a statement saying in part, ''We believed from the beginning that our publication of material from the so-called Patriarca tapes was protected under the First Amendment. ''The circuit court ruling sends a clear massage to lower courts that prior restraints on publication will not be tolerated.'' Statement by Publisher ''We're pleased that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has upheld us,'' said Michael P. Metcalf, chairman and chief executive officer of The Providence Journal Company and publisher of The Providence Journal-Bulletin. ''The Circuit Court ruling strongly reaffirms similar findings on prior restraint issues. While The Journal-Bulletin felt it had no alternative but to publish in violation of the court's prohibition, our decision to do so was a most wrenching one. And while our action was drastic, it was taken with nothing but the highest respect for the court.'' Judge Wisdom heard the case with Levin Campbell, chief judge of the 1st Circuit, and Frank Coffin, a circuit judge. In his opinion, Judge Wisdom said the case involved a conflict between the First Amendment principle against prior restraint on freedom of the press and the need for orderly government and obedience to court orders."
The New York Times, POLICE OFFICERS LOSE BIAS AWARD," A Federal judge has overturned a $4.3 million discrimination award to 13 white Chicago police officers who charged they had been transferred from prestigious jobs because of their race and politics. The officers contended in a lawsuit that they had been transferred because they were white and supported Mayor Jane M. Byrne in the 1983 election in which she was defeated by Harold Washington. In early September a jury awarded each of the officers $55,000 in compensatory damages and $275,000 in punitive damages, more than the $250,000 sought in the lawsuit. In his ruling Tuesday, Judge Milton I. Shadur said the trial had produced no evidence of political discrimination, although he noted that a reasonable juror might have concluded there was some evidence of racial discrimination. Judge Shadur reversed a jury's finding that the 13 were entitled to punitive damages. He also said three of the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensatory damages. The judge also ruled that Raleigh Mathis, former executive director of the Office of Municipal Investigations, who along with the city was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, was not personally liable for any damages. Judge Shadur reversed the jury's finding of racial discrimination against three of the officers and requested additional information from eight plaintiffs. He gave two officers the option of accepting $15,000 each in compensatory damages or requesting a new trial to determine damages."
The New York Times, NEW MEXICO INDIANS PICK FIRST WOMAN GOVERNOR," The Pueblo of Isleta has elected its first woman as governor after the tribal council first decided to cancel the election, saying the village's constitution denied women the right to hold office. The governor, Verna Williamson, urged all residents to work together despite an ousted official's charge that candidates used ''strong-arm tactics'' to force the election. Ms. Williamson became the first woman elected as an official in this pueblo of about 3,000 people, situated 20 miles south of Albuquerque. She received 277 votes Tuesday while the other candidates, Juan B. Abeita and Alvino Lucero, who had been governor, got 208 and 109 votes. Under the pueblo's constitution, Mr. Abeita now becomes president of the tribal council and Mr. Lucero will be the council's vice president. Ms. Williamson said her first official act would be to name four council members, at least one of whom will be a woman. Most Vocal Opponent The former council president, Ernest Jaramillo, was the most vocal opponent to Ms. Williamson's candidacy. He said he and others would meet with lawyers to determine if the election was legal. Mr. Jaramillo said the election began when three candidates forced their way into the election room, opened the ballot box and forced the tribal secretary to begin accepting ballots. ''It's like a mob mob rule with the law on their side,'' Mr. Jaramillo said. ''They used the police officer to manhandle my councilmen.'' Ms. Williamson, 36 years old, who runs a counseling program on substance abuse, received enough votes in the tribal primary election Dec. 6 and 7 to become one of three finalists for office. But the council voted Dec. 16 to void the primary. Lorenzo R. Jojola, a judge of the tribal court, then ruled that the election should proceed. Mr. Jaramillo said the council, acting in its role as an appellate court, voted to stay the judge's order. Ms. Williamson called the election ''a truly great victory,'' adding, ''They have spoken loud and clear that they want a more open and representative government. We intend to give them that.'' ''Now's the time for all our people to come together,'' she continued. ''We have been through a tumultuous election, but for the first time since this present form of government was established we have had an open election.'' Ms. Williamson said, ''I want to see open council meetings and I want to see the people involved in the decision-making process.'' She said she wanted the pueblo to take a closer look at social issues. ''The women think more about social issues and the men have always thought more about economic issues,'' she said. ''We need to have a better balance of concerns than we have now.''"
The New York Times, SANDSTROM'S 3 STOP ISLANDERS," One team emerged energized, the other demoralized, and both spoke of the need to construct some winning streaks. ''No matter how you slice it, to win on successive nights and in successive games is what it takes to build a consistent team,'' said John Vanbiesbrouck, the Ranger goalie, who last night credited his teammates with taking ''the big shots.'' The Rangers charged into the overtime session at Madison Square Garden, hitting posts and sending the Islander squad into a frenzy of disarray, but somehow the Islanders fended them off. Then, with 53 seconds left, Bryan Trottier received a slashing penalty and Tomas Sandstrom completed his hat trick for a 4-3 victory with 23 seconds remaining. It was the first hat trick as a Ranger for Sandstrom, whose ferocity at close quarters in front of the Islander net twice earned him game-tying goals and finally brought about the game-winner. ''It surprised me when they called the penalty at that time,'' he said, ''because they hadn't called much all night long. But I felt like every guy on our team was going for the win when we went out in overtime. If we didn't win this, they'd be ahead by 9 points, maybe too far to catch.'' In the overtime, the Rangers overwhelmed Kelly Hrudey, the Islander goalie, by taking six shots to none for his team. Wave After Wave ''What I saw was wave after wave,'' said Hrudey, who underwent similar straits to salvage a 3-3 tie at Pittsburgh on Saturday. ''Besides starting a new year, we really need to string some wins together.'' Lately, the Rangers, who beat the Penguins Tuesday night, been dominant in their division while the Islanders, now without a victory in their last four outings, had been unconvincing against all comers. Historically speaking, the Islanders have been notably unconvincing at the Garden, where their record, after last night, was 2-9-2 in their last 13 visits. ''The call against me was too obvious for me to even comment on,'' said Trottier, who did not appear to touch Tony McKegney with his stick. ''But we have to give them the edge in overtime. They created some good chances while we had none.'' Last night, as appears to be their wont in a series knotted 1-1-1 after three previous meetings, the two clubs jostled their way to a 3-3 tie in regulation time amidst more than the normal amount of hilarity, vulgarity and noisemaking. Sandstom scored his second goal of the evening and gained the tie at 5:32 of the final period when he arrived alone at the left post, collected a pass from Jan Erixon and made his move on Hrudey, who watched the puck whisk between his legs the moment he raised his stick to try and poke it away from Sandstrom. The Rangers, persistantly but often inartiscally on the attack, outshot their guests, 31-21, after three periods. Esposito Fills In Again The Rangers skated strongly, again under the vivid direction of General Manager Phil Esposito. Esposito will remain coach until Tom Webster, who is still recovering from ear surgery, returns on Monday. Esposito had to be pleased with the pace his players performed at, but their markmanship, especially on the power play, was less than forbidding in the first and second periods. But so, for that matter, was the offensive posturing of the Islanders, at least until a power-play opportunity came their way at the close of the first period. The Rangers went ahead, 1-0, at 12:50 when a defenseman, Curt Giles, sent a slap shot from the point bouncing past Hrudey, the Islanders' goaltender of choice in divisional matches (9-2-1 going into this game). Hrudey was partially screened by Tomas Jonsson as he moved Mike Ridley out of the crease area. Islanders Lethargic Once they had their goal, the Rangers concentrated on slowing down the Islander attackers, not such a monumental task, considering the lethargy of the attack in the early going. There was a preponderance of mild-mannered tugging and groping, and until Mike Ridley was caught on a high-sticking minor at 17:45, it seemed to work. But with four seconds remaining in the penalty, Patrick Flatley took Mike Bossy's pass and chipped a wrist shot by Vanbiesbrouck, who was returning to the nets after a two-game layoff that featured Bob Froese, and the game was tied 1-1 at 19:42. Alan Kerr got his second goal of the season for the Islanders at 10:58 of the second period when he blasted a low shot from the right circle past Vanbiesbrouck, providing the Islanders with a brief edge. But Sandstrom, who corraled Don Maloney's pass at the inside edge of the right circle and lauched it midair, gained a 2-2 tie at 14:30. The Islanders damaged the Rangers late in the period again, and took a 3-2 advantage when Rich Kromm snapped a high shot over Vanbiesbrouck's glove at 19:22."
The New York Times, EX-DEFENDANTS IN CHILD ABUSE CASE TO APPEAL RULING ON SUIT," Lawyers for three former preschool teachers said today that they would appeal a judge's ruling that tossed out part of a large civil suit alleging false arrest on charges of child abuse. He said the women had filed their suit too late. The three former teachers, Virginia McMartin, the 79-year-old founder of the McMartin Preschool institution in nearby Manhattan Beach; her granddaughter, Peggy Ann Buckey, 30, and Babette Spitler, 38, filed civil suits this year, each seeking $10 million in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount in punitive damages stemming from their arrest, imprisonment and a long preliminary hearing. The three women filed their claims in Los Angeles Superior Court after all criminal charges against them and two other McMartin teachers were dropped last January. At the time, Ira Reiner, the Los Angeles County District Attorney, said the evidence against the five was ''incredibly weak.'' In all, seven McMartin teachers and administrators were arrested when the case began in 1984. There are now two remaining defendants, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 60, and her son Raymond, 28, who are awaiting trial. A hearing to determine if Mr. Reiner's office engaged in discriminatory prosecution in failing to dismiss the charges against Peggy McMartin Buckey and Raymond Buckey will resume Monday. Ruling on Deadline In dismissing the part of the civil suit that deals with false arrest, invasion of privacy and slander, Judge Warren Deering of Superior Court said the women should have filed their claims within 100 days of their arrest in March, 1984. He said that if the plaintiffs' assertions were that they were innocent at the time of the arrest, then they ''should have filed their claims within 100 days of that.'' James Davis, who represents Virginia McMartin and Peggy Ann Buckey, said today that to his knowledge the 100-day deadline ''had never been applied this way before.'' In an interview, Mr. Davis said it would have been a ''totally useless act'' to file within 100 days of their arrest in March, 1984, in part because criminal charges always take precedence over civil actions, which normally begin after criminal cases are over. 'A Bizarre Result' Mr. Davis argued that the 100-day deadline should run not from the time of arrest but from the date when Mr. Reiner dropped charges against the plaintiffs in January. He said the judge ''should have interpreted the statute as originally written,'' adding that he would ask Judge Deering to reconsider his ruling. ''It is a bizarre result,'' he added.  Mr. Davis and Eliseo D. W. Gauna, who represents Mrs. Spitler, said that the heart of their suit, that state officials, specifically the District Attorney's office, engaged in civil rights violations, was still intact. The civil rights section of the law does not have a 100-day time requirement, Mr. Davis said. The women say their prosecution and their long preliminary hearing were based on unreliable testimony of preschool children interviewed by therapists unschooled in criminal investigation. Under state law, district attorneys and their assistants generally have broad powers of immunity against civil suits and damages arising from their actions. County attorneys, representing the District Attorney's office, have raised the immunity argument in seeking to dismiss the action. But Mr. Davis argues that prosecutors do not have immunity for improper investigation. Officials Dispute Charges County attorneys representing the District Attorney's office also say that there was nothing improper in the nature of the McMartin investigation. Mr. Davis says the initial inquiry, which came amid a heated election campaign between Mr. Reiner and Robert Philobosian, the then District Attorney, led Mr. Philobosian to use the McMartin case to gain publicity. Mr. Philobosian lost the race. Mr. Philobosian, who was named as a defendant in the civil suit, has denied the charges."
The New York Times, HOTEL FIRES: MAJOR DISASTERS," The blaze in San Juan, P.R., yesterday was among the most devastating hotel fires in history.

The New York Times," AS LAVA FLOWS IN HAWAII, EXPLANATIONS ABOUND"," David Lanakila figures the problem of the flowing lava was created by the Hawaiian fire goddess Pele because she objects to plans to drill into Kilauea's flanks to get steam to generate electricity. Also, said this Hawaiian, who is called ''Uncle'' by those partying in the shade alongside the old house where he has lived 30 years, the fire goddess is in bad temper because Hawaiians, her people, long ago lost ownership of their land to whites. In the old Hawaiian religion, Pele controlled the volcanoes Mauna Loa and Kilauea and the paths taken by their lava flows were signs of her displeasure. Mr. Lanakila, pointing to the hill beneath the erupting 4,000-foot Kilauea, said: ''White people own it. It's a warning. She wiped out all those homes.'' He turned and peered through the palms to the sea 150 feet away. ''I always say leave it to Grandma; she knows what to do,'' he said, referring to Pele. The electric generating project in question has been built over five years with joint state and Federal financing. The geothermal electric plant has been installed and is operated by the Hawaii Electric Light Company, the electric utility for the island of Hawaii. The installation, which will be expanded to a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts by 1993, has not been threatened by the eruption because it is at a higher elevation. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory have a different explanation for the lava flows in November and December that have destroyed 28 homes, cut a major highway, knocked out telephone and power lines and carried molten lava to the sea for the first time since 1974. The scientists' theory is that the Hawaiian islands were each built up over millions of years by flows of melted rock that rose from a ''hot spot'' in the sea floor in the Pacific. #3 Million Years in Building The Pacific floor is 18,000 feet below the sea surface here, and Mauna Loa, rising 13,667 feet above the sea, is a single volcanic mass almost 32,000 feet tall. It is Earth's largest such volcanic mountain, three million years in building. In the two centuries over which records have been kept, Mauna Loa has put new lava over only 160,000 acres, and Kilauea over 38,000 acres. They are the only active Hawaiian volcanoes now. Both go into long periods of inactivity. But they erupted simultaneously March 30, 1984, for the first time since 1868. In that series of eruptions, which began at Kilauea in January 1984, Mauna Loa, after nine quiet years, sent a finger of lava to within seven miles of Hilo, this island's largest city. Meantime, Kilauea squirted spectacular fountains of molten rock hundreds of feet into the air and sent lava flows downhill in 1983 that destroyed 18 homes on the upper slopes well away from where recent damage occurred. Then, on July 20, lava began to flow from new place in the East Rift Zone, a crater-lined crack along Kilauea's flank 2,000 feet above here, seven miles uphill. It was ''pahoehoe'' lava, with temperatures over 2,200 degrees. The Hawaiian word, pronounced pah-hoy-hoy, describes a lava that flows like heavy pudding. Another Hawaiian word, ''aa,'' pronounced ah-ah, describes the chunky lava that looks like coal fire cinders. Nothing seems to stop the lava. Firefighters in November sprayed water on the advancing toe of a flow moving at about 100 feet an hour. Water hardened the toe and diverted it from the Louis Pau home near here. But a week later a new flow destroyed the house. ''You can't stop it or hate it,'' said Mr. Pau, a retired ranger in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Over 100 families were evacuated from threatened areas but they have moved back since the flow stopped coming down the hill on Dec. 19. The new vent continues to exude about 650,000 cubic yards of lava a day, according to scientists. But now the material stays on the hill to build the growing dome over the vent. The lava that devastated the settlements down the hill traveled through tubes beneath the dome that are created as lava on the flow surface cools and hotter lava beneath flows faster. Chuck Humphrey, a freelance photographer who moved here eight years ago, discussed some of the economic aspects of the four-year eruption. ''I couldn't afford to live here if it weren't for the lava,'' he said. ''Lots in my subdivision sold for $13,000 and now they go at $4,000.'' He looked around at the store, church, and houses that make up this small settlement. He came here to pick up his mail from one of a few dozen lock boxes in an open-sided shed that offers shelter from the rain. ''I'd guess about 90 houses were built around here in eight years,'' he said. ''This may slow things.'' The lava flow has cut him off from his mailbox. His home is just three miles from here, but with the road blocked by five-foot thick lava, and he must now walk or drive 60 miles until the highway reopens. Where homes were overrun, all that remains are corrugated sheets that were roofs, metal furnishings not rescued in time, and upper portions of coconut palms and mango trees that still smoulder where they were burned away from their roots by the advancing lava. Some homes had old cars in the yards, and decorative fences of piled rock. These have been partly buried in lava. One had an oramental iron gate, now drooping and misshapen, its supporting posts distorted by the heat and shoved askew by the lava's weight. Of the walls and floors, nothing remains."

It estimated that 4,000 United States-backed rebels had been killed and 2,600 wounded. 5 American optimism on arms control was expressed in a New Year's message by President Reagan to the Soviet people. He asserted that Moscow and Washington were closer now than ever before to an accord. 4 Mr. Reagan's address to Russians could be heard on some short-wave frequencies in Moscow, according to monitoring American diplomats. The Kremlin on Tuesday rejected any American-Soviet exchange of greetings. 4 Iran accused the U.S. of lacking ''good faith'' on returning $507.7 million in Iranian assets. Talks adjourned despite Teheran's seeing a settlement as near.

The New York Times, DOZENS ARE DEAD IN SAN JUAN AS BLASTS AND FIRE ENGULF BEACHFRONT TOURIST HOTEL," Fire raged through a packed high-rise hotel in the Condado Beach area this afternoon, killing dozens of tourists and injuring scores more. Helicopters plucked guests off the roof of the 22-story hotel, the Dupont Plaza, until late tonight. Smoke continued to billow from the structure as the Puerto Rican authorities attempted to determine the number of casualties. ''We have so far about 40 dead people,'' said Daniel Velez, press secretary to Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, and other officials and witnesses said the death toll could easily be higher. Explosions Reported ''There are many areas we have not been able to get into and don't know what we will find there,'' said Police Superintendent Jose Lopez Feliciano. Most of the bodies recovered after the fire were found in the lobby and casino, on the mezzanine level, and a restaurant on a lower level that serves a pool and the beach area. None of the victims were immediately identified. Without a full inspection of the interior, officials were not speculating on the cause of the fire, but a number of witnesses said they heard explosions at the time it broke out. The 450-room hotel, one of the largest tourist hotels in Puerto Rico, has a sprinkler system, but it was not immediately clear whether it had been working. Mr. Lopez Feliciano said the arson squad was investigating the fire and the reports of explosions. An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also talking to hotel personnel. 'Big Burst of Smoke' A witness, Kevin W. Condon, of Ansonia, Conn., said there were at least 70 people in the casino when he was playing blackjack and somebody said there was smoke. ''But nobody paid any attention, and we continued playing,'' he said. ''Then there was a big burst of smoke and we went running toward one of the exits. When someone opened the door, we saw that the whole hallway was covered with black smoke. We slammed the door, went running toward the other exit and that was filled with black smoke. Then the panic began.'' He said he broke a window with a chair and jumped from the mezzanine level to the ground, breaking his left leg. He said later at Pavia Hospital that he had seen two other people escape out the window, ''but I don't think anybody else got out of there.'' Fire Chief Francisco Ortiz Soto said that at least 50 were believed killed on the casino level. John Lolli, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who was in the casino when the fire began, said, ''The heat was so intense that people had to crawl out on their hands and knees.'' The injured were taken to a number of different hospitals and it was impossible to get an accurate idea of how many people were hurt in the fire. The Rio Pedras Medical Center, was treating 23 to 25 victims, most suffering from smoke inhalation, said Dr. Juan Nazario. Six or seven were in critical condition and the others were in stable condition, he said. An estimated 125 people were evacuated from the hotel by 7 P.M., the Coast Guard said. By 11:30 P.M. the fire and smoke had stopped and the authorities had shut down their rescue operation for the night, without a clear notion of the number of casualties or the cause of the inferno. Union Meeting in Ballroom The blaze apparently started at 3:30 P.M. in a ground-floor ballroom, minutes after the room had been used by hotel employees affiliated with the teamsters' union, which was bargaining a new contract. No officials suggested any link between the fire and the union Jose Cadiz, a teamster official, said the union had nothing to do with the fire. ''I know a lot of people are going to accuse the teamsters,'' he said. ''It's natural that if there was an impasse, people would think the union would do anything, but the union is not crazy.'' A hotel spokesman, who asked not be identified, said that almost immediately after the fire broke out an explosion was heard in the casino on the mezzanine floor. Flames quickly gutted the lower floors, where most of the deaths were reported. The hotel spokesman said he had been told there were several other explosions, including one in the kitchen. The worst of the fire was confined to the lobby, the poolside restaurant, kitchen, casino and gift shops on the two lower floors. Some of the guests who made it out of the building moved around looking for their loved ones. New Yorkers Among the Rescued Alicia Knupfer of Flushing, N.Y., said she was in an 11th-floor room when she saw smoke outside the window and found the hallway filled with smoke. ''The elevators weren't working and I went into the stairway in which people were climbing up on the roof,'' she said at the Pavia Hospital tonight. ''We started climbing up and when we got to the roof a Puerto Rico International helicopter picked us up with a large basket.'' The smoke-filled stairways left frightened guests uncertain whether they would escape. ''We heard a voice above us yelling, 'Keep coming, keep coming, you're almost there,' said Natalie David, 43 years old, of Manhattan. ''Until then we thought we would never make it. It was so black with smoke we couldn't see anything.'' #4 Jersey Teen-Agers Unhurt The Associated Press interviewed several hotel guests from the New York area who escaped injury. Among them were four 17-year-olds from North Jersey, Anthony Cannon, Timothy Conway, Alberto Mascaro and Kevin Twomey, all high school students from Bergen who said they were in Puerto Rico to watch their basketball team compete. They said they were by the pool when they heard two loud noises and the shattering of glass. ''It took us a long time to realize what was happening,'' Timothy was quoted as saying. Others who told the A.P. that they had heard explosions were Murray Bates, a jewelry manufacturer from North Woodmere, L.I., and Dr. Hiram Morganstein, an optometrist from Englewood Cliffs, N.J.. ''All of a sudden I see smoke coming from the kitchen - we heard that bomb go off and an explosion,'' said Dr. Morganstein, who was in a cafeteria with his wife, Pearl, and 22-year-old daughter, Audrey. ''It sounded like a hand grenade going off.'' Shower of Broken Glass Alexander Leighton, the owner of the Casablanca guest house across the street from the hotel, said he was walking his dog on the beach when he saw smoke coming from the lower floors of the building at 3:26 P.M. Then he saw flames on the ground floors, he said. ''People were running out of the pool area bleeding from cuts from glass that showered the area,'' he said. ''Two croupiers came running across the pool area and jumped into the pool with their clothing smoldering.'' The hotel spokesman said the management of the hotel, which is owned by Hotel Systems International of Anaheim, Calif., met with the teamsters' union Tuesday night at the Department of Labor, where the hotel gave the union what it said would be its final offer. ''The union said they would not accept it but they came to us this morning and asked for the use of a ballroom so they could take the offer to the union membership,'' he said. ''We gave them use of the ballroom,'' he said. ''After the meeting broke up, the doors were locked and then someone yelled fire. Moments after that there was an explosion in the casino.''"
The New York Times, BEIJING POLICE MOBILIZE TO PREVENT STUDENT PROTEST IN DEFIANCE OF BAN," The police blocked off much of Tiananmen Square today after posters at Beijing universities urged students to rally there New Year's Day to press their demands for political changes. Policemen stood at intervals of about 16 feet along the outside edge of the vast, central square, while another line of people in civilian clothes encircled the Monument to the People's Heroes at the south end. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students clustered around illegal wall posters at Beijing University, discussing politics and a possible New Year's Day demonstration on the square. Warning Is Issued A city official warned that anyone ''who dares make trouble in the capital of our great socialist motherland and on sacred Tiananmen Square will be severely punished.'' His comments, carried in the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, also accused the anti-Communist leadership of Taiwan of mobilizing ''secret agents'' to incite student demonstrators, the first time that charge has been made. The newly pasted-up wall posters at Beijing University accused the Government of failing to live up to its promises of democratic reform and urged students to take the lead in bringing freedom and democracy to China. A demonstration on Tiananmen Square would be the first Beijing rally by the students outside their isolated academic area in the northwest part of the capital. 'Attempt to Create Chaos' The municipal official, whose name was not used in the editorial statement, said ''a handful of elements hostile to the socialist system are planning to create disturbances on Tiananmen Square soon in an attempt to create chaos in Beijing, thus leading to nationwide chaos.'' Authorities say no arrests of students have been made so far in pro-democracy protests reported this month in at least 10 Chinese cities. Last Friday, following huge street marches in Shanghai and smaller ones in Beijing and elsewhere, Beijing authorities announced that those wanting to demonstrate must apply to police five days beforehand. The police said Wednesday that they received no requests for a demonstration at Tiananmen. The city also banned outright demonstrations at major sites such as the Great Hall of the People, right next to Tiananmen. One poster at Beijing University was signed in blood and called the present student movement ''epoch-making'' in significance. It said the Communist Party is fundamentally good but changes must be made in a nation where privilege still rules and peasants are regarded as subhuman. Students read the posters, which are banned, using flashlights and candles. Some recited the words into tape recorders, to be transcribed and passed on to other universities. Four or five large groups of students formed around individuals who were delivering speeches or debating various aspects of the democratic movement or the means students should take to support it. One student said students were under strong pressure from professors to stay away from the marches. Campaign Against Students Students have also been subject this past week to an increasingly vitriolic press campaign against their movement. The city official quoted on the front page of People's Daily on Wednesday said Taiwan's Voice of Free China radio on Dec. 17 instructed its special agents on the mainland to take ''unanimous actions at the appropriate time'' to abet the student protests. He said Taiwan has also told its agents ''to use various means to encourage and aid young students to bravely participate in the demonstrations.'' Wednesday's statement also attacked ''a certain foreign radio station'' for emphasizing the student demonstrations in ''inflammatory'' Chinese-language broadcasts. It apparently referred to Voice of America, which has a wide audience in China and for many students is a main source of news about other parts of the country. The same report said student unrest was being manipulated by ''a handful of elements hostile to socialism.''"
The New York Times, O'CONNOR SEES MIDEAST ROLE FOR VATICAN," Mayor Koch has gone out of his way this week to praise Cardinal O'Connor and to express understanding for the Cardinal's decision to cancel appointments with top-ranking Israeli officials because of opposition from the Vatican. ''The Cardinal is a prince of the church, and whatever he does always has to be within his own religious principles and requirements of his church, and that, of course, includes obliging Vatican protocol,'' the Mayor said in a page-and-a-half statement he issued without being asked. The Mayor is an outspoken supporter of Israel and of the Cardinal. He says quite often that he likes the Cardinal. Cardinal O'Connor's decision to revise his schedule in Israel generated protests from Israeli and American Jewish officials. But Mr. Koch called criticism of the Cardinal ''a great error.'' ''We, as Jews now, have no greater friend than the Cardinal,'' he said on Sunday, the day the Cardinal left. ''I admire him. I respect him. I have great affection for him. I believe no matter what the restraints, constraints are on this particular visit, good will come of it.'' Mr. Koch also said the Cardinal expressed ''the pain he personally felt in having to change his itinerary'' in a conversation they had on Saturday. He thinks the Vatican should recognize Israel, and should do so now, the Mayor added."
The New York Times, Of Rules and Prayer," When the new Senate convenes next Tuesday in the opening session of the 100th Congress, the body will be under the control of the Democrats and, as a result, will have a new parliamentarian. The current parliamentarian, Robert B. Dove, is something of a fixture in the Senate after 20 years' service, first as an assistant and then as chief parliamentarian since 1981. But he was drawn into a contretemps with the Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd, then in the minority, a few months ago on a complex procedural question after a cloture vote. The matter took a day and a half to resolve; by the time it was over, a ruling based on Mr. Dove's interpretation of procedure was overturned by an overwhelming 92-to-5 vote on the floor. Mr. Byrd, himself a master parliamentarian, is now the majority leader, and Mr. Dove is out of a job. Mr. Dove will be succeeded by Alan S. Frumin, now an assistant parliamentarian, who will officially assume his new duties Tuesday. Senator Byrd himself declined to discuss the reasons behind the change, but did take time in a telephone interview to bat down a rumor he was also planning to replace the Senate chaplain, Richard Halverson. ''I've never thought of firing the chaplain,'' the Senator said. ''In my view, the Lord's work is a little above partisan politics.''  WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING"
The New York Times, A Rally for Reagan," Citizens for America, President Reagan's steadfast grass-roots lobby, will hold an old-fashioned public rally on Monday to show support for the President amid the Iran arms affair. The noon rally, to be held at Lafayette Park across from the White House, will feature free food and refreshments and a lineup of speakers led by Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York and Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, an unswerving ally of the President. Buses are being lined up to transport the faithful from as far away as Boston. At the rally, supporters will pass out buttons and bumper stickers bearing the slogan ''America's with Reagan.'' And an old-time jazz band will play. The organizers invited other prominent Republicans to speak. The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, declined; he must prepare for the opening of the 100th Congress the following day but did not give the organizers that excuse or any other reason for not joining the rally. Vice President Bush, who, like both Mr. Kemp and Mr. Dole, is a likely 1988 Presidential contender, was also invited to speak, ''and has indicated his schedule is free but has not decided whether to speak,'' according to David Carmen, one of the organizers. The President himself enters Bethesda Naval Hospital on Sunday night for prostate surgery on Monday. WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING"

The New York Times, Perkins to Tampa Bay," Ray Perkins resigned as coach of Alabama yesterday and said he would return to the National Football League as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Perkins, who made an estimated $500,000 annually at Alabama in salary and endorsements as head football coach and director of athletics, would not disclose terms of his contract as Tampa Bay's coach and vice president of operations, but published reports put it at $750,000 a year. The 45-year-old Perkins, whose resignation is effective immediately, apologized to his players for not being able to discuss the situation with them. ''I do so with mixed emotions,'' Perkins said of his resignation. Hugh Culverhouse, the owner of the Buccaneers, who is a native of Birmingham and an Alabama graduate, begun discussions last Monday with Perkins, who declined two years ago to compete for the Buccaneers' job. Culverhouse dismissed Leeman Bennett as coach of the Buccaneers following consecutive 2-14 seasons. Perkins's teams were 32-15-1 in his four years at Alabama. Before succeeding Bear Bryant at Alabama, Perkins coached the Giants for four years, achieving a 24-35 record and taking them to the playoffs in 1981, their first playoff spot in 18 years. His 1986 team at Alabama capped a 10-3 campaign by defeating Washington in the Sun Bowl on Christmas Day. Perkins said he would make a recommendation to the school's president, Joab Thomas, if he were asked, but he would not disclose his choice as a successor. SPORTS PEOPLE"

The New York Times, Steroid Ruling Upheld," A Federal judge in New Orleans upheld a National Collegiate Athletic Association ruling forbidding Roland Barbay, the Louisiana State defensive end, from playing in the Sugar Bowl because tests showed he had used steroids last spring. Ruling from the bench because of the short time before the New Year's Day kickoff, United States District Judge Robert Collins said Barbay had failed to show there was a constitutional issue involved. Prior to the ruling, an N.C.A.A. lawyer read sworn testimony in which Barbay contradicted his earlier public statement that he had taken the steroid on the advice of a physician. Of some 2,000 football players tested this bowl season, 11 have shown positive for steroid use. Barbay is the only one known to have gone to court over the matter. Barbay's lawyer, Nick Noriea, said that even if Judge Collins had declared Barbay eligible for today's L.S.U.'s game today in the Sugar Bowl against Nebraska, his client would have been benched either by Coach Bill Arnsparger or under orders of the school.

The New York Times, Yanks Dismiss Scala," The Yankees announced yesterday they had dismissed Dom Scala, their bullpen catcher, and replaced him with Mike Sennell, a catcher in the Yankees organization from 1983-85. There were reports that Scala was discharged because too much of his time was being taken up by his own business, which is the manufacture of jewelry carrying the logos of major leagues teams. Woody Woodward, the general manager, said the decision to replace Scala was ''strictly a baseball decision.

Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, said that he did, but that he doubted whether the N.C.A.A. would listen to him. ''I wouldn't have the clout that St. Joe would,'' he said. Johnson then began trying to mitigate the flippancy of his remark, saying it had been made partly in jest but also out of respect for Joe Paterno, his Penn State counterpart, ''for all the fantastic things he has done for college football.'' He did not sound convincing. An hour later, Paterno arrived for his own daily interview, having already been briefed about Johnson's comment. ''I left my halo home,'' he said, a mischievous look in his eye as he stepped toward the podium. And, of his casual dress, he added: ''I wanted to wear one of my unsaintly outfits.'' That made it 2-1, St. Joe, and then Paterno started running up the score. Near the end of the interview, when asked how his team would spend the afternoon awaiting game time tomorrow night, he said: ''We'll sit around and pray a little. I say mass every day.''  SCOUTING"

The New York Times, Was It Just a Scheme To Pay for the Contras?," To the Editor: Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North has perhaps wisely chosen to place his trust in the Lord (news story, Dec. 19), just as the currency of the nation suggests. He quotes Psalm 7: ''O Lord my God, in Thee do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me, lest like a lion they rend me, dragging me away with none to rescue.'' So far, so good. The verse immediately following, however, continues: ''O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is any wrong in my hands, if I have requited my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause, let the enemy pursue me and overtake me, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my soul in the dust.'' Usually it is good advice to read less selectively and more completely if one chooses to quote the Bible; it has an uncanny capacity to zap the quoter. JEAN S. BERG  St. Louis, Dec. 19, 1986"
The New York Times, New Executive Lineup Follows Pandick Buyout," A new management lineup, with Anthony K. Moulton as chief executive, is emerging at Pandick Inc., the New York-based financial printing company, after the completion of a management buyout this week. Mr. Moulton, 42, is now the president of Pandick. Edward G. Green, 68, the chairman and chief executive, plans to retire. Another principal in the buyout, Garry L. Pote, 45, will continue as chief financial officer. ''I don't think we'll have a chairman's title,'' Mr. Pote said. ''Titles are not that important to Tony anyway.'' Mr. Moulton agreed. ''We work together so well as a team that we never had made a big deal about titles,'' he said. Mr. Moulton was speaking from Mr. Green's vacation home in the Adirondacks, where he was relaxing after the successful tender offer. The Charles P. Young Company, a unit of the Services Resources Corporation, withdrew from the bidding this week after it lost a court battle to block the management buyout, which involved 20 Pandick managers. Mr. Moulton is married to Mr. Green's daughter, Arden. They have a boy and a girl. Mr. Green's desire to retire set off plans in mid-September to buy the company and go private, Mr. Moulton said. ''After building up this company for 20 years, he said, 'I've had it,' and I said to him, 'I can't blame you.' '' The financial printing business is changing technologically and Pandick had taken diversification steps to get into new technology. But it has taken time for the strategy to pay off, Mr. Moulton said, and Wall Street's insistence on quarter-to-quarter performance made it difficult to remain a public company. ''The public stockholder pays a price for that,'' Mr. Pote said. ''It's not fair to the stockholder or management.'' Their plans were upset for a time by the rival offer to the buyout plan. ''We were not expecting any other bids,'' Mr. Moulton said. Mr. Moulton and Mr. Pote were both trained as investment bankers. Mr. Moulton joined Pandick 10 years ago from L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, and Mr. Pote joined in March after two years with the Banque National de Paris. BUSINESS PEOPLE"
The New York Times, Was It Just a Scheme To Pay for the Contras?," To the Editor: Politicians of both parties these days say our nation cannot afford to have a paralyzed Presidency. But can it afford not to have one? An inactive Presidency is surely better than a misdirected one. This Administration needs a good long pause for reflection and recommitment. More to be feared than paralysis is some precipitate, dangerous act to divert attention from what needs correction. ERNEST DICKINSON  Chappaqua, N.Y., Dec. 23, 1986"
The New York Times, Ginnie Mae's President Lured Back to Nebraska," Glenn Wilson says he has mixed feelings about going home to Nebraska after two years in Washington as president of the Government National Mortgage Association. ''I had just refinanced my house and started some construction and was planning to stay a while,'' Mr. Wilson said yesterday. Being part of the Reagan Administration and dealing with Wall Street and others has been exciting, he said, but he decided that he had an opportunity that was too good to pass by. Mr. Wilson has decided to quit Ginnie Mae, as it is called, to go to Omaha as president of the Firstier Mortgage Company, a unit of Firstier Inc., a bank holding company. ''I'm 48 years old,'' he said. ''At maximum I would have another two years here. When this opportunity came to head the largest mortgage banking company in Nebraska, I decided to take it. There are not going to be a lot of comparable oportunities.'' A large pay increase over his annual Government salary of $74,500 was ''part of the attraction,'' he said. ''But there are several other things. My children and grandchildren are in Nebraska. Almost all of my business and social friends are there, and my company and investments are in Nebraska.'' Mr. Wilson, a graduate of Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, was a developer and contractor in Grand Island, Neb., for 10 years, mostly in residential building. Before that he was national director of Young Republicans and later chairman of Nebraska Republicans. He directed President Reagan's election campaign in the state in 1980 and 1984. Ginnie Mae, which is part of the Housing and Urban Development Department, guarantees mortgage-backed securities made up of pools of mortgages. In its 17 years, Mr. Wilson said, the association has issued $263 billion in Ginnie Mae securities, with more than half written or rewritten during his tenure. Lower inflation and interest rates have given people the opportunity to refinance and buy new housing at a more affordable interest rate, he said. Mr. Wilson, a Presidential appointee, said no one had yet been indicated as his successor. ''The process is a relatively slow one,'' he said. Mr. Wilson joins the Nebraska bank Feb. 2.

The New York Times, How China's Leaders Use Student Protests," In virtually all the reports about the recent student demonstrations in China, little has been said of the restraint shown by the Chinese Communist Party. Given its tremendous power, China's one-party state could have easily nipped these demonstrations at the very beginning. Yet, even as party leaders harshly denounced the demonstrators, they allowed a protest for a more open nominating process to peoples' congresses to expand into a more general demand for competitive elections and freedom of speech. The demonstrations spread for at least four weeks to China's major cities, including the capital. There are several reasons for the party's relative tolerance, including its desire to project a moderate image abroad; memories of the Cultural Revolution and a desire not to provoke another reign of terror by cracking down too harshly; and, most important, the fact that the demonstrations serve the interests of certain factions at the top levels of political leadership in ongoing debates over reform. Since the spring of 1986, the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, and his reform faction have called for political reforms to accompany economic changes. They argue that China's openness and economic development cannot be sustained unless the party decentralizes its power and reduces its role in economic management. Their attempt to gain acceptance of such a proposal at a Central Committee meeting last September was blocked by conservative leaders, led by the Politburo member and economic planner Chen Yun. The final resolution talked about building socialist spiritual civilization rather than reforming the political system. Nevertheless, the debate on politi cal reform continues and encompasses more radical suggestions. Some intellectuals insist political reform should not be merely a tool of economic reform. Others urge the party to lessen its role not only in the economy but also in the judiciary, the Government and everyday life. Although these recommendations and the student protests call for more far-reaching reforms than the Deng leadership seeks, Mr. Deng and his reform group use these protests to exert pressure on top leaders for their more limited reforms. This is not the first time they have done this. In the late 1970's, they allowed the so-called Democratic Movement to use wall posters, pamphlets and demonstrations to force out the remaining Maoists in the central leadership and to launch their own economic program. With Mr. Deng's goals achieved, he cracked down on democratic activists. A similar scenario may be unfolding today. In order to bring about limited political reform, the Deng leadership may have allowed student demonstrations to spread and capture the nation's attention. Yet after four weeks, he as well as the conservative leaders have gradually suppressed the protestors. If the demonstrations become too disruptive, the conservatives may use them as an excuse to call for an end or evena reversal of previous reforms, as they attempted to do in the ''spiritual pollution'' campaign in the fall of 1983. While the top leaders may be able to manipulate demonstrations for their own purposes, almost invariably the protests set in motion ideas and actions they cannot wholly control. In a similar fashion, Mao Zedong used the Red Guard demonstrations during the Cultural Revolution to purge the opposing political faction. His call ''to rebel against authority'' led to anarchy, which he finally suppressed with violence. But it also ultimately led to the Democratic Movement of the late 1970's. Although Mr. Deng initially used the Democratic Momement for his own purposes in the late 1970's, he too reined in the activists when they demanded more democratic rights than he was willing to allow. Yet their demands have stimulated the current debate on political reform. Even though the student demonstrations are now waning, China's recent history suggests that demonstrations, manipulated to exert pressure on the leaders at the top, ofter spark ideas and practices that the manipu-lators cannot fully extinguish."
The New York Times, A.T.&T. Payment To Alascom Ends," The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has been relieved of a $1.25 million monthly payment that the Federal Communications Commission had ordered it to pay to Alascom Inc., Alaska's major long-distance telephone company. The fee was imposed on A.T.&T. in 1981 as a way to ease the transition as Alaska was integrated into the nationwide telephone payments pool that partially equalizes the cost of telephone service in areas that are cheap to serve with those where distances make providing service expensive."
The New York Times, Genentech Buyout," Genentech Inc., a leading biotechnology company based in South San Francisco, said its limited partners had approved the company's early buyout of two research partnerships. The partnerships had sponsored the development of three promising drugs - growth hormone, interferon and a blood clot dissolver. The buyback, which will cost Genentech more than $400 million, received a majority vote despite the opposition of two partners who argued that the original agreement, which would pay them a royalty on sales, was worth more.
