# political_bias

In this project, my team-members and I used the weak supervision method to annotate unlabelled data using a strongly labelled dataset and a weakly labelled dataset. Finally a convolutional neural network was used to classify sentences according to the two political ideologies: Liberal and Conservative (in the US). A detailed description of the method could be seen in the report **Final_report.pdf**
